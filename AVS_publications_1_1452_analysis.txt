We investigated how three such characteristics, basal area, canopy cover and canopy closure, were related to each other in structurally complex mixed forests. We also asked how well they can predict the light-demand signature of the forest understorey (estimated as the mean Ellenberg indicator value for light [EIVLIGHT] and the proportion of forest specialists [%FS] within the plots). Furthermore, we asked whether accounting for the shade-casting ability of individual canopy species could improve predictions ofEIV(LIGHT)and %FS. Location A total of 192 study plots from nineteen temperate forest regions across Europe. Methods In each plot, we measured stand basal area (all stems >7.5 cm diameter), canopy closure (with a densiometer) and visually estimated the percentage cover of all plant species in the herb (<1 m), shrub (1-7 m) and tree layer (>7 m). We used linear mixed-effect models to assess the relationships between basal area, canopy cover and canopy closure. We performed model comparisons, based onR(2)and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), to assess which stand characteristics can predictEIV(LIGHT)and %FSbest, and to assess whether canopy shade-casting ability can significantly improve model fit. Results Canopy closure and cover were weakly related to each other, but showed no relation with basal area. For bothEIV(LIGHT)and %FS, canopy cover was the best predictor. Including the share of high-shade-casting species in both the basal-area and cover models improved the model fit forEIV(LIGHT), but not for %FS. Conclusions The typically expected relationships between basal area, canopy cover and canopy closure were weak or even absent in structurally complex mixed forests. In these forests, easy-to-measure structural canopy characteristics were poor predictors of the understorey light-demand signature, but accounting for compositional characteristics could improve predictions."	32	0	0	0	28	0	32	2020-10-18	WOS:000579396600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

"Radial growth responses to gap creation in large, old Sequoiadendron giganteum"	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	13	4	NA	NA	498	509	NA	10.1111/j.1654-109X.2010.01089.x	Article	OCT 2010	2010	"Questions: Do large, old Sequoiadondron giganteum trees respond to the creation of adjacent canopy gaps? Do other co-occurring tree species and younger S. giganteum adjacent to gaps also respond? What are the likely factors affecting growth responses?Location: Mixed-conifer forests of the southern Sierra Nevada, California, USA.Methods: We measured the growth response of large, old S. giganteum trees (mean DBH=164 cm; ages estimated > 1000 yr) to gap creation by coring trees and comparing growth after gap creation to growth before gap creation. We also measured young Abies concolor, Pinus lambertiana, and young S. giganteum. Gap-adjacent trees were compared with non-adjacent reference trees. Tree rings were analysed for carbon isotope discrimination and for longer-term growth trend correlations with climate.Results: Following gap creation gap-adjacent old S. giganteum grew more than reference trees. Abies concolor trees also exhibited a growth response to gap creation. No response was detected for young S. giganteum or P. lambertiana, although detection power was lower for these groups. There was no difference in carbon isotope discrimination response to gap creation between gap-adjacent and reference trees for old S. giganteum and radial growth was positively correlated with winter precipitation, but not growing season temperature.Conclusion: It is unclear what caused the growth release in old S. giganteum trees, although liberation of below-ground resources following removal of competing vegetation appears to be a significant contributor. Sequoiadondron giganteum, the third-longest lived and the largest of all species, remains sensitive to local environmental changes even after canopy emergence. Management activities that reduce vegetation surrounding individual specimen trees can be expected to result in increased vigor of even these very old and large trees."	19	0	0	0	16	0	21	2010-10-01	WOS:000281556100010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Then, we present another family of models based on Tuxen's definition of potential natural vegetation that play an important role, especially in Europe, for landscape planning and management. While neutral landscape models by their very nature do not take into account vegetation dynamics, nor abiotic constraints to vegetation distribution, the concept of potential natural vegetation includes the effects of vegetation dynamics in a spatially explicit manner.

This land use and herbivory combined effect is particularly relevant for woody plant juveniles, which are key stages for regeneration. We aimed to understand how herbivory on juvenile woody plants is affected by land use. In this study, we analyzed how vertebrate and invertebrate herbivory patterns on seedlings and saplings change between land uses in winter and summer seasons.LocationSouthernmost Gran Chaco region, C & oacute;rdoba province, central Argentina.MethodologyWe assessed the invertebrate and vertebrate herbivory on seedlings and saplings of woody species during summer and winter seasons at four different land use types of a Chaco dry forest. Land use types were classified according to the increasing intensity of disturbance (logging and grazing) they are subjected to: Conserved Forest (CF; no disturbance), Secondary Forest (SF; low disturbance), Closed Species-rich Shrubland (CS; intermediate disturbance), and Open Shrubland (OS; high disturbance).ResultsWe found that total herbivory was consistently higher in SF and CS in both seasons. Vertebrate herbivory was higher than invertebrate herbivory in winter (except in CF), with the inverse pattern in summer. Differences between seedling and sapling stages were scarce, with not consistent patterns of herbivory between seasons.ConclusionsThis study shows a pronounced effect of land use on seasonal herbivory patterns and dynamics. The vegetation structure of communities under low and intermediate disturbance intensities would promote diversity of invertebrate herbivores, which, combined with cattle introduction, could result in herbivory complementation and additivity. Understanding how environmental filters, like anthropic activities and herbivory, interplay and affect early growth stages is crucial to achieving land use practices that do not compromise forest resilience and regeneration."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-05-08	WOS:001478327700001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

We hypothesized that disturbances and their timing affect plant and bryophyte species richness and other indicators of conservation success. More specifically, we expected conservation status to improve with disturbances that mimic natural grazing processes, that is, that extensive year-round grazing with trampling had a more positive effect than intensive summer grazing or mowing. Location Kastbjerg wetlands, Jutland, Denmark. Methods In a three-year field experiment, we applied trampling, season-specific defoliation with biomass removal and burning in a randomized design in nine wetland sites. We recorded species richness and community composition. Bayesian generalized linear mixed-effects models were built with treatment as fixed effect, site as random effect and species richness or species composition as responses. Leaf N and P, and soil moisture were included as covariables. Further, a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) was applied to test for discrimination between treatments based on a set of biodiversity indicators. Results Environmental and biotic differences among sites were considerable and significant indicating a considerable effect of historical contingency (local species pool). We found only minor and mostly insignificant effects of disturbance on vegetation. However, a QDA revealed significant differences among treatments based on five indicators for conservation status. Simulated grazing and trampling were generally associated with higher vascular plant richness, bryophyte richness, number of indicator species and stress-tolerant species and decreasing abundance of competitive species. Conclusion We found small, but positive effects of disturbance on biodiversity indicators of wetland vegetation after three years of experimental treatments. Initial site differences explained most variation, indicating strong historical contingency. Our results support the need for restoration of disturbances in fens and meadows, and the importance of prioritizing areas with near-natural biotas."	6	0	0	0	3	0	6	2022-06-14	WOS:000805854900001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Protecting such fragments is a priority to halt further biological degradation, but its effectiveness depends on external impacts on the fragments. In this study, we ask: how does woody vegetation in protected old-forest fragments vary depending on management of their adjacent areas, also in combination with natural site conditions? What are the management impacts on habitat quality of the fragments in the long term? Location Pinus-dominated and Picea mixed-wood forests in Estonia (hemiboreal Europe). Methods Forest structure and microclimate were measured at the edge and interior of protected old-forest fragments. Woody vegetation layers, shrub species composition, coarse woody debris, and presence of cut stumps were measured in 107 fragments (adjacent to clearcuts, partial cuts, and unthinned production forests) and in 20 control stands embedded within natural forest. Air temperature and humidity were measured at the edges vs the interior of mixed-woods. Edge age effects were explored along 80 years of post-harvest chronosequences. Results All edge types studied had multiple, partly forest-type-specific, external effects on stand structure. Some clear-cutting effects on woody layers reversed in later decades, but there was also persistent impoverishment of deadwood pools of the fragments probably related to unreported tree removal. There was a likely indirect pathway of edge effects through overstorey loss, and shrub cover was reduced in the long term. Exotic species were rare. Edges at clear-cut stands influenced humidity regimes rather than temperature regimes. Conclusions The moderate external effects on stand structure were tightly linked to low overstorey mortality and a lack of exotic species across the forest landscapes studied. Changes in these key factors constitute risks for the future. Protecting set-asides from occasional tree cutting, and establishing forest buffers around small fragments and as a precautionary strategy are current priorities in these forest landscapes."	6	0	0	0	1	0	6	2022-04-22	WOS:000779497100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Shrub facilitation drives tree establishment in a semiarid fog-dependent ecosystem	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	21	1	NA	NA	113	120	NA	10.1111/avsc.12301	Article	JAN 2018	2018	"QuestionsThe exceptional occurrence of tall rain forest patches on foggy coastal mountaintops, surrounded by extensive xerophytic shrublands, suggests an important role of plant-plant interactions in the origin and persistence of these patches in semi-arid Chile. We asked whether facilitation by shrubs can explain the growth and survival of rain forest tree species, and whether shrub effects depend on the identity of the shrub species itself, the drought tolerance of the tree species and the position of shrubs in regard to wind direction.LocationOpen area-shrubland-forest matrix, Fray Jorge Forest National Park, Chile.MethodsWe recorded survival after 12years of a similar to 3600 tree saplings plantation (originally similar to 30-cm tall individuals) of Aextoxicon punctatum, Myrceugenia correifolia and Drimys winteri placed outside forests, beneath the shrub Baccharis vernalis, and in open (shrub-free) areas. We assessed the effects of neighbouring shrubs and soil humidity on survival and growth along a gradient related to the direction of fog movement.ResultsB. vernalis had a clear facilitative effect on tree establishment and survival since, after similar to 12years, saplings only survived beneath the shrub canopy. Long-term survival strongly depended on tree species identity, drought tolerance and position along the soil moisture gradient, with higher survival of A. punctatum (>35%) and M. correifolia (>14%) at sites on wind- and fog-exposed shrubland areas. Sites occupied by the shrub Aristeguietia salvia were unsuitable for trees, presumably due to drier conditions than under B. vernalis.ConclusionsInteractions between shrubs and fog-dependent tree species in dry areas revealed a strong, long-lasting facilitation effect on planted tree's survival and growth. Shrubs acted as benefactors, providing sites suitable for tree growth. Sapling mortality in the shrubland interior was caused by lower soil moisture, the consequence of lower fog loads in the air and thus insufficient facilitation. While B. vernalis was a key ecosystem engineer (nurse) and intercepted fog water that dripped to trees planted underneath, drier sites with A. salvia were unsuitable for trees. Consequently, nurse effects related to water input are strongly site and species specific, with facilitation by shrubs providing a plausible explanation for the initiation of forest patches in this semi-arid landscape."	12	0	0	0	9	1	13	2018-03-13	WOS:000425120600013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Are there differences among species in their preference for coniferous vs. deciduous forest? 2. Are tree and shrub species better colonizers of recent forest stands than herbaceous species? 3. Do colonization patterns of plant species groups depend on tree species composition?Location: Three deciduous and one coniferous recent forest areas in Brandenburg, NE Germany.Methods: fit 34 and 2 1 transects in coniferous and deciduous stands, respectively. we studied the occurrence and percentage cover of vascular plants in a total of 150 plots in ancient stands, 3 15 in recent stands and 55 at the ecotone. Habitat preference, diaspore weight, generative dispersal potential and clonal extension were used to explain mechanisms of local migration. Regression analysis was conducted to test whether migration distance was related to species' life-history traits.Results: 25 species were significantly associated with ancient stands and ten species were significantly more frequent in recent stands. Tree and shrub species were good colonizers of recent coniferous and deciduous stands. In the coniferous stands, all herbaceous species showed a strong dispersal limitation during colonization. whereas in the deciduous stands generalist species may have survived in the grasslands which were present prior to afforestation.Conclusions: The fast colonization of recent stands by trees and shrubs can be explained by their effective dispersal via wind and animals. This, and the comparably efficient migration of herbaceous forest specialists into recent coniferous stands, implies that the conversion of coniferous into deciduous stands adjacent to ancient deciduous forests is promising even without planting of trees."	18	0	0	0	22	1	23	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

How does the relationship between seed bank and vegetation change? What are the implications for seed bank dynamics?Location: An ancient Quercus petraea - Carpinus betulus forest in conversion from coppice-with-standards to regular Quercus high forest near Montargis, France.Methods: Seed bank and vegetation were sampled in six replicated stand types, forming a chronosequence along the conversion pathway. The stand types represented mid-successional stages of stands in transition from coppice-with-standards (to high forest (16 plots) and early-and mid-successional high forest stands (32 plots).Results: Seed bank density and species richness decreased with time since last disturbance. Adjusting for seed density effects obscured species richness differences between stand types, but species of later seres were nested subsets of earlier seres, implying concomitant shifts in species richness and composition with time since disturbance. Later seres were characterized by species with low seed weight and high seed longevity. Seed banks of early seres were more similar to vegetation than to later seres.Conclusions: Abandonment of the coppice-with-standards regime altered the seed bank characteristics, as well as its relationship with vegetation. Longer management cycles under high forest yield impoverished seed banks. For their persistence, seed bank species will increasingly rely on management of permanently open areas in the forest landscape. Thus, revegetation at the beginning of new high-forest cycles may increasingly depend on inflow from seed sources."	42	0	0	0	42	0	51	2008-04-01	WOS:000255229600012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Location: Liminka Bay, W Finland, 25degree21'70 N,64degree51'90 E. Methods: We constructed a matrix population model based on colonization and disappearance events and patch size changes of A.fulva. Patches were divided into hydric and non-hydric zones according to proximity to the seashore and intensity of disturbance. Perturbation analyses were carried out in order to identify transitions critical for population growth. Seed bank and seed germination studies provided background information for the model design. Results: A. fulva patches observed in the more disturbed hydric zone (closest to the sea) increased in number, as did the total number of patches. However, the number of patches in the less disturbed non-hydric zone decreased. Conclusions: Short-term dynamics of the A.fulva population at Liminka Bay seem to be determined by environmental fluctuations. which cause annual variation in transition rates between patch size classes. The long-term dynamics are probably governed by initiation of primary succession by isostatic land uplift. Increased disturbance at the water's edge may promote persistence of A.fulva through reduced interspecific competition. Our results suggest that shoreline disturbance of the hydric zone is sufficient for maintaining a viable population. Competitive exclusion of A. fulva in the non-hydric zone may be delayed by management practices, such as mowing."	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	2004-11-01	BCI:BCI200500082083	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

They are structurally characterised by mosaics of open habitat patches, individual trees and groups of trees or shrubs. We investigated whether these semi-open habitats may act as stepping stones and thus as dispersal corridors for both plants from woodlands and open habitats to mitigate habitat fragmentation effects. We (a) contrasted the plant communities in semi-open habitats with those of woodlands and open habitats, and (b) explored which life-history traits or environmental requirements are associated with the presence or absence of species in semi-open habitats. Location Swabian Jura, South Germany; Lueneburg Heath, North Germany. Methods We selected four study sites in two contrasting landscapes and conducted vegetation surveys and analysed canopy closure and soil chemical properties in four different habitat types: woodlands, semi-open habitats with high and low canopy closure and open habitats. We tested whether habitat type affected species composition, identified habitat-specific indicator species and compared Ellenberg indicator values for light and moisture and species' dispersal and establishment traits across these habitat types. Results Plant communities of woodlands were significantly different from those of all other habitat types, whereas open habitats showed some similarities to semi-open habitats. On average, 73% of open habitat and 39% of woodland species were present in semi-open habitats. Habitat requirements as well as dispersal and establishment traits of woodland species were often more specialised and differed from those of species of the other habitat types, making them less capable to disperse into semi-open habitats. Conclusions Semi-open corridors have the potential to connect patches of open habitats and to a lesser extent also of woodlands without creating new barriers for either habitat type. Thus, semi-open corridors may counteract habitat fragmentation effects and are a promising tool for biodiversity conservation, particularly in fragmented pasture landscapes."	4	1	0	0	4	0	4	2020-09-13	WOS:000568603700001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Each treatment was replicated three times at each of three sites dominated by the same tree species but having different soil textures (clay, silty loam, sandy). Community composition and taxonomic diversity (species richness, species evenness, Shannon diversity index) were quantified based on woody species abundance sampled 5, 10 and 15yr after disturbance. Community composition response was assessed using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, dispersion and divergence) was also estimated using eight species effect and response traits. Finally, we examined community recovery as well as responses of species and functional diversity to disturbance severity over time using repeated measures ANOVA.ResultsTwo responses indicated a potentially negative impact of whole-tree harvest relative to conventional, stem-only harvest: functional richness on silty loam soils and species evenness on clayey soils. Otherwise, negative impacts were restricted to forest floor removal or increased compaction. Recovery in community composition was reduced by the most severe treatments, particularly forest floor removal, across the study, but the responses of functional and taxonomic diversity varied among sites, with some measures increasing as a result of severe disturbance.ConclusionsMaximization of standing biomass may mean a short-term sacrifice in species and functional diversity.

Can chemical ecology and diverse planting designs be applied to decrease herbivory in tropical reforestation? Location Reforestation plantings in Heredia, Costa Rica. Methods This study directly evaluates the effects of herbivory on seedling growth and the role of two putative plant defences, saponins and leaf toughness, in limiting herbivory in reforestation. Four planting treatments were studied in a replicated block design in cattle pastures in Costa Rica: (1) a monoculture of a fast-growing species low in saponins (Dipteryx panamensis); (2) a monoculture of a slower-growing, saponin-rich species (Cojoba arborea); (3) a polyculture consisting of half D. panamensis and half three other defended species; and (4) a polyculture of half C. arborea and half the same other defended species. Growth and herbivory were measured every 6 mo during the first 2 yr of plot development and again after 5 yr of growth. Results Dipteryx panamensis was the fastest-growing species, and individuals planted in polycultures grew faster in terms of height than individuals in monoculture. Herbivory was negatively related to sapling growth, and damage during the first 6 mo of plot establishment decreased growth even after 5 yr. Patterns of herbivory varied through time, resulting in changes in the importance of plant defences. For example, leaf toughness, which is an effective defence against many herbivores, was negatively related to herbivory at multiple time periods. In contrast, saponins were not a deterrent to all herbivores, so they were not consistently effective as a defence; however saponins were negatively related to Atta cephalotes (leaf-cutter ant) damage. Saponins are therefore a promising defence against leaf-cutter ants but not against all herbivores. Conclusions Plantinsect interactions influence reforestation through growth-limiting herbivore pressure on seedlings, and this herbivory is likely facilitated by reforestation methods that favour monocultures of fast-growing species that lack strong antiherbivore defences.

Late-Holocene fire history in a forest-grassland mosaic in southern Brasil:: Implications for conservation	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	10	1	NA	NA	81	90	NA	10.1658/1402-2001(2007)10[81:LFHIAF]2.0.CO;2	Article	APR 2007	2007	"Question: Is the diverse mosaic of forest/grassland (Campos) vegetation on the hills in the Porto Alegre region natural or of anthropogenic origin? What are the best approaches to management and conservation of forest/grassland mosaics in southern Brazil?Location: 280 m a.s.l., Rio Grande do Sul State (30 degrees 04'32S; 51 degrees 06'05W, southern Brazil.Methods: A 50-cm long radiocarbon dated sediment core from a swamp on Morro Santana was analysed for pollen and charcoal, and multivariate data analysis was used to reconstruct past vegetation and fire dynamics.Results: The formation of swamp deposits is related to a change to wetter climatic conditions since 1230 cal yr BP. The diverse forest/grassland mosaic existed already at that time and can be seen as natural in origin as it has been also shown from other studies n southern Brazil. Since 580 cal yr BP, forests expanded continuously. The marked higher occurrence of the pioneer Myrsine during the last 70 years, indicates a change in the disturbance regime. In the past, vegetation has been influenced by mostly anthropogenic fire, set first by Amerindians and later by European settlers.Conclusions: Management for conservation of forest/grassland mosaics should take into account, first, that grasslands are remnants of earlier drier Holocene periods and not a result of deforestation and, second, the history of disturbance by grazing and ire. Suppression of grazing and burning has likely resulted in a trend towards more woody vegetation under modern wet climatic conditions. If management for conservation excludes fire, the present grassland patches will tend to disappear due to forest expansion under the modern humid climate. Maintaining or reintroducing cattle grazing in conservation areas could be an alternative to fire."	68	1	0	0	59	9	79	2007-04-01	WOS:000245934700010	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Vegetation and above-ground biomass were compared between pre-flood conditions and those nine years after flooding. Peat accumulation since flooding was also quantified.Results: Flooding caused almost all trees to die, leading to a net loss of 86% of the above-ground living plant biomass after nine years of the flooding. Floating up of peat was rapid in the central part of the basin, and the floating peat mats were characterized by newly established open bog community. Wetland types were diversified from bog into open bog, fen, and marsh, accompanied with great species turnover. Floating open bog community accumulated the greatest amount of peat since flooding.Conclusions: This study shows that shallow flooding of bog vegetation can lead to quick re-establishment of open bog vegetation upon the floating up of peat mats as well as changes to more diverse vegetation over decadal time spans. We estimate that the carbon pools in 2002 in living and dead plant biomass since 1992 are comparable to what they were in the above-ground biomass in 1992. Flooding caused an initial net decrease in carbon stores, but carbon in the pre-flood living plant biomass was replaced by both carbon in dead biomass of the pre-flood vegetation and newly sequestered carbon in new peat growth and post-flood living plant biomass. Possible vegetation change toward bog-dominated system could lead to increasing rate of new peat growth, which could affect future carbon sink/source strength of the system."	23	0	0	0	19	0	37	2005-11-01	WOS:000235079600011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Species recruited into the tree layer (> 2.0 m tall) were monitored for 11 years (1991 - 2001) and fire occurrence and herbaceous biomass assessed annually to determine fuel loads.Results: Fire frequency was variable at the study sites and fuel loads were generally too low to suppress woodland regeneration after felling. However, at one site a change from low to high fire frequency arrested woodland development and triggered a regression towards a 'fire-trap' vegetation type in which a few fire-tolerant species survived. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that miombo woodland regeneration is facilitated by a sere of fire-tolerant species. All regrowth after felling was from resprouting plants present before felling. Trees with a previous history of felling sprouted more vigorouslv than trees that had not been felled before. Species richness ill the tree layer increased with time since felling because resprout species had different height growth rates.Conclusion: The resilience of miombo trees after clear-felling is largely due to their capacity to regenerate vegetatively from resprouts and stumps after release from frequent fires. Coppicing is therefore recommended as a suitable management technique for miombo, woodland in central southern Africa."	36	2	0	0	28	0	37	2004-11-01	WOS:000225645800011	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Turfs were cut at three different depths, creating a gradient from organic to mineral soils. Germination and establishment of A. montana were negatively correlated with turf cutting depth. The removal of organic matter resulted in a major decrease in organic fraction of the soil and its nutrients. It also resulted in a considerable decrease in moisture content and humic acids. Additional liming after turf cutting increased germination and establishment in all plots and at all depths.Germination experiments under controlled conditions in a climate chamber revealed a significantly higher germination at low aluminium/calcium (Al:Ca) ratios. High Al:Ca ratios resulted in poor germination, suggesting Al toxicity. Addition of humic acids increased germination, even at high Al:Ca ratios, suggesting immobilization of Al by humic acids.It is concluded that turf cutting can have a marked effect on the success of heathland restoration. It results in the intended removal of the eutrophic layer but also in the unintentional removal of much of the buffering mechanisms and/or Al immobilizing compounds. Additional buffering and/or less deep turf cutting may be necessary to allow germination and establishment of rare herbaceous species such as A. montana."	29	0	0	0	25	0	29	2003-12-01	WOS:000220133300003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Trunks were chosen at random within selected blocks in both managed and unmanaged Fagus stands.117 trunks in 43 sample plots in three forests were investigated. Cover was estimated for 72 lichens, 29 bryophytes and two fungi on vertical trunks 0.3 -2 m above ground. 18 explanatory variables were recorded and arranged in three groups: eight management-related variables, six micro-climatic- and soil variables, and four geographical- and geological variables. Canonical Correspondence Analysis was used to test and to quantify the explaining power of the three groups of variables applying the variation partitioning approach. Detrended Correspondence Analysis was used to evaluate whether important gradients were ignored. It was concluded that the traditional shelterwood uniform system used in Fagus forests has a marked influence on the epiphytic species composition. Thus, management-related variables explained more than one third of the total variation explained, which equals 10.9% of the total variation. Microclimatic and soil variables explained 9.0%, and geographical and geological variables explained 6.0%. The following three recommendations are suggested to reduce the significant influence of management on the epiphytic species composition. First, it should be attempted to ensure a continuous occurrence of some big trees per ha to be left for natural death and decomposition. Second, regular thinning is necessary, especially in the first part of rotation. Third, a multi-layered forest, where wind and desiccation effects are minimized, is recommended."	51	2	0	0	43	1	55	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	27	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12764	10.1111/avsc.12764	Article	JAN 2024	2024	"Questions: Due to their high ecological and agronomical variability, borderland regions offer an excellent opportunity to study assembly patterns. In this study we compared the influence of various factors on summer annual weed communities consisting of both native and introduced species.Location: The borderland region of Austria and Hungary. Methods: We assessed the abundance of weed species in 300 fields of six summer annual crops, and collected information on 26 background variables for each plot. We applied redundancy analysis (RDA) to estimate multivariate species responses and variation partitioning to compare the relative importance of three groups of variables (environmental variables, management variables, and country as a singleton group), and we also checked for statistical association between country and the predictors of the other two groups. Results: The full RDA model explained 22.02% of the variance in weed species composition. Variation partitioning showed that environment and management had similarly high (similar to 8%) influence on weeds, while country had a modest yet substantial (similar to 1%) effect, and there was relatively little overlap between the variance attributable to the three groups. Comparing the individual variables, country ranked third (after preceding crop, and actual crop). The effects of 15 further variables were also significant, including seven management, and seven environmental variables, as well as the location of the sampling plots within the fields. Comparisons between the countries showed that farming type, preceding crops, tillage system, tillage depth and field size were significantly different between the countries. Conclusions: Country exhibited a small but significant influence on weed community composition, which could not be explained with easily accessible management and environmental variables. This suggests that the distinct historical agronomical background of the two countries, possibly involving some legacies of the former Iron Curtain period, still has an impact on the weed species composition of arable fields."	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2024-01-24	WOS:001136872800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

How is resource provision affected by fallow management and landscape structure? Can the resulting variation in the value of fallows to pollinators be explained using the response-and-effect trait framework?Location: Four semi-arid Mediterranean agricultural regions (NE Iberian Peninsula).Methods: Landscape complexity, fallow field age and management practices were identified as the explanatory factors that interact which each other and affect the provision of resource for pollination communities. A trait-based approach was taken to model the system. Plant traits were selected on the basis of their response to abiotic factors (response traits) and those that influence the interaction with pollinators (effect traits). Plant community characterization was calculated based on both taxonomic and functional indices. The linkages between the selected plant traits on contrasting fallows were analysed using community-weighted mean redundancy analysis (CWM-RDA).Results: The presence of semi-natural areas in the landscape was shown to enhance the value of fallows for pollinators, providing a source of diverse flower forms. In contrast, we found that field edges act as a relatively poor reservoir for flowering plant species in these areas. Land-use practices promoting mid-successional plant communities that support the coexistence of diverse life forms with overlapping flowering periods and a range of flower morphologies had the greatest potential to support a diverse pollinator community.Conclusions: Early herbicide application (Feb) combined with shredding were identified as the best fallow practices for enhancing resources for pollinators. The construction of our framework will help policy makers to identify management recommendations that will result in the most beneficial plant communities for pollinators in fallows."	12	3	0	0	11	0	17	2018-12-28	WOS:000430912500011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Plant communities were surveyed along 40-m transects perpendicular to the patch boundary. Each transect was divided in six plots at given distances from patch boundary. Data were collected related to a set of plant community descriptors referring to structure, composition, life history traits and ecological attributes. A novel methodology that relies on the definition of inner plots as relative interior habitat was introduced for assessment of the depth and magnitude of edge influence. DCA was then used to characterize edge communities.ResultsSignificant edge influence on grassland plant communities was limited to the adjacent boundary (<2.5m). For the majority of descriptors, magnitude of edge influence was higher in grasslands adjacent to crops rather than to roads, in sloping rather than flat edges, and in wall-bounded rather than unbounded patches. Plant assemblages dominated by either ruderal species or xerothermic grassland species were, in all cases, associated with unbounded edges, while distinct assemblages were observed in wall-bounded plots according to their different morphology. Wall-bounded sloping edges were characterized by woodland species, whereas their non-sloping analogues were associated with calcareous grassland species.ConclusionsOur findings provide new insights into the influence of anthropogenic boundaries on semi-natural dry grassland by assessing the depth and magnitude of edge influence, as well as the changes in composition of edge plant communities as a function of the combination of boundary attributes. While the method implemented enabled us to address many of the issues experienced in quantification of edge influence in herbaceous communities, it also allowed us to demonstrate the major role of boundary attributes in modulation of edge community patterns."	11	1	0	0	9	0	15	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Is beta-diversity (dissimilarity in plant species composition between two given plots) well explained by environmental differences for both grasslands and forests? Do gradients of environmental factors created by forest edges influence spatial variation in alpha-diversity from edges to grasslands and forests?LocationSemi-natural grasslands and secondary forests (or conifer plantation) around paddy fields in a traditional agricultural landscape, western Japan.MethodsVegetation survey and environmental (soil water content and sunlight) measurements were conducted on 11 transects passing through grassland-forest ecosystems. Spatial variations in plant beta- and alpha-diversity and environmental variables and their relationships were examined.ResultsWe quantitatively demonstrated common positive edge effects on beta-diversity in both grasslands and forests. Our results suggest that among-edge variations in light conditions, which likely depend on edge aspect and forest type, promote high grassland plant beta-diversity in the vicinity of edges. However, the high beta-diversity of forest floor communities in the proximity of edges cannot be explained by this mechanism. Alpha-diversity tended to be lower within grassland plots located around edges than in grassland interiors, while the richness of the forest community increased toward the edge. This alpha-diversity pattern was suggested to be attributable to resource gradients created by the forest edges.ConclusionsAlthough plant alpha-diversity may not be consistently high in the vicinity of edges, beta-diversity in the communities bordering grassland-forest edges will generally be high in the traditional agricultural landscape. Thus, maintenance of environmental heterogeneity among grassland-forest edges in agricultural ecosystems should be prioritized for local biodiversity conservation."	16	2	0	0	14	0	18	2015-07-02	WOS:000356007400014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

The saplings were located in a 2 m x 2 m grid, characterizing their spatial pattern through a nested ANOVA. The spatial pattern of stems was analysed using the L(d) function. To analyse the spatial relationship between stems belonging to different cohorts, the intertype L(rs)(d) function was used. Finally a new function K(rx)) is presented as a method to analyse the relationship between the spatial distribution of stems and the sapling density (a sampled continuous variable).Results: The mother trees show cluster pattern at scales of ca. 12 m - 22 m. leading to a spatial pattern at 14 m - 16 m for the saplings during the regeneration period. At the beginning of the shelter phase, saplings less than 1.30 m in height show spatial repulsion from the old crop at distances above 10 m, whereas taller saplings show repulsion at shorter distances, due to the suppression of sapling development near the mother trees. At the end of the regeneration period, saplings < 1.30 m appear under the last remaining mother tree canopies.Conclusions: In the stands analysed, located at the southern limit of Pinus sylvestris distribution, this species behaves as half-shade tolerant.

A total of 727 plants were monitored over eight years. The results suggest habitat preferences of the studied species that should be considered for their conservation oriented management.

Urban vacant lots are an excellent study system in which to investigate the effects of management in cities: they are ubiquitous in many cities and they experience a range of management, particularly mowing and fencing.Methods We used municipal data to classify infrequent and intensive mowing regimes and assessed presence or absence of fencing in situ. In our sites, these management strategies are independent. We used individual permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) models to assess the effects of these management strategies on plant community composition. We then assessed species richness of plants with various traits using six individual two-way ANOVA models with interaction terms. Our predictor variables included management strategies (mowing intensity and fencing) and three plant traits (growth form [graminoid, forb, or woody], life duration (annual, biennial, or perennial), and biogeographic origin [native or introduced]).Results We found 120 plant species in the vacant lots. Most of these species were perennial, introduced forbs. We found no discernable effects of mowing intensity on plant community composition or richness of plants in the three functional groups. However, when we compared the species found along fences to those in lot interiors, we found significantly different plant communities. Fence line communities had significantly more native and woody species than lot interiors.Conclusions Plant communities differ at very fine spatial scales within an individual vacant lot, and this pattern is related to the presence of fences. Overall, vacant lots support diverse plant communities which can differentially contribute to wildlife habitat depending on management strategy."	11	1	0	0	7	0	13	2020-04-13	WOS:000522603200011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

We also considered the human and pollinator perspective, and the seasonal dynamics of flowering.ResultsClosed-canopy edges of forests and forest core areas contrasted to semi-natural grasslands and grassland surrogates in some indicators of species composition, such as proportion of forbs, but less unequivocally in more specific indicators of service quality. Habitats ranked quite similarly from both a human and pollinator perspective, except the human perspective overstated the compositional and service quality of all open habitats. From a human perspective, forest service quality was downgraded in all three service provision properties in comparison to other habitats, while pollinators would see the strong contrast of forests only in flower size (functional intensity). Only south-exposed close-canopy edges and particularly outer grassy edges of forests somewhat resembled the quality of grassland surrogates for both user groups.ConclusionsThe ecosystem service provision quality of a habitat should be evaluated using a set of functional indicators, considering user group specific perception and phenology.

How do the landscape properties of aggregation index and patch size vary in each of the dominant species groups as a function of stand age?Location: Stands of 7-, 28- and 68-yr-old chaparral, San Diego County, CA, US.Methods: We sampled and estimated above-ground biomass in 8 m x 8 m field plots. Each stand was classified into species groups using high-resolution imagery. After establishing coefficients for the average biomass per area for each species group and stand age using field data, we estimated biomass in 30 random plots in each stand age using the classified map. We also estimated biomass using pooled coefficients (average of the 28- and 68-yr-old biomass per area). We calculated landscape metrics in six 60 m 9 60 m study sites for each stand age.Results: While we found a statistically significant pattern of higher biomass in the older chaparral stands when using age-specific biomass coefficients, there was no statistical difference between the 28- and 68-yr-old stands using the more conservative pooled coefficients. Both approaches revealed a wide range in biomass in all age classes. We were not able to map dead biomass with sufficient accuracy to measure age-related differences, but no differences in the two older stands were obvious in the field. There were no significant differences in landscape metrics between the two older stands, and the differences observed in the younger stand might have been partially due to aspect differences.Conclusions: Our approach of using a combination of field plots and classification of remote sensing imagery is a valuable method for enlarging the effective study area in chaparral, and allowed us to better measure how widely biomass varies across the study area.

In this study, seed germination and seedling emergence in gap and non-gap plots were investigated to explore the role of tree-fall gaps in the natural regeneration of birch forests.Location: Taibai Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China.Methods: A field survey was conducted to reveal the relationship between tree-fall gaps and birch seedlings. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate seed germination and seedling establishment in gap and non-gap plots.Results: In the field survey, occurrence of birch seedlings was correlated with gap size, which confirms that tree-fall gaps play a crucial role in the regeneration of birch forests. However, in the field experiment, seed germination was extremely low in both gap and non-gap plots, and all seedlings died within 60d in a seedling establishment test. The only difference between gap and non-gap plots in the field experiment was that more seeds survived winter in the gap plots than in the non-gap plots. The laboratory experiment helped us understand results of the field experiment. In the seed germination tests, Betula seeds germinated well in light treatments, but very few germinated in darkness, indicating that Betula seeds are photoblastic. No seeds germinated at 15/5 degrees C (day/night temperature regime), demonstrating the reason for lack of germination in the field experiment. The cover of forest litter reduced the seed germination rate. Seeds stored in dry conditions maintained high survival rates after long-term storage at low temperature. However, the survival of imbibed seeds decreased with decreasing storage temperature.Conclusions: Seed germination and seedling establishment of Betula require a dry and light environment. The main regeneration barriers to seed germination and seedling growth in the non-gap plots are chilling injury and lack of light. Tree-fall gaps are better habitats for Betula seed survival and seedling establishment. This indicates that regeneration of birch forest relies on disturbance."	7	1	0	0	3	0	9	2014-12-31	WOS:000345761800008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

(3) Which climatic, demographic and economic variables are predictive of urban tree species composition? Location Continental USA. Methods We investigated patterns of tree species composition in small cities across the continental USA, specifically exploring relationships to surrounding biomes and their accompanying temperature and precipitation regimes, as well as to key demographic and economic variables. We estimated urban tree species composition by surveying tree experts in randomly selected cities that were stratified by minimum temperature (i.e. hardiness zone) and biome, and constrained to similar population sizes. We then used non-metric multidimensional scaling to investigate relationships between urban tree species composition, biome classification, native status, individual climate variables and several anthropogenic factors. Results We found that urban tree communities were consistently related to the surrounding biome, even after controlling for minimum temperatures. These communities could also be predicted by several individual climatic variables (in models that focused solely on the role of climate as well as models that simultaneously considered key anthropogenic factors). In addition, most of these general patterns were still present when we exclusively examined non-native species. We were unable to identify specific climatic and anthropogenic variables of broad importance because the most predictive variables were highly dependent upon the specific analysis. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that, despite substantial human influence, urban tree communities (including their non-native components) are related to the same climate factors that shape wildland plant communities."	34	0	0	0	29	1	37	2013-01-01	WOS:000312159400003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

This study investigated reproductive failure in the rare grass Calamagrostis porteri ssp. insperata (Swallen) C. Greene (Reed bentgrass). Does the management recommendation of high light stimulate clonal growth, flowering, and seed production?Location: Shawnee National Forest, IL, USA, and in a greenhouse and an experimental garden at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA.Methods: Clones obtained from the three known Illinois populations were grown in a glasshouse under experimental light and soil moisture treatments. After 3 years, plants from the high light treatment were planted outside in an experimental garden where the light treatments were maintained for two more years. In the field, vegetative and flowering tiller density, canopy cover, and associated biotic and abiotic variables including abundance of cooccurring plant species were monitored for 5 years. The overhead tree canopy was cleared over a portion of one population.Results: In the glasshouse, plants increased in size under high light and moist soil, and there were size differences among populations. Sixty-six per cent (20 of 30) of the genets flowered when planted outdoors under full sunlight but did not produce seed. In the field, flowering only occurred in Calamagrostis growing in the cleared area, but no seed were produced. The plants in the flowering population were smaller than plants in the other two populations. The herbaceous community associated with Calamagrostis in the open diverged from the communities remaining under the shade.Conclusions: This study highlights the difficulty of managing reproductively challenged rare species. Calamagrostis populations can be managed to enhance clonal growth, but establishment of new populations would require translocation of vegetative material as it is highly unlikely that seed can be obtained."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2009-08-01	WOS:000268571000006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Can we use this species as an indicator for species-rich semi-natural habitats?Location: Flanders. Belgium.Methods: To capture differences in demographic traits and habitat characteristics, both within and between populations, a two-level survey was carried out. Population size and structure of 89 P. vulgaris populations in different types of small landscape elements was recorded in 1999. At plot level, densities of different life stages were determined and these were related to edaphic conditions and vegetation structure and composition.Results: Three different population types were distinguished: (1) dynamic populations. characterized by seedling and juvenile proportions. (2) normal populations with relatively more adults. but with considerable numbers of seedlings and juveniles and (3) senescent populations, mainly consisting of adults. Senescent populations were significantly smaller than populations with a dynamic demo graphic structure. At plot level. comparison of demographic characteristics between different management regimes revealed that recruitment rates and total plant density of P. vulgaris were highest in plots that received a regime that included mowing and clearing of ditch banks whereas densities were lower along forest edges. For these plots. it was shown that nutrient levels were higher. Densities of adults as well as juvenile and seedling densities were negatively correlated with vegetation height.Conclusions: Local disturbance and heterogeneity may mask the relationship between unfavourable conditions and demographic characteristics at population level. but it is clear that in small populations recruitment needs to be lifted to guarantee its persistence. Performance of P. vulgaris in small landscape elements can be a first indication of plant species diversity in small landscape elements."	15	0	0	0	15	0	15	2004-11-01	WOS:000225645800004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

If a member state reclaims an area that is protected by these directives, it has to take compensational measures. When such an area includes saline grasslands that require very specific abiotic conditions, a place with similar conditions must be available to re-establish those grasslands at another location in a sustainable way. This will limit the number and extent of possible sites for compensation. In the conflict between economy and ecology in the Schelde polders, Flanders has chosen to expand the port of Antwerp in the polders at the left Schelde bank and destroy a protected saline grassland site. As a consequence, it has to compensate for this loss. Therefore, we made a detailed study of the hydrology, geology and soil conditions of the endangered saline grassland site. The same was done in four possible compensation sites, all situated in nearby polders. We found that the presence of upwelling groundwater flowing through a saline peat layer is necessary for the occurrence of saline grasslands. Only in one of the four possible compensation sites, called Muggenhoek, we found such conditions. So, we indicate this place as a possible site for the re-creation of saline grasslands and give some recommendations for their development."	6	0	0	0	3	0	7	2003-12-01	BCI:BCI200400251746	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Applied Vegetation Science	NA	28	e70033	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/avsc.70033	Journal article	2025	2025	"Aims: The number of hydropower dams has grown globally over recent decades, with significant impacts on downstream riparian plant communities. Many of these dams generate daily fluctuating flows known as hydropeaking to meet sub-daily variation in energy demands. Hydropeaking can significantly impact riparian plant communities, with obligate riparian species tending to experience the greatest negative effects on habitat suitability. Whether this pattern holds in arid biomes where daily soil moisture enhancements could benefit some plants is an open question. Location: Colorado River, Grand Canyon, Western USA. Methods: We used occurrence records to model species responses to variation in daily flow fluctuations across 32 689 river segments in the Western United States. We then applied estimates of hydropeaking responses derived from those models to understanding the abundance and fine scale hydrologic niches of riparian plant species in the Colorado River ecosystem downstream of Glen Canyon Dam, which has experienced vegetation expansion attributed to river regulation, including hydropeaking that began in 1964. Results: At the regional scale, species with greater wetland dependence exhibited increasingly negative responses to hydropeaking across 1 496 species, consistent with previous studies at smaller scales. At the local scale of the Colorado River, we found that species inhabiting near-channel habitat characterized by daily inundation and exposure had positive modeled responses to hydropeaking, consistent with a long history of selection for species tolerant of hydropeaking. In contrast, species inhabiting the zone immediately above peak daily river stage had negative modeled responses to hydropeaking, suggesting that they are being excluded from otherwise suitable habitat nearer the channel. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that hydropeaking can impact species distributions from local to regional scales by excluding obligate wetland species and reducing habitat suitability for some facultative wetland species. These results from an arid river system are consistent with those reported from other biomes."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-11-11	CABI:20250392960	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Weed species were divided into groups according to their residence time in Central Europe (native species, archaeophytes, neophytes) and nitrogen preference (low to medium, LMNP, and high, HNP species). The percentage of semi-natural habitats was calculated in the 500 m radius circle. Effects of fertilizer use, transect position and semi-natural habitats were estimated by general linear mixed models.Results: We recorded 149 weed species. Fertilizer had a negative impact on the species richness of archaeophytes and LMNP species, and on the cover of native weeds. There was greater species richness and weed cover at the edge of the fields than in the centre. A higher percentage of seminatural habitats around the arable fields resulted in greater total species richness, especially of archaeophytes and LMNP species. We found an interaction between the percentage of semi-natural habitats and transect position for species richness of archaeophytes and LMNP species.Conclusions: Reduced use of fertilizers and a high percentage of semi-natural habitats would support native and archaeophyte weed diversity even in winter cereal fields, while large amounts of fertilizer may promote invasion of neophytes. However, the beneficial effect of the semi-natural habitats and greater species pool on the arable flora may prevail only in the crop edges."	31	0	0	0	32	0	33	2011-02-01	WOS:000286207100005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

The PVC tape discolouration method enables spatially and temporally extensive studies of reductive conditions associated with longterm water table dynamics in peat soils. The reliability of the method has been verified only for ombrotrophic bogs, even though wide usage can be expected in minerotrophic fens. Location: Trebon basin, Czech Republic.Methods: Using data from 49 plots in six poor and moderately rich fens, we correlated the directly measured lowest, highest and mean water table depths and the same variables indicated by discolouration of PVC tape attached to green bamboo stakes installed vertically in the soil profile.Results: The depth to the first sign of PVC discolouration was highly correlated with the directly measured position of the highest water table, the correlation between the depth of complete discolouration and the directly measured position of the lowest water table was poorer. The accuracy of the minimum water table measurement depended on the depth of the peat layer. Surprisingly, the depth at which the green bamboo stakes turned brown correlated highly with the minimum water table.Conclusions: The PVC tape discolouration method reliably indicates water table maxima in fens, but minima are not accurately indicated. The depth of the green bamboo discolouration is suggested as a new alternative indicator of the minimum water table, even in fens and mineral soils. Combining both methods enables efficient monitoring of water table dynamics at a large number of mire sites."	8	1	0	0	7	0	11	2005-05-01	WOS:000232547000004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Once landscape patterns have been quantified, their effects on ecological functions can be explained if the expected pattern in the absence of specific processes is known. This type of expected pattern has been termed a neutral landscape model. In the landscape-ecological literature, researchers traditionally adopt random and fractal computer-generated neutral landscape models to verify the expected relationship between a given ecological process and landscape spatial heterogeneity. Conversely, little attention has been devoted to distribution patterns of potential natural vegetation (PNV) as an ecological baseline for the evaluation of pattern-process interactions at the landscape scale. As an application for demonstration, we propose a neutral model based on PNV as a possible reference for a quantitative comparison with actual vegetation (AC V) distribution. Within this context, we introduce an evenness-like index termed actual-to-potential entropy ratio (HA/P = HACV/HPNV, where H is Shannon's entropy). Results show that, despite the hypothetical character of most PNV maps, the use of PNV distribution as a baseline for a quantitative comparison with ACV distribution may represent a first step towards a general model for the evaluation of the effects of disturbance on vegetation patterns and diversity."	30	1	0	0	19	1	36	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

There is evidence that summer drought causing low fen-water levels induces temporal high P-availability. We investigate here whether and how fen vegetation responds to P-pulses at different times in the season. Plots were fertilized with equal P-doses at three different times in the season. Four conclusions can be drawn from the experiment: 1. The vegetation is able to increase P-uptake independent of the timing of fertilizer application; 2. Early-season fertilization stimulates growth and increases P-concentration in above-ground tissue while late-season fertilization does not stimulate growth but strongly increases above-ground tissue concentration; 3. Timing effects cause differential species responses: the response of Carex demissa, a stress-tolerant species, is truly independent of timing, while Juncus articulatus, a CSR-type species (sensu Grime) profits more from early-season fertilization; 4. Timing effects persist over several years. The differences between the experimental treatment and the events it aimed to simulate are discussed.

Expert-based vegetation indicator systems have been developed to measure and characterize human impacts on vegetation. Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) is a widely used, primarily North American system for assessing degradation and natural quality through species-based values called coefficients of conservatism. The hemeroby and naturalness indicator value (NIV) systems were independently developed for users to assess human impacts in Europe. Despite the similarities among these indicator systems, there is no mutual recognition among them, and they have developed and operate in relative isolation from one another. Approach We review the FQA, hemeroby, and NIV systems to provide a basic summary of the three systems and to evaluate them, highlighting their nearly identical core mechanics and conceptual commonalities. We also compare and contrast the three systems to less integrative ecological indicator systems that can be used to indirectly measure human impact, notably the Ellenberg system. Findings We describe how FQA and naturalness indicator values, in particular, could be considered twin systems. Despite these core similarities, users of these systems do not cite each other, potentially overlooking benefits from applying methods and concepts from separate systems. The FQA, hemeroby, and NIV systems have unique weaknesses, strengths, and primary applications compared to other ecological indicator systems. Conclusions We conclude by discussing the future role and utility of the three specialized human impact indicator systems for scientists and practitioners. Human impact indicator values may be valuable for use in basic research, but arguably their most important applications are in the practice of conservation, such as monitoring restored ecosystems."	14	0	0	0	10	0	17	2020-09-24	WOS:000568603500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Canopy thinning effectively increases understorey diversity in plantation forests. However, the process of understorey community assembly after canopy thinning remains unclear. We compared the relative importance of two mechanisms that could affect the assembly of understorey woody communities after thinning: (1) environmental filtering due to competition from canopy trees, and (2) stochastic immigration. If the latter is dominant, the effectiveness of local treatment might be unpredictable because of the variable probability of immigration at each location.LocationYamagata Prefecture, Japan.MethodsWe censused the understorey tree communities in 18 quadrats (each 1mx1m) in each of 49 stands of Japanese cedar plantations. The mean species richness of the 18 quadrats (alpha-diversity), variation in community composition among them (beta-diversity), deviation of beta-diversity from that of a random community (beta-deviation) and total species richness of the plots (gamma-diversity) were compared among censuses (before thinning, 2 and 5yr after thinning). The relative contributions of two explanatory variables to the various diversities were examined: (1) basal area of canopy trees (overstorey BA, an index of environmental filtering), and (2) available seed source in the surrounding landscape (landscape effect; an index of the probability of immigration).ResultsAlthough neither beta-diversity nor gamma-diversity changed throughout the censuses, the alpha-diversity, stem abundance and beta-deviation were affected by thinning. beta-deviation increased after thinning. Overstorey BA limited alpha- and gamma-diversity throughout the censuses. The landscape effect was more significant in terms of beta-deviation after than before thinning. In addition, the effective scale of the landscape effect increased after thinning.ConclusionOur results indicate that both processes are important: thinning brought about an increase in the relative importance of stochastic immigration as well as a reduction in competitive pressure from canopy trees. These results suggest that while local treatment can increase understorey diversity, stochastic immigration from seed sources is the direct driver after thinning. Although local treatment is effective, its efficiency depends on the seed source availability in the surrounding landscape."	11	0	0	0	7	0	11	2017-10-01	WOS:000412077700014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

How do the diversity and composition of plant communities differ within and between berms, embankments and field margins? What is the influence of management practices on the diversity and composition of plant communities within and between these elements? Considering species frequently occurring in these three elements (hereafter generalist species), do road-field management practices influence their abundance in field margins?LocationCentral-western France.MethodsThree adjacent elements located between district roads and winter cereal fields - i.e. berm, embankment and field margin - were sampled in 40 road-field boundaries situated in an agricultural area. Management practices on each element were characterized (i.e. mowing frequency and/or mowing period, inputs of herbicide and nitrogen fertilizers). We compared species diversity and taxonomic composition within and between elements. We tested the influence of management practices on (i) species richness and species evenness in each element, (ii) abundance-based compositional dissimilarity between pairs of elements using a model averaging procedure, and (iii) abundance of generalist species in field margins using generalized Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.ResultsCompositional dissimilarity between elements was mainly due to changes of dominant species. An early mowing of the berm increased berm species richness, while late mowing increased species richness of adjacent elements. An increase in embankment mowing frequency decreased species evenness in the embankment while input of herbicide on the embankment decreased the substitution rate between embankment and field margin. Finally, late mowing of the berm and one cut of the embankment both increased abundance of some generalist weeds in field margins.ConclusionsIn our agricultural landscape, mowing berms once in early summer is appropriate to promote plant species richness, while late mowing may potentially conflict with integrated weed management in adjacent arable fields. We suggest that programmes managing road verges should take into account the effects on plant assemblages within road verge elements and adjacent arable fields, as well as the potential increase in weed risk."	13	0	0	0	11	0	15	2016-10-01	WOS:000386136600011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

How should environmental variables and spatial patterns be taken into account to conserve the maximum possible beta-diversity within the habitat? Location Central Italy. Methods We used 195 vegetation releves distributed in three nested extents: a single mountain, a mountain chain and southern Lazio. Multiple regression on distance matrices was performed using dissimilarity matrices based on: (1) species abundances as response variables; (2) spatial coordinates and environmental parameters (altitude, slope, percentage of rock and stone coverage, aspect, annual rainfall) as explanatory variables. The two groups of explanatory variables were used separately to partition the variation, and jointly to assess the relative contribution of each individual variable. Those variables found to significantly affect beta-diversity were used to: (1) compare beta-diversity levels between a set of randomly selected and a set of stratified releves; and (2) analyse the habitat distribution across environmental gradients. These analyses, together with the curves describing the relationships between spatial distances and composition dissimilarities, were used to inform management decisions for the habitat. Results Most of the variance was explained by environmental variables, whose share was higher in the smallest and intermediate extent than in the broadest extent. Community dissimilarity increased in proportion to differences in altitude and spatial distances at every extent. Accordingly, at all the extents, the selection of releves stratified by altitude or selected taking into account a minimum spatial distance included significantly higher levels of within-habitat beta-diversity, than randomly selected releves. The relation of beta-diversity to the variation in aspect and annual rainfall varied at different extents. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that dry grassland management plans aimed at conserving the maximum within-habitat beta-diversity should take into account variation in environmental variables, among which altitude proved to be a critical factor at every extent. Also, spatial distances positively affect within-habitat beta-diversity levels, and scale-dependent minimum distances among habitat patches should be taken into account when selecting patches of habitat 6210(*) to be conserved in the study area."	18	1	0	0	20	0	21	2013-07-10	WOS:000319885000006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	15	2	SI	NA	166	174	NA	10.1111/j.1654-109X.2011.01161.x	Article	APR 2012	2012	"Question: Does liming mitigate carbon limitation to the original submerged vegetation of Norwegian softwater lakes?Location: Dybingsvatn (Dalane region, Southern Norway).Methods: Eight plots (1 m 2) were permanently marked in the deeper part (1.5 m) of the littoral zone of Dybingsvatn in 1994. Half of the plots were limed four times with dolocal (1 kgm- 2) in the period 1994-1998. Pore water, surface water chemistry and the occurrence of new plant species were monitored until 2008. In 2008, the composition and cover of the vegetation were estimated and the dominant isoetid plant species were harvested for determination of additional plant characteristics.Results: Liming lowered the redox potential of the sediment and led to higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, Ca 2+, Mg 2+, Fe 2+ and Mn 2+ in the sediment pore water. Submerged macrophytes that could in some way profit from the higher carbon dioxide concentrations developing in the pore water (e. g. Juncus bulbosus, Sparganium angustifolium and Callitriche hamulata) expanded or colonized the limed plots at different time-points. Four years of liming did not affect the cover and composition of the original isoetid vegetation, but led to development of taller and heavier plants with higher molar carbon to nitrogen ratios in the shoots, indicating a higher availability and uptake of carbon dioxide fromthe sediment.Conclusions: Liming leads to a higher availability of carbon dioxide in the sediment, partly owing to dissolution of carbonates, and partly by inducing anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and the consequent reduction of iron (IIII) hydroxides in the iron-rich sediment (in-lake alkalinity generation). All observed changes in the vegetation indicate that liming leads to mitigation of carbon dioxide limitation in Norwegian softwater lakes. Liming may be beneficial for fish populations by reducing concentrations of labile aluminium, but it does not preserve the characteristic chemical sediment properties and original vegetation of softwater lakes. We wish to point out that limingmay, in the worst case, lead to an alternative stable lake state with anaerobic sediments as relatively highly productive isoetid plant species have a risk of uprooting."	10	0	0	0	8	0	10	2012-04-01	WOS:000301047300002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

We selected field margins in consolidated fields of different ages and distances from seed sources. Indicator species for both field types were sought. Regression analysis and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were used to determine the effect of spatial and temporal distances on the species composition of native vegetation.ResultsSpecies richness differed significantly between the margin of traditional and consolidated fields. We identified significant indicator species of traditional fields, but not of consolidated fields. In consolidated fields, species richness increased significantly with age and decreased significantly with increasing distance to the source. At younger sites, species richness decreased faster with distance to the source because of strong negative correlation, but not at older sites. DCA ordination plots similarly indicated that similarities of vegetation composition in consolidated and traditional fields decreased with distance, and the effect of distance decreased with age.ConclusionsThe species composition of the grassland margins of consolidated field was more similar to the margins of traditional fields if the consolidated fields were older, and/or closer to traditional fields. This pattern suggests that dispersal may play a role in the establishment of species on field margins."	23	0	0	0	20	0	25	2010-08-01	WOS:000279438400008	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Annual N- and P-balances were estimated by the sum of all external input and output fluxes: atmospheric deposition, input of dissolved matter by flooding, input of sediment by flooding, input by groundwater, output by leaching, output by hay-making and for N also input by N-2-fixation. For N we also estimated net annual N-availability for plant growth, i.e. the N-budget, which includes net mineralization in soil.Results: The studied wetland sites had a negative balance, which means that nutrients are depleted but only if mown annually, except for the Dutch/Belgian fens which had an equilibrium N-balance and the Polish fen which had an equilibrium P-balance. For the N-budget it appeared that atmospheric deposition added significantly to the budget of Dutch/ Belgian fens and N-mineralization added significantly to fen and floodplain budgets, except for the Polish fens. Mineralization dominates the N-budget of the western European floodplains. Hay-making is the most important output pathway, particularly if practised annually. It seems to diminish N-enrichment in the Dutch fens and floodplains.Conclusions: We conclude that western European fens and floodplains as well as Polish floodplains have a significant positive N-budget indicating that there is a surplus of N for plant growth. In the Polish fens this is less due to low atmospheric deposition and lower N-mineralization rates. The latter is associated with less drying out of the studied Polish ecosystems in summer. Our approach, although an approximate quantification, is helpful for assessing priorities focused on nutrient management."	48	2	0	0	41	0	54	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

We produced three types of environment with respect to herb competition: absence of competition (AC), below-ground competition (BGC), and total competition (TC). We assessed the performance of Q.faginea seedlings in each treatment in five ways: (1) seedling mortality, (2) leaf length and total plant leaf area, (3) water potential, (4) total biomass and biomass allocation, and (5) non-structural carbohydrate storage in different plant organs. We also measured (6) soil moisture at different depths and (7) biomass production of herbs. The TC treatment reduced water availability more than the BGC treatment, in agreement with the most pronounced water stress in seedlings under TC conditions. BGC and TC treatments showed a high and similar seedling mortality, which was one order of magnitude higher than that in the AC treatment. Competition treatments affected glucose concentration in both shoots and roots, and followed the rank TC > BGC > AC. Q. faginea seedlings might compensate a lower water availability through glucose accumulation in leaves to reduce the osmotic potential. There was a maximum starch concentration in the BGC treatment that hints that a moderate resource limitation would limit tissue growth but not carbon assimilation. We conclude that the negative effects of herbs on Q. faginea seedlings are mostly a result of competition for water, and that this competition is noticeable since the earliest stages of the establishment. Complete weed removal is a technique that would strongly improve seedling survivorship."	33	3	0	0	28	0	39	2003-12-01	WOS:000220133300014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Spatial analysis provides useful evidence on the significance, scale and shape of patterns for disease diagnosis. This study explores the causes of dieback through spatial analysis of tree health at Coranderrk Reserve, an example of an important conservation reserve on the urban fringe of Melbourne, Victoria. Ca. 200 trees were sampled at two sites and measured for position, diameter and height in each of two different community types. An index of tree health was developed, and each tree was assigned a value of health. Dead trees were categorized based on state of decay. Correlograms using Moran's I found significant spatial stucture at both study sites. The study employed a method of analysis that compares the spatial patterns in dead and living trees. When all dead trees were eliminated from the analysis, significant spatial pattern was found only at one site, The spatial structures obtained were compared with those expected from the different possible causes of tree dieback. Some potential explanations were eliminated. The results illustrate how spatial analysis may make useful contributions to disease diagnosis if employed systematically together with other modes of investigation."	9	0	0	0	5	0	12	2001-12-01	WOS:000174291000011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

However, whether and how shifts in plant-plant interactions along the facilitation-competition continuum alter revegetation success has been seldom considered. To test whether and how shifts in plant-plant interactions (due to woody species identity, study site, early life stage, and individual nurse) might alter plant recruitment and thus the success of revegetation projects, we chose a system comprising the Mediterranean dwarf palm (Chamaerops humilis) and seven common woody plant species. Location Two human-degraded sites within Donana National Park (southwestern Spain). Methods We carried out several well-replicated field experiments to compare plant performance (seed survival, seedling emergence, seedling survival, seedling recruitment) in the presence and absence of Chamaerops humilis. Results Chamaerops humilis had marked effects on the performance of woody species that, however, changed among life stages. Depending on woody species identity, seed survival was up to 193 times greater in adjacent open spaces than beneath Chamaerops humilis. Conversely, seedling survival and recruitment were up to 19 times greater beneath Chamaerops humilis than in open spaces. Importantly, none of the studied woody species showed greater accumulated recruitment in open spaces than beneath Chamaerops humilis. Interestingly, we found strong inter-individual palm variation in the sign and strength of their effect on woody plant performance. Conclusions We found strong seed-seedling conflicts the strength of which was species-specific. The strong inter-individual palm variation depicts a facilitation-competition continuum with important implications for restoration. We propose several management recommendations across different hierarchical levels (i.e., from individuals to communities) that may increase plant recruitment and therefore the success of revegetation projects. Our results are particularly relevant for restoring arid, semi-arid and alpine landscapes worldwide where the nurse-beneficiary plant interactions are critical to ameliorating stressful conditions."	6	0	0	0	5	0	7	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000004	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Methods We used a UV-LED light and a mirrorless camera with a filter, which represents a low-cost equipment for narrow emission/reflection photography (350-380 nm). Flowers were photographed with two standards of known reflection, and UV reflectance values were obtained using open-source image processing software. We measured UV reflectance for 57 plant species typical of European semi-natural grasslands. Results Our values substantially matched the categorical classes obtained by analogue photography available in TRY and showed a highly significant relationship with spectrophotometric measures. Conclusions The method proposed here overcomes the one based on analogue photography and subjective visual estimates, and represents an easy and low-cost alternative to spectrophotometry.

Which are the effects of wild boar disturbance? How do the responses of specialist or non-specialist species of the habitat differ?LocationNW Sardinia Island (Italy).MethodsWe assessed plant cover during six years within one 60 cm x 60 cm quadrat in each of five areas. To measure the effect of inter-annual meteorological fluctuations on vegetation, we used two indices: the evapotranspiration and the synthetic agrometeorological indicator. To quantify the effect of disturbance by boars, we compared two treatments: disturbed and non-disturbed (located outside and inside 1.5 m x 1.5 m exclosures respectively). As a whole, we monitored 60 plots (6 years x 2 treatments x 5 replications). We analyzed data using ANOVA, PERMANOVA and BIO-ENV.ResultsPlant species richness and composition showed significant differences between years and treatments. Species composition was correlated with the evapotranspiration before the vegetative peak during the last period and with the agrometeorological indicator during the whole vegetative period. Specialist species showed much weaker growth, quantified as cover, in the drier years. Starting from the third survey year, plant richness and cover of specialist species were significantly higher in disturbed than in not-disturbed plots. The extent of bare soil generally was not affected by the treatment.ConclusionsMeteorological fluctuations affect plant species composition and vegetation dynamics in Mediterranean temporary ponds. The sensitivity of specialist species could make them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Nevertheless, they are resilient to unpredictable disturbances such as burrowing by wild boar. However, our results concerning the positive impact of wild boar disturbance on the vegetation cannot be generalized. Elsewhere, the lack of hunting activity could also be a problem for these habitats."	7	0	0	0	5	0	8	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Location Warm-temperate forests in Boso Peninsula, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Methods We designed a factorial experiment including two levels of forest canopy treatment (clear-cutting or intact canopy) and two levels of herbivory control (presence or absence of deer) using 24 plots of 10 m x 10 m. Vegetation dynamics occurring under each experimental treatment were tracked for 7.5 years. Results Ground vegetation under the closed canopy did not change significantly for 7.5 years both inside and outside the deer fences. However, plots were rapidly covered by early-seral plants till 1.5 years after the cutting event. The quick growth of ground vegetation after clear-cutting was supported by plants that are known to have soil seed banks, as suggested by their ubiquity immediately after clear-cutting. Species richness of ground vegetation was maximized at that time and gradually decreased afterward, suggesting biological filtering. This filtering process worked differently inside and outside the deer fences, resulting in different types of vegetation. The clear-cut-and-fence plots became dominated by tree recruits that will recover secondary forests in the future. Contrastingly, vegetation outside the fences lacked many species (e.g., common tree species) that were found inside the fences and became dominated by shrubs and plants unpalatable to deer. This post-cutting vegetation outside the fences was not similar to that inside the deer fences at any seral stage. This means that the vegetation outside the fences could be tracking an alternative successional trajectory rather than a case of arrested succession. Conclusions Here, abandoned secondary forests still seem to maintain a high regeneration potential that would be triggered by clear-cutting, but reducing herbivory pressure by deer is necessary to avoid the risk of alternative successional trajectories."	17	0	0	0	13	0	18	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Therefore, soil seed banks can reflect the effects of long-term cumulative field management and crop sequences on weed communities. Moreover, soil seed banks provide strong estimates of future weed problems but also of potential arable plant diversity and associated ecological functions. For this, we evaluated the effects of different long-term farming systems under the same crop rotation sequence on the abundance, diversity and community assembly of weed seed bank, as well as on the functional diversity and composition.Location: DOK (biodynamic [D], bioorganic [O], conventional [K]) long-term trial, Therwil, Switzerland.Methods: The effects of long-term contrasted farming systems (i.e., biodynamic, organic, conventional, mineral and unfertilised systems) and last crop sown (i.e., wheat and maize) were evaluated on different indicators of species and functional diversity and composition of the weed soil seed bank.Results: The results showed significant influences of 40 years of contrasted farming systems on the diversity and composition of the seed bank, with higher diversities being found in unfertilised and organic farming systems, but also higher abundances than those found under conventional systems. Organic farming also allowed higher functional richness, dispersion and redundancy. Different farming systems triggered shifts in species and functional assemblies.Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of organic management for the maintenance of a diverse arable plant community and its functions. However, such results emphasise the need for appropriate yearly management to reduce the abundance of settled weediness and prevent affecting crop production. The farm management filtered community composition based on functional traits. Although the soil seed bank buffers the long-term farming and crop sequence, the last crop sown and, thus, the yearly management were important determinants of seed bank composition."	14	0	0	0	12	0	16	2020-05-23	WOS:000534789800001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Two forest patches were selected according to management regimes (active coppicing, 1-40 yrs; abandoned coppicing, >40 yrs) in each of the two study areas (Bolognola and Ussita). Within each forest patch, 20 stands were sampled in 20 m 9 20 m plots, for a total of 80 sampling units.Results: We found that the height of standards and number of dominant trees were negatively correlated with the total number of species. At the plot scale, the number of beech specialist species was significantly higher in abandoned plots. At the forest patch scale, the number of species in Bolognola was markedly higher in the actively coppiced forest than in the abandoned one, while the opposite result was found at Ussita. Regarding the beech specialist species richness, the abandoned forest at Ussita showed higher richness than the coppiced forest, while in Bolognola we found the opposite. The managed forest hosted more overstorey species than the abandoned one in both areas. Surprisingly, at forest patch scale in Bolognola, the total beech specialist species richness was higher in the coppiced plots than in the abandoned ones. The species assemblages were more similar between patches having different management regimes within the same area, than between patches having the same management regime across different areas.Conclusions: This material provides a novel contribution to the study of species diversity patterns in this forest system, suggesting the importance of a multiple scale approach in forest diversity studies. The beech specialist species can largely persist in a heterogeneous coppice landscape, where abandoned stands are mixed with stands under regular coppicing. The results can link current knowledge about beech coppice diversity on the landscape scale with that on the plot scale, and thus help guide new conservation planning."	27	1	0	0	23	1	30	2016-07-01	WOS:000384751300011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

We compared shrubland plots with varying cover of Hippophae with neighbouring dune grassland plots without shrubs as reference sites. Soil samples were collected to determine the values of some important edaphic variables (pH, organic matter, nitrogen).Results: The shrubland plots with Hippophae had or tended to hive lower soil pH and ON ratios and higher contents of organic matter and nitrogen than the grassland plots. Total species richness was marginally significantly related to the cover of Hippophae in a hump-backed manner on both islands. The pattern was more pronounced for mosses and lichens than for herbaceous species. For all species groups on Spiekeroog and for he herbaceous species on Norderney, the hump-backed relationship was much improved when using the difference in species number between shrubland and grassland plot as a dependent variable. Relationships could be improved by including the soil parameters as co-variables. Species richness was highest at moderate levels of shrub expansion, while it was much reduced in very dense shrubland. The decrease in species number is caused by the decline in grassland species typical of the open dunes, including some rare taxa.Conclusions: The expansion of Hippophae rhamnoides is a serious threat to the plant species richness of open coastal dunes, and needs to be counteracted by management measures."	39	0	0	0	35	0	48	2007-04-01	WOS:000245934700005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Agronomists, decision-makers and the public generally assume that this agricultural sustainability implies the maintenance of species diversity. However, this assumption often does not hold true. This is shown in a case study of moderately ferti-lized Arrhenatheretum meadows in northern Switzerland. Earlier and more frequent mowing, simultaneous harvesting of all the grasslands in a region, and ecological changes in surrounding arable fields, hedges and other ecosystems often cause a decline in plant and animal species richness, while agricultural yield does not noticeably change. To emphasize the distinction the concept of biocenotic sustainability is proposed for describing the capability of a community to maintain its species composition and structure. For maintaining or attaining biocenotic sustainability. results of modern ecology have to be taken into account, e.g. the theories of island biogeography, minimum viable populations, dispersal, and metapopulations.

Plant taxa were categorized by growth habit and life form to aid interpretation of multivariate analyses used to illustrate differences in ground flora assemblages between disturbance categories.Results Prescribed fire reduced ground flora cover, but not diversity, which remained greatest in wind-disturbed sites that were not salvage-logged. Though ground flora assemblages remained disparate between disturbance categories, prescribed fire imposed some consistent selective pressures on plants with common life-history strategies. Post-fire understorey tree cover reductions coincided with increased shrub cover throughout the treatment area. Nonetheless, differences in graminoid cover were exaggerated after prescribed fire, and representation of the geophyte life form was relatively constant across space and time.Conclusions Prescribed fire did not counteract salvage-mediated reductions in ground flora diversity. Retention of downed deadwood maximized early-successional plant diversity in wind-disturbed sites. Trait-based ground flora analyses enabled a more detailed understanding of disturbance effects than aggregate metrics of foliar cover and diversity. In ecosystems with high floristic diversity, grouping plants by common life-history traits can provide a simple and effective means to monitor impacts of management actions on ecosystem recovery."	3	0	0	0	3	0	4	2020-12-01	WOS:000590294300001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

E. crus-galli deserves particular attention due to its tendency to develop herbicide resistance and its positive reaction to dense maize cropping patterns."	16	0	0	0	12	0	17	2018-09-04	WOS:000442660900008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Location Platte River Valley region of south-central Nebraska, USA. Methods We imposed severe drought for one growing season using rainfall manipulation structures and measured the response of above- and below-ground plant communities (ramet and below-ground bud densities) with respect to non-drought controls during the drought year and a recovery year. Results Drought reduced below-ground bud bank density and above-ground stem density. However, bud bank density recovered, and bud production was higher on previously droughted subplots relative to controls in the year following drought. The response of below-ground bud and above-ground stem density to drought differed according to functional identity (C3 grass, C4 grass, and forb), with forbs least resistant to, but having the greatest recovery from, drought. Conclusions While overall density in restored grasslands was resilient, drought effects on below-ground bud banks may have longer-term impacts on plant community structure. Reduced density above- or below-ground during the growing season following drought may allow for the persistence of species relatively more reliant on recruitment from seed banks in favourable micro-sites."	35	6	0	0	34	1	47	2012-10-01	WOS:000308373500003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Boundary types were a combination of adjacent land cover, orientation and topography classes. Response patterns to edge influence of two vegetation descriptors, species richness and composition (summarized by an ordination), were analysed using the two-phase linear regression method . Data for each transect were divided into all possible pairs of adjacent groups of successive plots, and a linear regression was computed on both groups of plots. Regression parameters were interpreted by comparison with the two-zone theoretical pattern and related to boundary types.ResultsWe have shown for nearly half of the transects that vegetation responses deviate from the two-zone pattern. There was no significant relationship between regression coefficients for richness and boundary characteristics whereas regression coefficients for composition were partly related to adjacent land cover.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate a high variability of forest vegetation response patterns to edge that contrasts with the theoretical pattern usually reported in the literature.

Central point: 35 degrees 15'S, 57 degrees 45'W.Methods: We used a 19-year series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from NOAA-AVHRR PAL (Pathfinder AVHRR Land) images and meteorological data provided by a nearby weather station. The NDVI was used as surrogate of canopy photosynthetic status. The relationship between annually integrated NDVI and meteorological conditions was explored by stepwise multiple regressions for each defined unit. PCA was performed to compare units and growing seasons on a multivariate basis.Results: Mean seasonal NDVI curve was similarly shaped among landscapes. However, the absolute values differed widely. There was high interannual variation so that the mean C seasonal pattern was seldom observed in any particular year. Annually integrated NDVI of all landscapes was negatively associated with summer temperature and positively with previous year precipitation. It was also directly related with current year winter precipitation in two landscapes and with summer precipitation in the others. NDVI response to September and March precipitation accounted for some of the differences in interannual variation among landscapes.Conclusions: Our results revealed a strong intra-regional variation of canopy dynamics, closely linked to landscape (vegetation-soil) and water availability (mainly in summer and during the previous year).

Three of the communities had an N:P ratio of 14 or less, indicating N-limitation; the most fertile grassland community had particularly low values for the N:P ratio (6-12), as did a majority of the species, including all tall-herb species. A species-rich community of fen-margin vegetation in the lowest productive rich fen, had an N:P ratio of 17-19 in the above-ground biomass, which indicates P-limitation of nutrients.

Specifically, we aim to understand (1) the spatial distribution of woody plant biodiversity (species richness, phylogenetic richness, and functional richness) and agricultural revenue (from temporary and permanent crops), (2) the potential synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity, agricultural revenue, and socioeconomic metrics, and (3) how associations between biodiversity and agricultural revenue may shift under projected climate scenarios by 2040. Our findings provide decision-makers with insights to balance biodiversity conservation with agricultural sustainability, offering a framework applicable to similar regions globally.Location Santa Catarina, Brazil.Methods We used machine learning ensemble models to predict woody plant biodiversity and agricultural revenue based on climate, topography, soil, and spatial structure. Biodiversity data were compiled from 480 forest inventory plots (4000 m2 each), while socioeconomic indicators and agricultural production data were obtained from governmental databases. Soil and environmental data were sourced from open-access global databases.Results Temperature, precipitation, and topography were primary predictors of biodiversity, highlighting climate and terrain influences on species richness. In contrast, spatial structure emerged as the main predictor of crop revenue, emphasizing the role of local infrastructure and biophysical factors in agriculture. Projections for 2040 indicate stable biodiversity levels in most municipalities, with localized shifts in biodiversity and crop yields driven by climate-induced changes. Our findings reveal synergies between biodiversity and agricultural revenue but also underscore trade-offs, particularly between permanent crop revenue and forested area.Conclusions Our results support prioritizing conservation efforts in regions projected to maintain or increase biodiversity while promoting climate-smart agriculture for sustainable production. This framework, adaptable to other biodiverse, agriculturally reliant regions, provides a tool for policymakers to balance biodiversity conservation with sustainable agricultural practices under shifting climate conditions."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-11-30	WOS:001624362400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

If not, how can research methods be streamlined and standardized to produce more consistent results and reliable conclusions? Methods We present a review of vegetation-focused climbing-impact studies written in English. We compare study design and climbing-specific considerations in 19 studies and report the impact of rock climbing on richness and abundance of lichens, bryophytes, and vascular plants. We then propose a set of best practices to guide design of future studies. Results Our work reveals that existing studies have employed widely differing methods for data collection and analysis. The effects of climbing on vegetation also varied among studies. Standardizing methods, such as pairing climbed and unclimbed transects or including a metric for climbing use, will generate more reliable and useful conclusions about the effect of climbing on vegetation.

(3) What are the main ecological mechanisms explaining variation in AGB through joint effects of stand density, species diversity and individual tree size variation along an elevational gradient in tropical forests? We hypothesized that higher stand packing, and diverse and complex stand structure drive higher AGB along a local-scale elevational gradient in tropical forests. Location Western Nepal. Methods We analyzed biophysical tree data from 101 tropical forest plots along an elevational gradient ranging from 218 to 1,850 m above sea level. Structural equation models were applied to test the relationships among elevation, stand density, species diversity facet (either species richness, evenness, Shannon diversity or Simpson's dominance), tree diameter and height variation, and AGB. Results Stand density increased but species diversity declined AGB, whereas tree diameter and height variation did not strongly influence AGB. The indirect effects of stand density, species diversity facet, and tree diameter and height variation on AGB via each other were non-significant. Elevation reduced stand density, species richness and AGB but increased tree height variation, and hence, the indirect effects of elevation on AGB were variable. These results suggest that competitive exclusion or selection or environmental filtering effects are shaping the species diversity, structural complexity and AGB of the studied tropical forests. Conclusions We argue that compact stand density, rather than diversity and individual tree size variation, of co-existing species is important for higher AGB but higher species diversity and stand structural complexity may need to be considered in the context of biodiversity conservation and forest management."	9	4	0	0	9	0	12	2021-04-01	WOS:000667075000007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

This threatens the numerous taxa that are dependent on old aspens, including many epiphytic lichens. Potential methods to aid epiphytic lichens on aspen are centered around treatments which affect the density of Norway spruce (Picea abies). In this study, we investigated how epiphytic lichen communities on aspen are affected by the variation of spruce density in the immediate vicinity of the focal aspen. Location Southern boreal forests in Finland. Methods We recorded the occurrence of lichens from 120 aspens in 12 semi-natural forest sites. We used spruce basal area as the measure for spruce density. The selected aspens represented a gradient in spruce basal area in the vicinity of the aspen from 0 to 36 m(2)/ha. We also measured other tree- and stand-level variables that are known to influence lichen occurrence. Results Lichen communities on aspen were affected by spruce density, stand age and bark pH. Both lichen species richness and the richness of red-listed species were highest at an intermediate spruce density, and both increased with stand age. Lichen species richness was higher when bark pH was lower. Additionally, community composition was influenced the most by spruce density, followed by bark pH. Conclusions Our study highlights the detrimental effects of high spruce density on lichen diversity on aspens. This is caused by high spruce density resulting in low light availability. Lichen diversity on aspens was highest when spruce density was intermediate. Spruce thinning in aspen-rich old-growth forests can be helpful in ensuring the long-term persistence of old-growth lichens on aspen in protected forests."	4	0	0	0	4	0	5	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000021	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Several studies have examined the differences between managed and unmanaged reed beds without taking into account the time passed since the last management. In this paper, we seek to answer the question: how does the time passed since last management and the management method itself affect the plant community and the habitat structure of reed beds? Location De ostlige Vejler, Northern Jutland, Denmark. Methods We examined four reed bed treatments - beds either cut or harvested during the year of the study (0-year-old reed beds) and reed beds harvested 3 and 25 years ago, respectively. The reed bed plant communities and the reed bed habitat structure were determined in May and August. We tested the data for overall between-treatment differences (multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA] and principal components analysis [PCA]) and specific differences in the plant community and habitat structure (Kruskal-Wallis). Results The plant community differed significantly between the four reed beds according to treatment, and each reed bed exhibited unique species. Species richness was significantly higher in the recently harvested reed beds (0 and 3 years since harvest) compared with the 25-year-old reed beds. Harvest sparked reed rejuvenation and increased the growth of new reeds. The 3-year-old reed bed had a habitat structure that equally resembled that of the newly harvested (e.g., similar green reed shoot density) and the 25-year-old reed beds (e.g., similar height). Cutting, as opposed to harvesting, created a plant community adapted to less light availability. Conclusions To secure most plant species and most variation in habitat structure, reed beds should contain a mosaic of differently aged and differently managed patches. Previous studies have disagreed on the effect of management on plant species diversity, which could be explained either by different reed bed age or different sampling periods."	6	0	0	0	6	0	6	2020-10-27	WOS:000577705100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Methods In 2013, between June and October, 16,500 pieces of turf blocks from three communities, each 80 x 120 cm in size and 40-50 cm deep, were transferred from a donor site to newly constructed artificial basins. Temporal changes of species composition were observed in 163 permanent plots 2 x 2 m from 2013 to 2016. To analyse compositional changes, we carried out constrained ordination with time as explanatory variable. For changes in species richness, diversity, herb and shrub layers, contribution of woody species, diagnostic taxa, archaeophytes, neophytes, native expansive taxa and ruderal plants, a one-way ANOVA was applied. Results We found that only 35%-39% of species had a positive correlation with time. The total number of species significantly decreased only within the meadow plots. The fen and heath only experienced a slight decrease in species number. Significant changes in abundance of diagnostic species were observed in all plant communities. The abundances of diagnostic taxa were maintained during the first 2 year, then dropped considerably. The highest decrease was noted in the heathland community. Conclusions Turf translocation appeared to be only partially effective as a compensatory measure. Four years after the translocation, the three different habitats still maintained their specific structural features, however the number of diagnostic taxa considerably decreased, particularly in the heathland and the wet meadow. Given the high financial and logistical effort required, translocation measures are questionable and should only be applied as an exceptional last resort method."	12	0	0	0	10	0	12	2019-03-11	WOS:000459825800002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

We used randomization tests to assess the magnitude and distance of edge influence, and to compare edge influence between different edge ages.Results: Black spruce forest next to the 16-17-yr-old cut edges was structurally and compositionally very similar to interior forest, with little edge influence from harvesting beyond 5 m into the forest. Edge influence on the understorey was weak (low magnitude) and not very extensive (short distance) at these edges, with no significant edge influence on the abundance of individual species. Logs peaked in abundance on the forest side of the edge, with values higher than in either adjacent ecosystem.Conclusions: Overall, 16-17-yr-old cut edges in black spruce forest showed little evidence of further structural change compared to the 2-5-yr-old cut edges. Structural development of these edges as well as regeneration of the disturbed areas also resulted in reduced edge influence on the understorey.

Is there a threshold at any of the life-history stages during roadcut primary colonization?Location: A very steep, sun-exposed, low-fertility and low water retention roadcut in a Mediterranean continental site in Madrid, central Spain.Methods: We tracked density of individuals, plant cover, species richness and community composition throughout the sequential process of primary colonization of a newly-exposed roadcut surface. We monitored from seed arrival to seedling emergence, seedling survival and plant growth across species over two growing seasons. We manipulated the intensity of environmental filters in 12 experimental plots (10 x 8 m) following a full-factorial design of two treatments (topsoil spreading and shallow tillage).Results: The response to environmental filter manipulation varied throughout the individual life cycle. Under an equal seed rain, the higher carrying capacity caused by topsoil spreading gave rise to the emergence of a larger number of species, which either persisted or occasionally appeared in some of the stages of the early community assembly. Further, topsoil spreading enhanced seedling survival across species, as well as subsequent plant growth. We therefore detected two life-history stages acting as thresholds in plant community assembly due to an ontogenetic niche shift across species. The first, at seedling emergence, in response to environmental cues with lasting consequences in community composition and species richness; and the second, at the transition to the adult stage in response to local resource availability, with consequences in subsequent plant growth and community cover.Conclusions: During primary colonization, ontogenetic development of pioneers was paralleled by the action of environmental filters throughout the community assembly process. On roadcuts, the confluence of both processes gives rise to a community ontogeny marked by two thresholds determining community richness and cover under Mediterranean conditions. Our findings shed light on the underlying mechanisms involved in technical solutions, such as topsoil spreading, and provide a more efficient approach to roadside restoration."	4	1	0	0	3	0	5	2014-07-16	WOS:000337725300012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Revising Ellenberg's indicator values for continentality based on global vascular plant species distribution	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	20	3	NA	NA	482	493	NA	10.1111/avsc.12306	Article	JUL 2017	2017	"QuestionsMisunderstandings and methodological inconsistencies have hampered the applicability of Ellenberg's biogeographic indicator values for continentality. To redefine the indicator values we focused on the following questions: (1) what is meant by phytogeographic continentality as the basic principle behind Ellenberg's indicator values for continentality; (2) can we redefine the continentality indicator values based on an assessment protocol rendering the values more reproducible; and (3) what are the differences between Ellenberg's indicator values for continentality and the redefined ones as a statistical data set, and in application?LocationNorthern Hemisphere, Central Europe.MethodsBiogeographic indicator values are based on global species distribution data. Species' distribution information is converted to standardized range formulas that combine information on occurrence across floristic zones, altitudinal preferences and the distribution within the oceanity-continentality gradient. Improved and revised range formulas are converted to new indicator values for continentality (C-value) using simple algorithms.ResultsNew indicator values for continentality (C-values) and amplitudes for 2984 taxa of Central European vascular plants are presented. The main improvement is the application of a comprehensible assessment protocol. The new C-value gained a more balanced frequency distribution, rendering it more useful for broad-scale biogeographic analysis.ConclusionsFor the first time, biogeographic indicator values derived with a consistent method that is based on distribution data are presented. Occurrence information and vegetation data are becoming increasingly available globally, while changing climatic conditions inevitably accelerate species range dynamics, and therefore the application of biogeographic indicator values will increase."	47	0	0	0	38	0	51	2017-07-01	WOS:000403676000016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

How does the encroachment of a woody shrub affect herbaceous community structure and species composition in grasslands of a wetland ecosystem?Location: Seasonally flooded grasslands in a Neotropical Hyperseasonal Savanna, the Pantanal wetland, Brazil.Methods: We investigated the effect of the encroaching plant Combretum laxum on a herbaceous community from seasonally flooded grasslands in the Pantanal wetland using 29 vegetation samples representing encroachment at different spatio-temporal stages. The point quadrat method was used to acquire vegetation data, as plant cover, species richness (S) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'). We evaluated the existence of stages of encroachment related to differences in vegetation structure and species composition using non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and analysis of similarity. The response of the herbaceous community to shrub advance was analysed using linear and quadratic polynomial regression models. Model fitness was tested using the ACI.Results: The advance of the woody encroaching plant C. laxum over the seasonally flooded grassland occurs in three stages: grassland stage, shrub islands stage and shrubland stage. The initial advance of C. laxum over the grassland, represented by the shrub islands stage was correlated to an increase in species richness and a decrease in important native forage grasses. Critical changes in the herbaceous community were observed when the encroaching plant covered > 30% of the periodically flooded grassland, when the richness of herbaceous species dropped from 22 to four.Conclusions: Woody encroachment causes impoverishment and simplification of the herbaceous community. The shift from a grass-to a shrub-dominated state is related to the reduction in important grassland-obligate species, forage resources for herbivore livestock and wild animals, affecting the ecological dynamics and the economy of rangelands. Conservation of these grassland ecosystems depends on rangeland management practices guided by scientific knowledge on the causes and consequences of plant community changes."	47	2	0	0	40	1	56	2016-07-01	WOS:000384751300004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Do management treatments achieve general restoration targets for longleaf pine ecosystem structure?Location: Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, NC, USA within the Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain Ecoregion.Methods: Four levels of timber harvest were applied to loblolly pine stands: Control (uncut, basal area similar to 16.2 m(2).ha(-1)), MedBA (residual basal area similar to 9.0 m(2).ha(-1)), LowBA (residual basal area similar to 6.4 m(2).ha(-1)) and Clearcut (residual basal area of 0 m(2).ha(-1)). Within each canopy treatment, we applied three cultural treatments selected to facilitate longleaf pine seedling success: NT (untreated), H (chemical control of woody vegetation) and H + F (chemical control plus fertilization). Vegetation responses, including the abundance (cover) of ground layer vegetation and midstorey stem densities, were reported for three growing seasons (2008-2010) following canopy removal.Results: The ground layer was dominated by woody vegetation, and total vegetation cover generally increased with increasing canopy removal. Canopy treatment effects varied through time. Clearcut plots had higher total herbaceous and graminoid cover than MedBA and Control plots in 2008, while woody cover was significantly lower on Control plots than on LowBA and Clearcut plots in 2009. Clearcut plots had higher densities of loblolly pines than Control plots in 2009 and 2010. The herbicide treatment reduced hardwood densities, but increased loblolly pine densities, especially in 2010.Conclusions: Successful restoration prescriptions are often site-specific because of different land-use history, climate, site characteristics and starting conditions. To achieve the restoration objective of creating an open midstorey with an herbaceous-dominated ground layer when converting loblolly pine stands to longleaf pine dominance on relatively productive sites with abundant hard woods and aggressive loblolly pine natural regeneration, canopy retention can slow the rate of development of loblolly pine regeneration and herbicides reduce hardwood stem densities. Frequent, repeated burning would likely be required to further reduce woody vegetation and increase the relative abundance of herbaceous vegetation."	3	0	0	0	1	0	4	2016-06-01	WOS:000374545600012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

What is the role of seasonal timing of tree litter removal on understorey plants?LocationPodyji National Park, Czech Republic.MethodsWe conducted an experiment in a randomized complete block design of 45 plots (5x5m). Each block (N=15) consisted of one plot for each of the three treatments. Treatments consisted of (1) tree litter removal during spring, (2) tree litter removal during autumn, or (3) no litter removal as control treatment. These treatments were repeated over 4yr. In each plot we recorded the understorey plant species composition and collected soil samples prior to treatment (year 0) and in each subsequent year (years 1-4). Temporal trends in species richness were analysed using repeated measures ANOVAs. The impact of the treatments on vegetation composition over time was analysed using principal response curves.ResultsTotal species richness per plot significantly changed over time, but this was not related to treatment. Annual species richness increased significantly, but only for the autumn treatment. Annual species also showed the highest inter-annual variation. Endangered species were not affected. When compared to the control treatment, the effect of autumn raking on species composition was stronger than the effect of spring raking. Although the amount of removed nutrients substantially exceeded ambient nitrogen input, no changes in soil conditions were detected.ConclusionsThe season in which tree litter removal took place had a small but significant impact on the understorey vegetation, in particular affecting the germination and establishment of annual species. The large inter-annual variation in species richness calls for a long-term field experiment. The removal of nutrients via litter raking greatly exceeds atmospheric nutrient deposition, warranting a further investigation of litter raking as a potential tool for forest conservation."	20	3	0	0	15	0	26	2015-09-30	WOS:000361181500004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

In contrast, Red Lists of ecosystems, habitats or plant community types have only recently found interest at the global level, although they have a longer tradition in Central Europe. We contribute to the debate by presenting and discussing a comprehensive conservation assessment methodology for plant communities that was developed within the framework of the project 'The plant communities of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and their vulnerability'.Location: Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Northeast Germany (23,174 km(2)).Approach: Our approach adopts various concepts from modern red listing and prioritization at various organizational levels of biodiversity, and combines them into a methodological framework applicable for regional to continental Red Lists of plant communities. For each distinguished plant community, three steps are carried out, i.e. (1) assessment of endangerment (scientific part, using the three criteria 'past trend', 'current status' and 'prognosis'), (2) assessment of conservation value (normative part, using the three criteria 'degree of naturalness', 'relevance for species conservation' and 'global relevance'), and (3) a combination of (1) and (2) to derive a need for action (conservation prioritization). These steps are all based on the successive aggregation of quantitative criteria via decision matrices, which makes the assessment process transparent, avoids definition gaps and allows easy adjustment of the decision rules.Conclusions: Plant community types derived from well-documented classifications of extensive vegetation-plot databases in combination with a transparent conservation assessment methodology have great potential in nature conservation and environmental monitoring. We suggest that the presented methodology is an improvement on traditional expert judgments as it separates the scientific and normative parts of the evaluation and uses clear, quantitative criteria and explicit rules to connect these into aggregated measures. It worked effectively and yielded meaningful results for a German federal state. By adjusting the scaling of the criteria, the approach can be adapted, as a whole or in part, to other regions or higher levels of ecosystem typology."	42	0	0	0	36	0	48	2014-07-01	WOS:000337725300013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

How do they correspond to the Ellenberg indicator value for N (EIV-N) of the herb layer vegetation? Location Three areas in central Bohemia (Czech Republic) underlain by different geological substrates. Methods We assessed the herb layer species composition in nine oak-dominated forests growing on different substrates, in relation to both soil nutrient pools and oak leaf nutrient concentrations. Data on the herb layer vegetation composition were collected in 16 square plots (25 m2 each) distributed according to a fixed stratified random design at each site. Soil nutrient pools were calculated on the basis of nutrient concentration and weight of quantitative soil samples taken from six defined depth strata at each of two or three 0.5-m2 pits at each site. Foliar analyses were based on samples of 150 leaves from the upper part of the canopy of five oaks at each site. Results The mean Shannon diversity index of herb layer vegetation was negatively related to the mean foliar Ntot. concentration, whereas the mean recovery rate (RR) of herb layer species was strongly positively related to foliar d15N signatures and, less markedly, to the soil Ntot. pool. Similarly, both the foliar d15N and the soil Ntot. pool were positively correlated with mean-weighted EIV-N in the herb layer vegetation. Conclusions The herb layer species diversity and composition was significantly related to N availability at our study sites. Foliar N concentration and the d15N signature may reliably indicate: (i) the current N status of oak-dominated forests, in accordance with previous published findings; and (ii) the consequences of that N status for the herb layer species diversity and composition. Foliar d15N may also be used to detect the susceptibility of an ecosystem to the spread of a few species with high colonization ability in the herb layer, at the expense of other forest species."	7	0	0	0	5	0	7	2012-07-25	WOS:000305936800003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Nineteen environmental variables at 50 randomly selected sites, species composition at sites with and without R. megapolitanum and the spatial patterns of distribution of the species at the landscape scale were analysed. We compared actual distribution data of three rare species (Didymodon acutus, Pleurochaete squarrosa R. megapolitanum) and a common one (Brachythecium rutabulum) with the distribution obtained by vouchers that were collected between 1860 and 1940 in the investigated area.

We four d significant differences between sites with and without R. megapolitanum with regard to grassland size, the percentage of si It and of band in the soil. There were fewer occurrences of h storic herbarium vouchers of R. megapolitanum than our current field survey discovered. The GIS based analyses of distribution patterns at the landscape scale showed a clustering of sites in which R. megapolitanum was present or absent. Simulations with a spatially realistic expansion model showed high similarities to the actual distribution of the species.Conclusions: All these analyses suggest that R. megapolitanum has been expanding in the investigated area.

Plants are solid indicators of soil nutrient status, because their growth reflects nutrient availability integrated over a certain period. The use of reflectance spectroscopy to estimate vegetation nutrient content has the potential to offer a fast and efficient approach to provide information about soil nutrient availability for plants. Here, we investigated the effect and relative importance of vegetation phosphorus content compared with vegetation nitrogen content and species identity in explaining variation in vegetation reflectance. Location Pot experiment mimicking Western European grassland communities on a restoration trajectory. Methods We combined a pot experiment with a broad range of mesotrophic grassland species growing along a soil phosphorus gradient with a multivariate modelling approach. We measured vegetation spectra and vegetation phosphorus and nitrogen content in monocultures and mixtures. Results Although vegetation biochemistry explained a considerable part of the variation in vegetation reflectance, we found no pronounced absorption features for vegetation nitrogen and phosphorus content across the reflectance spectrum. The relatively large effect of species and community identity suggest that other drivers, for example vegetation architecture, overruled the effect of vegetation biochemistry on the reflectance spectrum. Our findings indicate that species detection and indirect case-specific estimation of nutrients is possible, especially in structurally less-complex canopies such as monospecific grass swards. Conclusions Disentangling the specific drivers of variation in spectral reflectance is challenging. Many studies confound the effect of species identity on the vegetation reflectance spectrum with the effect of vegetation biochemistry. Here, we showed the importance of explicitly taking species identity into account.

Environmental variables were recorded at the nodes of a grid within the plots. The relationships between the upperstory and regeneration were evaluated by bivariate point pattern analysis; redundancy analysis ordination and variation partitioning were performed to characterize regeneration niches and the importance of the spatial component.ResultsSeedlings and saplings presented a clumped structure under both types of management and their distribution was found to be related to the spatial distribution of favourable microsites. Regeneration was positively related to conditions of partial cover with high soil water content during the summer. More than half of the explained variance was spatially structured in both types of stand. This percentage was particularly high in the even-aged stands where the pattern of regeneration was highly influenced by the gaps created by harvesting.ConclusionsThe spatial distribution of the tree and shrub upperstory strongly influences regeneration patterns of P. sylvestris.

Clear-cuttings and mature forests were distinctly separated by multivariate analyses (DCA). Several dozen species not found in forests were common in clear-cut areas. Most of them probably belong to the neglected native species pool of early boreal forest succession and are dependent on the long-term persistent seed bank or effective wind dispersal. It is emphasized that in forests many plant species are confined to the very early stages (< 2 yr) after disturbance. The storage effect of the long-term persistent seed bank is crucial for the maintenance of plant diversity in boreal forests.

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	1	1	NA	NA	67	74	NA	10.2307/1479086	Article	MAY 1998	1998	"Rare vascular plant species are endangered worldwide. Population losses are most commonly caused by human-related factors. Conservation management seeks to halt this adverse trend and if possible, to enhance long-lasting self-sustainable populations. In general, rare species are poorly recruited from seed banks, or disperse themselves very poorly. It may be a management option to translocate such plants by seeds and/or transplants. This paper asks which problems may be faced. It is argued that translocation is only acceptable if it is based on knowledge of species biology and ecology and the size and structure of its geographic range through time. Such knowledge of rare species is often lacking. The finite management goal can only be achieved if conservationists closely cooperate with both ecologists and geneticists."	13	0	0	0	12	0	16	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Most of these forests have been coppiced for centuries until 60-70 years ago, and today, some are lapsed coppices and others in conversion to high forests. In both cases there is a lack of knowledge on the ongoing ecological dynamics, especially with regard of species composition changes, that is a base for their sustainable management.LocationCentral Apennines (Italy).MethodsWe analyzed forest structure and their impact on plant diversity from 50 plots in three sites where forests have been differently managed also in relation to their private, common or public ownership. We assessed the relationships between forest structure and understory plant diversity, applying multivariate statistical analysis and running regression models for estimating the influence of forest structure variables on species richness.ResultsWe appraised the heterogeneity of the 9210* Apennines beech forests featuring five floristic-vegetation groups with cluster analysis in four structure stand types: lapsed coppices (LPC), coppices in conversion (CCO), two-layer coppices (TLC) and recolonized stored coppices (RSC). The Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination shows that CCO, the most common structural type investigated, is not clearly related to any specific variable. The best models suggested that the mean cambial age and tree height can positively predict all dependent richness variables.ConclusionsThe structural and compositional diversities of these forests require an innovative management approach integrating silvicultural options commonly considered divergent (coppice vs. high forests) for providing new ecosystem services and socioeconomic opportunities for local mountain communities, to support biodiversity, and to increase forest resilience to natural disturbances."	2	0	0	0	0	0	2	2025-01-07	WOS:001388588500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Methods for root extraction and biomass estimation have been proposed, including the temporal prediction method. However, there are doubts if the best model to estimate total root mass varies between study sites. Additionally, there are no records regarding the prediction method's efficiency for shorter collection times than 40 min. Here, we aim to clarify these doubts. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods We extracted 1080 fine-root samples from two contrasting ecosystems at 60 time intervals of 2 min each. We then performed a model selection to identify the best-fit model and used it to find the shortest time suitable for collecting fine-root samples (40, 32, 24, 16, or 8 min). A further 448 root samples were collected from seven ecosystems by employing the shortest time tested (8 min). We calculated the percentage of estimated mass at 120 min and tested for differences between ecosystems. Results We found that Weibull was the best-fit model, and it performed well for modeling root extraction at shorter collection times. All collection times tested had excellent goodness of fit, and there was strong evidence that the estimated mass did not differ between them. Moreover, collections at 8 min were enough to make reliable estimates of fine-root mass at 120 min in all ecosystems. Conclusions Weibull is a flexible model and can accurately estimate fine-root mass at 120 min in different ecosystems. The extraction of fine roots can be reduced to four time intervals of 2 min each when using the temporal prediction method. By reducing the time spent removing roots from each soil core, researchers can increase the number of soil cores extracted per study site and characterize the environment properly."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

What are the implications of these responses for broader tree island restoration efforts?Location: Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment (LILA), Boynton Beach, Florida, USA.Methods: An experiment was designed to test hydrological and substrate effects on seedling growth and survivorship. Two islands-a peat and a limestone-core island representing two major types found in the Everglades-were constructed in four macrocosms. A mixture of eight tree species was planted on each island in March of 2006 and 2007. Survival and height growth of seedlings planted in 2006 were assessed periodically during the next two and a half years.Results: Survival and growth improved with increasing elevation on both tree island substrate types. Seedlings' survival and growth responses along a moisture gradient matched species distributions along natural hydrological gradients in the Everglades. The effect of substrate on seedling performance showed higher survival of most species on the limestone tree islands, and faster growth on their peat-based counterparts.Conclusions: The present results could have profound implications for restoration of forests on existing landforms and artificial creation of tree islands.

We applied Canonical Correlation Analysis to test the correlation between floristic composition of the cells and land cover. We classified the cells by clustering methods, based on land cover description. With these clusters, we analysed the variation of species composition of urban vegetation along a gradient of urban density. We used Jaccard's similarity index to compare floristic composition of the clusters with the floristic composition of the homogeneous cells with respect to the land cover types. To answer question 2, we calculated land cover heterogeneity with the Shannon index and correlated the number of species in clusters with land cover heterogeneity and urban density.Results: Each land cover type contributes to species richness and species composition of the clusters. Species richness decreases significantly and linearly as urban density increases and land cover heterogeneity decreases in the clusters.Conclusions: A data mining approach can combine different existing projects to improve knowledge of the urban vegetation system.

At the community level, the results indicate multiple limitation by N and P in the two least productive rich-fen communities: one characterized by small sedges and herbs, and the other by high abundance of Menyanthes trifoliata and tall sedges. Increased nutrient availability had no effect on a more highly productive, tall-growing, spring-influenced community, indicating no nutrient limitation. The results at the species level correspond well with those at the community level, indicating multiple limitation by N and P in most of the dominant and sub-dominant species. However, P seems to limit growth more than N in Succisa pratensis, and N seems to limit growth more than P in Carex panicea. Furthermore, Eriophorum angustifolium seems to be limited by K.

Dehesas have traditionally been used for extensive livestock raising and matorral was periodically burnt, cut or pulled out. The two latter practices are now out of use. However, burning is more frequent than in the past. The effects of fire, cutting, and pulling out of C. multiflorus on its regeneration was studied in order to ascertain whether the presently increasing distribution of the species relates to fire-stimulated regeneration or to the reduction of other traditional practices. Three years after treatment two sets of parameters were determined: 1. Plant origin: seedlings and different ramet types (ramets=resprout clumps), density, weight, and biomass as well as the percentage of resprouting. 2. Seed persistence at various soil depths. The possible mechanisms of breaking dormancy and plant emergence in different years after fire were studied in other experiments. The results suggest that the regeneration mechanism in C. multiflorus is stimulated by fire, but it is not an exclusive relationship. Stimulation occurs also after other disturbances leading to the total elimination of aerial biomass. The present expansion of the species does not appear to result from the abandonment of some traditional practices, such as cutting or pulling out, but from frequent fires (resulting in aerial-biomass elimination)."	12	0	0	0	5	0	13	1999-12-01	WOS:000208472100009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Their dependency on previous and present land-use calls for tools to estimate the outcomes of different forest management strategies on their abundance. Here we built models for estimating their cover as a response to forest structure, soils, and legacy effects, with the ultimate target to be used in decision support systems to be able to adapt future management. LocationSweden. MethodsWe fitted Generalized Linear Mixed Models with beta error distribution, and accounting for zero-inflation, based on data (n > 2800) on plant cover, forest structure, and soils from the Swedish National Forest Inventory. ResultsThe resulting best models include forest density and tree species composition, and their interaction effects, likely governing the light availability in the forest understory for all three species. These models also included soil fertility indicated by the C:N ratio, the age of the forest as an indicator of time since disturbance, and the cover of the focal species 10 years earlier to account for legacy and time-lag effects. Although these variables were important for the model predictions of all three species, there were interspecific differences in the response due to the stress tolerance of the species and their placement in the leaf economics spectrum. ConclusionsWe show that it is possible to predict the cover of these species with higher accuracy (R2 = 0.44-0.60) than previously has been achieved, using predictors available from for example, national forest inventories. Hence, our models will improve the estimations of the outcomes of different forest management strategies on the cover of these species.

Here, we examine how tree phylogenetic diversity and structure have responded to profound landscape alteration and subsequent non-random species losses within forest islands created within a vast hydroelectric reservoir. Location Balbina Hydroelectric Dam Reservoir, Central Brazilian Amazonia. Methods We used a large tree data set including 435 subplots of 0.05 ha each in 34 forest islands of variable sizes and three continuous forest sites in the Balbina Hydroelectric Dam, which contained 11,000 stems representing 365 species and 188 genera. In each subplot we quantified tree phylogenetic diversity and structure and investigated their relationship with landscape structure metrics and the proportion of species within specific functional groups. Results We uncovered a reduction in phylogenetic diversity in small (<10 ha) isolated islands, particularly in more fire-prone areas near forest edges and surrounded by low amounts of forest cover. Additionally, assemblage-wide phylogenetic decay was a result of non-random species losses, given that tree assemblages dominated by small-seeded, soft-wooded pioneer species exhibited lower values of phylogenetic diversity and structure. We also uncovered a phylogenetic signal in traits associated with disturbance-adapted species within this major man-made forest archipelago. Conclusion We uncovered pronounced phylogenetic diversity decay that was mostly driven by the proliferation of disturbance-adapted species, such as small-seeded pioneer species exhibiting fast life histories. Our results undermine more optimistic views based on studies in fragmented landscapes dominated by terrestrial matrix habitats, and indicate that true land-bridge forest islands experience more detrimental effects on different components of tree diversity. Our study contributes to elucidate a growing underestimation of the pervasive threats posed by mega-dams to tropical forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning."	6	0	0	0	2	0	6	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

However, human modifications to the flood regime may change the magnitude of disturbance and stress, leading to different species distribution patterns along environmental gradients. We aimed to study the effects of local- and broad-scale environmental gradients on riparian plant CSR (Competitors-Stress tolerators-Ruderals) strategies along a highly regulated river.Location Rhone River, France.Methods We assessed how changes in elevation, fine sediment and temperature influenced CSR strategies of riparian plant communities, by studying variations in the community-weighted means and the functional dispersion of the CSR values, on gravel bars along a 250 km north-south river corridor.Results Species with contrasting ecological strategies co-occurred less on gravel bars subject to fine sediment deposition, leading to patterns of biotic homogenization along the flood gradients. Furthermore, a shift in CSR strategies from ruderal to stress-tolerant communities occurred along the elevation gradient on bars with low proportions of fine sediments and from stress-tolerant to ruderal communities along the elevation gradient on bars with high proportions of fine sediments. Regarding the climatic gradient, the mean value of ruderals increased with temperatures. Also, for stress tolerators, the dispersion value diverged between the northern and southern gravel bars when the proportion of fine sediments was low and converged when the proportion of fine sediments was high.Conclusions Overbank fine sedimentation alleviates the intensity of stress along not only the elevation gradient but also the climatic gradient. By homogenizing the functional composition of communities, this process may have detrimental consequences for riparian plant diversity, especially of ruderal plants in the littoral zone. In regulated river systems, restoration measures should therefore promote an increase in the intensity of: (a) disturbance through the reactivation of bedload supply and transport; and (b) stress through increased flow dynamics."	14	1	0	0	13	0	15	2020-04-22	WOS:000527655400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

To investigate the short-term effects of forest management on understory vegetation, we asked: (a) Are there any plant indicator species associated with different felling intensities? (b) What are the differences in abundance of plant functional types along the disturbance gradient? (c) How do typical forest species respond to silvicultural treatments? Location Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia. Methods At each of three study sites in Illyrian beech forests, nine plots (4,000 m(2)) were established, comprising a total of 27 plots. Three different felling intensities were implemented at each site, with one third of the plots assigned to each treatment: control, 50% of the growing stock removed and 100% of the growing stock removed. In the centre of each plot, a vegetation survey of vascular plants was done before (in 2012) and two years after (in 2014) felling in a circular sampling area of 400 m(2). We employed indicator species analysis, and species were grouped into functional types with respect to their traits. Results Understory species composition differed significantly between treatments. Forty-seven species (out of 251) were significantly associated with the 100% felling intensity. This relatively high number of indicators was due to the post-disturbance colonization of early-successional, non-forest species, coupled with the expansion of pre-treatment resident species. Only one species was a strong indicator for the 50% felled plots, while three species showed a preference for the unfelled plots. Graminoids, tall perennial forbs, annual/biennial forbs and legumes exhibited the most prominent increase in cover at the 50% and 100% felling intensity. Ferns showed non-significant changes, whereas woody plants exhibited a decrease in the most intensive treatment. In general, most of the typical forest species responded with increased frequency and/or abundance after felling. Conclusions The post-treatment taxonomic and functional composition of plant communities exhibited the largest changes in the most intensively felled stands. Overall, in the short term, ecological conditions in canopy gaps were not modified to an extent that would be detrimental to the persistence of typical forest species."	26	1	0	0	22	0	29	2019-03-11	WOS:000459825800006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Have species with intermediate canopy density more pronounced facilitative effects on understorey primary production, community composition and diversity? How are canopy effects related to species' encroachment status, and modulated by a local aridity gradient?Location: Upland and lowland environments of the Borana rangelands, an arid thornbush savanna in southern Ethiopia.Methods: We harnessed pastoralists' local ecological knowledge to rank the encroachment status of six legume tree species previously known as Acacia, and correlated this rank to a dendrometric proxy of canopy density. Vegetation releves (1 m(2)) were placed in sub-canopy and adjacent inter-canopy habitats of four legume tree species that differed in canopy density and encroachment status (Vachellia bussei, V. drepanolobium, V. seyal, V. tortilis). Using mixed-effects ANOVA, we evaluated effects of tree species and habitat (sub-canopy or inter-canopy) on total, forb and grass biomass, and on species diversity, comparing results for lowland and upland sites. Effects on floristic composition were assessed via PERMANOVA and NMDS.Results: Species' encroachment status and canopy density were negatively correlated. Most pronounced facilitative effects (more frequent and larger differences between sub-canopy and inter-canopy habitats) were found for a species with intermediate canopy density (V. bussei). Diversity in its understorey vegetation increased up to 32% (total biomass: 29%, forb biomass: 40%). In contrast, the species with the most open canopy (V. drepanolobium; also the most encroaching species) never exerted significant facilitative effects. In contrast to expectations, canopy effects were more frequent in (climatically less arid) upland environments, probably due to a redistribution of water within the landscape. Large differences in facilitative effects across tree individuals indicate that a high intraspecific variability of canopy traits and/or small-scale differences in abiotic site conditions have partly overridden species-specific differences in canopy architecture.Conclusion: Our study provides new insights on why encroaching legume tree species may decrease herbaceous production: they tend to have more open canopies, with small facilitative effects on sub-canopy herbaceous production. We thus recommend promoting an open savanna with the tree layer dominated by species with a high facilitative potential tomaintain forage provision and species diversity."	20	2	0	0	18	0	21	2016-04-01	WOS:000374545600013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

In the grid technique, a grid was superimposed onto the photographs and the frequency of species presence in each grid-square was calculated to estimate species abundance/cover over the defined area. In the object-oriented technique, the photographs were segmented into meaningful objects, based on the colour of the pixels and the textural patterns of the images, and the area occupied by an object in the image was used to derive species abundance/cover over the area.ResultsBoth techniques allow quick and easy classification of digital elements into ecologically relevant categories of vegetation components. The grid technique appeared more robust, being quick and efficient, accommodating all image types and providing presence/absence matrices for multivariate analysis. Fewer classes were identified using the object-oriented technique, in particular for the forest interior site and for small individual plants such as Astelia spp.ConclusionsBoth techniques showed potential for the objective quantitative analysis of long-term vegetation monitoring of cover and changes of several component species, using repeat ground-based photographs more specifically for grassland habitats.

All models were modified to use leaf area index (LAI), vertically projected leaf area index (PLAI), or percentage cover data.Results: The empirical Beer's Law models had the least bias and best precision in predicting PAR transmission. The semi-empirical model also had little bias and good precision, since the scattering coefficient compensated for problems in the estimation of gap fraction. The multi-layer model consistently underestimated transmission. There was little benefit in accounting for species separately. LAI and PLAI-based models were the most precise, but percentage cover models also provided reasonable predictions of PAR transmission.Conclusions: PAR transmission through forest understories can be simply modelled with Beer's Law using one empirical coefficient representing the average understorey species. More complex scattering models are less effective, likely because they fail to account for the complexity of the dispersion of this vegetation layer and its effect on radiation scattering."	4	0	0	0	2	0	6	2005-05-01	WOS:000232547000009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Three trends were noticed: decrease of aquatic species, spread of Cladium mariscus and establishment of woody species (especially Alnus glutinosa and Frangula alnus). None of these trends was prevented by mowing, but mowing did prevent the accumulation of C. mariscus litter and kept woody saplings small. Succession was generally slow and often occurred in the form of sudden, discrete changes. Plant species richness increased with mowing and remained constant without mowing. Soil disturbance by the mowing machine contributed more to the effects of management on species composition than the periodic removal of biomass. It is concluded that mowing every three years in winter is insufficient to preserve semi-aquatic communities against succession but sufficient to maintain the plant species richness of a low productive, regularly flooded fen."	27	1	0	0	23	0	32	2004-05-01	WOS:000221960200006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Common reed (Phragmites australis Trin.) has spread in fen meadows on the Swiss Plateau during the last decades. An increased dominance of this tall grass may reduce the plant species richness and displace rare or endangered species because of the additional shade. To investigate whether this has actually happened and whether shading by Phragmites was likely to be responsible for the reduction, the plant species composition was surveyed in 241 plots (4 m2) with differing above-ground biomass of Phragmites (ABP). Species richness and the occurrence of characteristic fen species were negatively related to site productivity (total above-ground biomass), but correlations with ABP were generally weaker. The main change associated with increasing ABP within species-rich fens (alliances Molinion and Caricion davallianae) was an increase of species characteristic of the more species-poor alliance Filipendulion. Thus, Phragmites did apparently not play a disproportionate role in the reduction of species richness in the plant communities studied. Selective clipping experiments and light measurements also indicated that shading by Phragmites does not have a strong effect upon the performance of other species in the community, at least in the short term. The reason appeared to lie in the later seasonal growth of Phragmites compared with the other species. These results suggest that the direct impact of shading by Phragmites on the species richness of fen meadows is probably lower than has been assumed. However, possible long-term or indirect effects still need to be investigated."	27	0	0	0	23	0	35	1999-05-01	WOS:000208472000008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

We propose a new method to obtain information about processes that structure plant communities. We analysed the relationship between the presence and dominance of species across a range of habitats. A simple regression model was used to describe this relationship for each species. Based on the regression parameters, we distinguished globally dominant species, which dominate in the same proportion of plots within a habitat as in which they occur, locally dominant species, which reach dominance only when present in almost every plot of a habitat, and intrinsically subordinate species, which never attain dominance. We tested this method using a large data set of species occurrences across a range of salt marsh habitats. The relationships between presence and dominance could be described well by the regressions, and showed large differences between the species. Global dominants occurred later in the succession and higher on the elevational gradient than intrinsically subordinate species. Local dominants were characteristic of early successional stages. These patterns are discussed in the light of colonisation-competition and tolerance-competition trade-offs."	22	0	1	0	16	0	24	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

A solution to maintain economically viable cultivation could be vineyard terracing. We aimed to identify the potential of terracing to enhance plant diversity and habitat heterogeneity in vineyards, analyze effects of management intensity on vineyard vegetation, and assess how plant communities change after vineyard abandonment.LocationWine-growing region of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley in Hesse (50.042342 degrees N, 7.814533 degrees E) and Rhineland-Palatinate (50.119139 degrees N, 7.719275 degrees E), Germany.MethodsWe recorded vascular plant species and local vineyard parameters in vertically oriented vineyards with vegetated and tilled open inter-rows, in terraced vineyards with tilled terrace inter-rows and extensively managed embankments, and in vineyard fallows in a total of 45 study sites. We used plant species richness, Ellenberg indicator values and Grime's strategy types to describe how traits and ecological requirements respond to distinct vineyard management.ResultsPlant species richness and composition were determined by management-derived disturbance intensities. Extensively managed embankments had a distinct plant community, the highest plant species richness, more perennial and indicator species, and lower nitrogen indicator values compared with inter-rows. By contrast, highly disturbed open and terrace inter-rows revealed plant communities associated with annuals and ruderals, but species richness did not differ between terrace inter-rows and embankments. The plant communities of fallows were completely different with lower plant diversity.ConclusionsOur results highlight the potential of terraced vineyards for plant diversity with nutrient poor, extensively managed embankments providing conditions that have become rare in modern agricultural systems. A long environmental gradient from terrace inter-rows to embankments created habitat heterogeneity within a narrow space. By contrast, intensive inter-row management in vertically oriented vineyards hampers high plant diversity and abandonment fosters the spread of woody species at the expanse of plant diversity.We evaluated how distinct vineyard management shapes plant communities and diversity along a mechanical disturbance gradient. A long environmental gradient from terrace inter-rows to embankments created habitat heterogeneity in a narrow space and favored high plant diversity. High levels of disturbance by regular tillage and mulching in vertically oriented vineyards favored annuals and ruderals, whereas abandonment fostered the spread of woody species at the expanse of plant diversity.image"	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2024-05-13	WOS:001216301000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Distinguishing the effects of soil nutrients and soil mutualists may be critical in the context of restoration, but remains poorly understood. Additionally, we asked whether pioneer species and soil conditions influenced trade-offs or complementarities between vegetation production and species diversity.Location: Plant Growth Center, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, US,Methods: Using experimental seed addition in mesocosms, we investigated how the priority effects of different plant species influenced productivity, diversity and composition of the resulting plant community. We also experimentally manipulated soil nutrients and mycorrhizae to determine how they modified those priority effects.Results: We found that. species-specific priority effects of pioneers strongly governed the productivity, diversity and species composition of the resulting community. Pioneer grasses, one native and one non-native species, both preempted light and space, prevented the colonization and growth of the subsequent community and restricted community dispersion (i.e, differences in species composition among mesocosms). By contrast, the pioneer forb species had little influence on the recruitment and establishment of the later colonizing species, and supported the assembly of divergent communities. We found evidence to suggest that amendments of soil mutualists, but. not soil nutrients, modified the influence of one pioneer species on characteristics of the resulting community by enhancing community productivity and diversity in mesocosms with non-native grass pioneers. Across all treatments, species diversity declined as vegetation production increased, indicating an overall trade-off between productivity and diversity. However, relationships between productivity and diversity varied among pioneer treatments and mycorrhizal amendments.Conclusions: Our results eniphasize important interactions between priority effects and. the use of soil mycorrhizal amendments in restoration, as well as highlight how pioneer species and mycorrhizae influence potential trade-offs between restoration objectives aimed at enhancing productivity vs species diversity."	20	2	0	0	15	0	24	2015-04-01	WOS:000352131500017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

In particular, tropical forest edges are increasingly dominated by lianas. Will this increase in lianas lead to changes in their interactions with other plant morphological groups? If so, will this alter the local distributions and abundance of other species?LocationPlots located at increasing distances from the nearest forest edge and in remnant fragments of rain forest in the Atherton Tablelands, far northeast Queensland, Australia.MethodsWe mapped the distribution of trees, lianas and epiphytic ferns to better understand the role of forest disturbance in shaping their competitive and facilitative interactions. We then used specific spatial point-process analyses to examine the effects of the spatial distribution of trees on the presence and abundance of lianas and epiphytic ferns.ResultsTree aggregation near forest edges was lower than that in the interior. The higher abundance of lianas near edges was associated with increased spatial segregation between lianas and epiphytic ferns. This segregation suggests there is competition between these two functional groups, and that lianas, being much more abundant, probably outcompete epiphytic ferns.ConclusionsThe ability of lianas to thrive in disturbed tropical rain forests appears to reduce the abundance of epiphytic ferns, probably via direct competition for space. Epiphytic ferns provide unique microclimates and harbour much biodiversity, and their decline could negatively affect many animals and plants that rely upon them."	23	1	0	0	23	4	25	2014-10-01	WOS:000342839200016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

All 61 400-m(2) sampling sites were controlled for overstorey composition (Deciduous, Mixed and Coniferous) and disturbance type, which consisted of three fire impact severity (FIS) classes (Light, Moderate and Extreme) and two harvesting techniques (Stem-only and Whole-tree Harvesting). Percent-cover data of vegetation and post-disturbance environmental characteristics were recorded in the field during the first two years after fire as well as soil texture. Ordination of fire alone demonstrated that, on Coniferous sites, fire initiates a succession whereby the understorey Coniferous sites approaches that of Deciduous-Mixed sites, due to the release of the understorey from Sphagnum spp. dominance, this pattern being a function of FIS. On Deciduous-Mixed stands, increased FIS resulted in a transition from herb to shrub dominance. Ordination of all five disturbance types showed that the impact of salvage-logging on understorey composition was within the range of fire, but marginalized to the extreme end of the FIS spectrum. Variance partitioning demonstrated that overstorey and soil texture were the most important explanatory variables of fire alone, while disturbance type explained the largest independent fraction of understorey variation when salvage-logging was introduced. Salvage-logging also results in significant reductions in understorey abundance, richness and diversity, while indicator species analysis suggests that it favours mesoxerophytic to xeric species. Results are interpreted in light of shade-tolerance dynamics, forest floor disturbance and soil moisture regimes. Implications for sustainable forest management are discussed."	69	2	0	0	61	0	79	2004-05-01	WOS:000221960200007	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise for the foreseeable future, and, due to radiative forcing, surface temperatures will also increase. If soils warm sufficiently, this will result in increased litter decomposition rates, while nitrogen availability will also rise due to increased deposition. A field-based experiment manipulating air temperatures using polythene tents and nitrogen availability by adding 50 kg N ha-1 yr-1 has shown that this will result in further encroachment of Pteridium into Calluna moorland. Although this experiment, treating plots on and around the boundary between Pteridium and Calluna, did not show any statistically significant effect on the movement of the boundary, there were clear indications of Calluna dieback at the boundary. In addition, the frequency of Pteridium fronds increased in the Calluna-dominated areas, while Calluna became less abundant in the pure Pteridium plots. Calluna dieback was not due to litter accumulation as is frequently assumed, but the dieback is likely to be caused by shading of Calluna by the increased growth of Pteridium fronds. Botanical diversity was higher in the Pteridium plots, but considering the importance of grouse shooting for the maintenance of Calluna moorland, displacement of Calluna by Pteridium may result in a lower conservation and economic value of moorlands."	5	0	0	0	1	0	5	1999-12-01	WOS:000208472100005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Assessing the efficiency of policy implementation relies on species- and trait-based indicators. However, the choice of indicators and analytical approaches to estimate them can affect the interpretation of monitoring results and, consequently, policy design. We assessed long-term changes in widened grassy field margins and compared the results of three indicator estimation methods.QuestionDoes newly formed vegetation in widened grassy margins advance ecological functionality? What impact does down-weighting or exclusion of subordinate species have on the interpretation?DataIn total, 435 vegetation records from 165 new or widened field margins in Estonia, were observed during 12 years of monitoring.ResultsConclusions about vegetation dynamics varied between the indicators and their estimation methods. When an all-species dataset was used for trait estimation, either as occurrence data or as community-weighted means, many indicators suggested only minor changes or fluctuating dynamics over time. By addressing abundant species only, evident community changes were detected and many indicators suggested functional improvements. These improvements mostly occurred in the first few years, and the following long-term changes remained limited. There was general agreement between methods about the decline in potential weediness and the prevalence of taller growth forms with leafy stems. Abundant species indicated improved species richness, support for pollinators and seed foragers.ConclusionsCommunity monitoring should place more attention on abundant species as the main providers of ecosystem services. Information provided by subordinate and rare species is valuable to estimate species richness, but can be noisy to assess ecosystem functional status and mislead to the conclusion of resilience or stability. The slow pace of community change indicates a need for stability in agricultural environmental measures over several policy application cycles."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2025-08-17	WOS:001546238900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Identification of substitute hosts is required in the face of epidemic tree deaths due to diseases that are a threat to affiliated epiphytic communities. We assess the suitability of seven phorophytes to host the epiphytes associated with the UK native oak species, Quercus petraea and Quercus robur, which are currently threatened by a range of pests and pathogens. Location Six botanic gardens and arboreta across the UK. Method We recorded the site, habitat, tree (height, diameter at breast height [1.3 m; DBH], percentage canopy cover) and bark characteristics (pH, conductivity, density, water-holding capacity, hardness, topography) and epiphytic community composition on Acer pseudoplatanus, Castanea sativa, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus cerris, Quercus petraea, Quercus robur, Quercus rubra and Tilia x europaea. In total 230 trees were surveyed across the six sites. Results Comparisons between all trees showed significant correlations between similarities in community composition and bark characteristics. However, tree characteristics (species, height, DBH and canopy over) explained more of the variation in epiphytic community composition than bark and site characteristics. Phorophytes with similar epiphytic community richness or composition to native oaks did not necessarily have similar bark characteristics. Non-native oaks and the non-native hybrid Tilia x europaea supported similar epiphyte communities to the native oaks and are suggested as substitute phorophytes. Conclusion Using bark traits is not a reliable method to assess the suitability of substitute phorophytes to conserve epiphytic communities. Instead, the epiphytes hosted by a wider range of phorophytes should be recorded to allow an assessment of their suitability as substitute hosts and hence aid management decisions on replacement phorophytes following tree loss."	16	0	0	0	13	1	18	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Percentage cover of individual plant species was estimated by visual observation in each plot in late June in the years 2005-2014.Results Despite inter-annual variability in the cover of the individual vascular plant species, the multivariate data analyses revealed a relatively similar response of the plant community to the different fertilizer applications throughout the ten years. With phosphorus application, no differences in botanical composition among treatments were found; however, they did differ from other treatments without phosphorus application. In the unfertilized control, there was a certain directed trend in plant species composition in response to ongoing nutrient impoverishment.Conclusion Species-rich grasslands of high nature conservation value were only maintained under P limitation in the control without fertilizer application (Violion caninae) and in the liming treatment (Polygono-Trisetion), but also in the treatment with liming and pure N addition.

With hardscape habitats (HH), humans have created a novel land-cover type that is physically analogous to extreme terrestrial environments such as deserts, barrens, and rocky outcrops and may harbor rare or specialist species and communities. We addressed the following questions: (a) which plant species inhabit hardscapes; (b) do hardscapes serve as a refuge for rare or specialist species; (c) how taxonomically similar are hardscape plant communities to one another and the regional species pool; (d) is phylogenetic diversity of hardscape communities different from that of the regional species pool; and (e) which functional traits and life history strategies are filtered for or against in hardscape plant communities?Location and MethodsWe surveyed the vascular plant communities of 17 asphalt parking lots in New Jersey, USA, to use as a focal hardscape habitat for this study.ResultsParking-lot plant communities contained 119 vascular plant taxa out of the 2,199 regional species and had a lower beta and phylogenetic diversity than the regional species pool. The parking-lot flora had significantly higher frequencies of annuals, biennials, C-4 plants, ruderal strategists, non-natives, herbaceous plants, self-compatible species, and species from the Caryophyllales, Asterales, Ulmaceae, and Plantaginaceae clades compared to the regional pool and contained no New Jersey threatened or endangered species.ConclusionsHardscape habitats may be similar to naturally occurring, extreme terrestrial environments in that they impose stringent filters on ecological communities leading to increased proportions of short-lived and C-4 plant species compared to the regional pool. Nevertheless, hardscapes are unlikely to serve as biodiversity refuges in the Northeastern USA as they create novel abiotic conditions that may be hostile to many native, rare, and specialist species."	6	0	0	0	4	0	7	2019-11-19	WOS:000494681700010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

We characterized management practices implemented on the different elements, i.e., the frequency and timing of mowing (early summer or late summer), the frequency of herbicide treatment in field margins and the N input rate. We retrieved from databases seven functional traits and types known to be influenced by management practices. To identify relationships between traits or types and environmental variables we first performed partial RLQ analyses to remove any potential confounding effect of the landscape context studied. We then computed fourth-corner statistics to quantify relationships between traits or types, environmental variables and partial RLQ axes.ResultsLate mowing of the berm promoted nitrophilous species within berms and competitive rather than ruderal species within arable field margins. The frequency of herbicide treatment in field margins promoted broad-leaf species within this element and, to a lesser extent, within embankments. Finally, the functional characteristics of communities of the three elements were not influenced by the level of N input in field margins.ConclusionsIn our environmental context, managing road verges affected the functional structure of plant assemblages both within them and within their adjacent arable field margins.

The widespread use is in contrast to the lack of direct calibration against soil chemical proxies of nutrient availability. Lack of calibration and range contraction due to averaging of a bounded ordinal scale hinder the interpretation of mN across studies. Based on a large set of concomitant vegetation-soil data we asked: (1) which is the best single soil predictor of mN, (2) which combination of soil variables best explains mN; and (3) can a meaningful relative scale of mN be provided for comparative purposes?Location: Forests in Germany, sampled in a systematic 8 km 9 8 km grid.Methods: The German National Forest Soil Inventory (NFSI) provides a large, representative sample of joint soil and vegetation plots, which were additionally intersected with modelled background N deposition. Values of mN of vegetation plots were related to measured 36 soil and three deposition variables by correlation and multiple regression. The distribution of mN was partitioned based on quantiles.Results: In NFSI mN was most closely related to the C/N ratio of the topsoil (r(2) = 0.31). Multiple analysis regression showed that soil acidity, soil P and K, humus quality and deposition were complementary predictors (multiple r(2) = 0.47) of mN.Conclusions: Values of mN are moderately, but consistently, related to measurable chemical properties of forest soils. The 10, 30, 70 and 90% quantiles of the frequency distribution of mN in the NFSI data are proposed to define a relative scale of macronutrient availability in forest soils, distinguishing very oligotrophic (mN < 3.38), oligotrophic (3.38-4.8), mesotrophic (4.80-5.75), eutrophic (5.75-6.21) and highly eutrophic (>6.21) sites, which broadly correspond to conventional classes of C/N ratio used in forest site mapping. This proposed five-class trophic scale can be used to compare mN and its trends across studies in forest vegetation of Central Europe."	23	0	0	0	18	1	23	2017-01-01	WOS:000396473500013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

(2) Are seed density and species richness of seed species dispersed into deforested areas enhanced by perch structures? (3) Do morphological seed traits of forest and non-forest plant species change from the forest interior to deforested areas?LocationDeforested tropical mountains of Chulumani, La Paz, Bolivia.MethodsAt eight study sites, we installed a system of 38 seed traps along a transect of 240m from the forest interior (160m from the forest margin) toward deforested areas (80m from the forest margin). Half of the seed traps installed in the deforested areas were positioned under perch structures. We identified captured seeds to morpho-species or species level and recorded morphological seed traits (i.e. seed mass, seed length, seed width) and species origin (i.e. late-successional, pioneer, non-forest species).ResultsSeed density and species richness of late-successional and pioneer species declined from the forest interior toward deforested areas. Seed limitation was particularly strong for large-seeded species. Perches in deforested areas strongly increased the density and to some extent as well as the species richness of seeds dispersed into these areas, but did not alter the composition of seed traits and species origin in comparison to seed traps without perches.ConclusionsWe found a strong seed dispersal limitation in deforested areas, which was mitigated by the presence of perch structures, at least in terms of seed density and species richness. However, the dispersal limitation of late-successional plant species with large seeds was not compensated by the presence of perching structures. Nevertheless, the establishment of artificial perch structures is likely to be a promising strategy for capturing seeds in deforested areas that may establish under bracken fronds in the long term."	21	1	0	0	20	0	23	2015-09-30	WOS:000361181500007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Thus, the aim of this study was to test whether the phenological development of plant species in a peatland ecosystem changed with higher temperatures, increased water table level or a combination of the two.LocationFen peatland site in Bavaria, Germany.MethodsIn 2010, manipulative experiments with two different treatments (control and warming) and in 2011 with four different treatments (control, warming, increased water table level, warming + increased water table level) were conducted. Temperature was raised 0.4-1.5 degrees C with open-top chambers (OTCs) from August 2009 onwards, and water table level was elevated 12cm using a pumping system, however the latter was not continuous for the whole growing season of 2011 due to technical difficulties. Phenological development of different grassland species was observed weekly using the BBCH code. Attention focused on reproductive phenology (from flower development to fruit senescence) and on key single phenological phases, such as flower development, flowering, ripening and fruit senescence, as well as the duration of key phases. Additionally, vegetation height was measured.ResultsOur study showed that higher temperatures advanced reproductive phenology and most key phases, except fruit senescence. Water table manipulations had no significant influence on phenology. The duration of key phases was generally not significantly influenced by treatments, whereas vegetation height differed between control and higher temperature plots.ConclusionIn general, raising the water table to reduce carbon release from drained peatland sites will not dramatically affect phenological development of grassland species, whereas increased temperatures will affect reproductive phenology."	11	2	0	0	10	0	12	2014-11-05	WOS:000342839200004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

They also consider the ecological gradients or the 'Umwelt' (species-specific perception of the landscape) to represent the processes that ultimately limit organisms' ability to colonize and persist within habitat remnants. Are these approaches suitable for evaluating the response of plant species to fragmentation?LocationFragmented mid-elevation temperate forests, Cantabrian range, Spain.MethodsThe presence, abundance and demographic structure of populations of the perennial herb Primula vulgaris were sampled across a continuous extent of 100 ha, subdivided into 400 50 m x 50 m sampling units. These variables were related to forest availability, forest subdivision and edge density, topography and the spatial clumpiness of populations (a measure of plant dispersal constraints and, hence, a major surrogate of plant Umwelt).ResultsFragmentation processes, especially habitat loss, negatively affect P. vulgaris, with a stronger effect on presence than on abundance and demography. Despite the importance of habitat availability, P. vulgaris does not occupy all potentially suitable forest habitat, mostly owing to dispersal constraints. A positive effect of slope on plant presence also suggests some effect of habitat quality in determining establishment and occupancy of forest landscape.ConclusionsWithin-habitat dispersal constraints are as important as forest fragmentation in determining the landscape-scale distribution of P. vulgaris. By assessing the relative role of the diverse fragmentation processes, and of the species' landscape perception, a continua landscape approach proves to be a valuable tool for predicting plant response to landscape change."	7	0	0	0	5	0	7	2009-10-01	WOS:000269455100010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

The vegetation of abandoned fens shifts to trees and shrubs after 10-15 years, which shade the smaller and rarer species of these wetlands. While careful use of fire is used to manage fens in North America, it is not widely used in European fens, perhaps because the peat of drained fens may catch fire. Cattle grazing cannot be considered a natural disturbance in North America, since cattle did not evolve on that continent. In Europe, cattle do not generally graze in unaltered fens, but they do use slightly drained fen meadows.Conclusions: Three approaches have been used to control the dominance of tall woody and herbaceous species in abandoned fens, including the re-introduction of cattle, mowing, and burning. Overgrazing results in a permanent reduction in biodiversity, therefore cattle re-introduction must be approached cautiously. In Europe, but not in North America, mowing has been an important management tool, and mowing has been successful in maintaining species richness, particularly in fens that have been mowed annually for centuries. Fire has been the most common and successful management tool in North America although it is not effective in removing shrubs that have become large. Because the problems and solutions are similar, the literature of both European and North American fen management can be analyzed to better assess the management of fens on both continents. Many management questions require further study and these are listed in the paper."	152	4	0	0	139	0	177	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Vegetation changes were traced through two vegetation surveys and monitoring of permanent plots over 15 yr after the management had been changed. Exclosure experiments were started to distinguish grazing effects from effects of increased soil waterlogging caused by the neglect of the drainage system.Both vegetation Surveys and permanent plots demonstrated a dichotomy in vegetation succession. The incidence of secondary pioneer vegetation dominated by Salicornia spp. and Suaeda maritima increased from 0 to 20%, whereas the late-successional (Phragmites australis) vegetation from 10 to 15%.Grazing intensity decreased towards the sea. The grazed area contracted landward, which allowed vegetation dominated by tall species to increase seaward. Grazing and increased waterlogging interacted in several ways. The impact of trampling increased. and in the intensively grazed parts soil salinity increased. This can probably be explained by low vegetation cover in spring.Framework Ordination, an indirect-gradient-analysis technique, was used to infer the importance of environmental factors in influencing changes in species composition. Many changes were positively or negatively correlated with soil aeration and soil salinity, whereas elevation was of minor importance, Grazing accounted for only a few changes in species frequency, Changes in permanent plots were greater during the first than during the second half of the study period. In exclosures that were installed halfway through the study period, there was a relatively rapid recovery of previously dominant species that had decreased during the first half of the study period.Species richness per unit area in the reserve increased. At the seaward side of the marsh. the altered management allowed succession to proceed leading to establishment of stands of Phragmites australis. whereas on the landward side. the combination of moderate grazing with neglect of the drainage system appeared an effective measure in maintaining habitats for a wider range of halophytic species."	28	1	0	0	26	0	36	2002-05-01	WOS:000176407800003	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	YES

Do the microenvironmental conditions beneath the canopies of solitary trees alter taxonomic and functional diversities by favouring species with trait values related to shade-tolerant strategies? Do these microenvironmental conditions specifically promote the establishment and abundance of woody species beneath solitary tree canopies?Location Southern Transylvania, Romania.Methods We conducted a stratified random sampling at 30 sites in Transylvania, involving 90 plots along a microgradient of tree canopy projection-from under to outside-as a proxy for varying shadow conditions. We collected structural data on solitary trees, species cover, functional traits (plant height, specific leaf area, seed mass, and growth form) and ecological variables. We examined the effects of solitary trees' canopy projection on variation of taxonomic composition using nonmetric multidimensional scaling, analysis of similarities and indicator species analysis. We applied linear mixed effect models to test the change in taxonomic and functional diversities and the relative proportion of woody species along solitary trees' canopy projection.Results We found distinct shifts in taxonomic composition along a microgradient from under the canopy to outside areas, primarily due to changes in light availability and nutrient conditions. Decreasing light availability reduces species and functional diversities in line with the filtering effect of canopy cover. The woody species seedling establishment under the canopy projection suggested a reduction in competition with grassland species and a facilitation process exerted by adult trees.Conclusions Solitary trees are an important element of wood-pastures, creating microhabitats for shade-tolerant and woody species. Our findings underscore the importance of solitary trees in promoting different plant communities at the microscale. We suggest the application of patchy management of wood-pastures with scattered maintenance of woody species and simultaneous cutting of shrubs in places to prevent succession in case of management cessation."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-11-04	WOS:001605170400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To determine suitable management for T. latifolia control, we addressed the following question: What are the effects of long-term cutting at different frequencies (once or twice per year and no management) and biomass removal on cover and other characteristics of T. latifolia, and on sward productivity and plant species composition?Location: Mala Strana nature reserve, Jizerske hory Mountains, Czechia.Methods: A long-term experiment arranged in a randomised block design with three blocks was established in 2005. Data were collected from five treatments: unmanaged control; cutting once a year in June without biomass removal and with biomass removal; cutting twice per year in June and August without biomass removal and with biomass removal. Percentage cover of T. latifolia and other vascular plant species was visually estimated and T. latifolia characteristics (tiller density, height, dry-matter biomass [DMB] yield and litter), sward height and DMB yield were measured during 2005-2018 at the end of June.Results and Discussion: Regular cutting once or twice per year regardless of cut biomass removal led to reductions in tiller density, height, litter and DMB yield of T. latifolia. Biomass removal had only a slight tendency to affect T. latifolia characteristics. The higher frequency of cutting significantly decreased the mean T. latifolia cover, litter and DMB yield. Cutting once or twice per year regardless of biomass removal led to successive changes in plant species composition but had no effect on the species richness and evenness.Conclusions: Cutting at least once per year without biomass removal seems to be sufficient to achieve a decrease in DMB yield and litter of T. latifolia plants, and thereby maintain the wet-meadow vegetation without loss of species richness and also preventing the overgrowth of shrubs and trees."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2023-08-10	WOS:001036899800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

One barrier to native tree regeneration in degraded areas may be seed dispersal limitation. To better understand how dispersal limitation influences recovery from degradation, we tested whether the mode and rates of seed dispersal differed in degraded sites dominated either by the exotic tree Leucaena leucocephala or open areas dominated by introduced pasture grasses. We also tested whether L. leucocephala stands facilitate the recruitment of native trees by increasing their seed input compared to open grass areas. Location Guanica Commonwealth Forest, Puerto Rico. Methods Seed rain was measured for one year in traps located within five vegetation types that ranged in degree of forest degradation from open grass to intact native forest. Results In open grass areas, seed rain density was similarly low for L. leucocephala and abiotically dispersed native trees (mean [95% CI] = 50.9 [15.1-171.0] vs. 34.2 [10.3-113.5] seeds m(-2) year(-1)), whereas it was even lower for animal-dispersed native trees (0.14 [0.03-0.67] seeds m(-2) year(-1)). Compared to open grass areas, L. leucocephala-dominated stands, even those with grass understories, had higher seed rain density of animal-dispersed trees (43.0 [12.9-143.6] seeds m(-2) year(-1)), but not abiotically dispersed trees (20.8 [6.3-68.5] seeds m(-2) year(-1)). Conclusions The dominance of L. leucocephala in disturbed Caribbean dry forests does not appear to be mediated by disproportionate seed arrival in open areas compared to native tree seeds. Rather, subsequent factors such as seed and seedling survival likely favor L. leucocephala in highly degraded areas. Since L. leucocephala stands increase the seed rain of animal-dispersed native trees, retaining them in highly disturbed Caribbean dry forests may facilitate the regeneration of native forests."	12	0	0	0	9	0	13	2019-07-12	WOS:000473236900006	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Recently, traditional meadow irrigation is being re-established in some parts of Europe. Nevertheless, the consequences of the regular artificial flooding on vegetation of these water meadows remain poorly understood. We studied the impact of flood irrigation on the plant functional and species composition of extensively managed hay meadows.Location: Lowland of River Queich, between Landau and Lustadt, Germany.Methods: We sampled vegetation in 34 meadows that differed in irrigation status (irrigated/non-irrigated) and fertilization (unfertilized/fertilized). Plants were classified into functional groups according to growth forms, N-fixing ability and reproductive strategy. Effects of meadow irrigation on the plant functional composition were analysed using two complementary approaches. In the 'community approach', we analysed total cover of each functional group per meadow with respect to irrigation and fertilization. In the 'species approach', we analysed the mean response to irrigation among the species within the defined functional groups.Results: Total cover of rosettes and semi-rosettes increased relative to graminoids in irrigated meadows. Cover of legumes was three times higher in irrigated compared to non-irrigated meadows. Irrigation enhanced preferences for seed and vegetative reproduction. However, the response of individual species within the functional groups was inconsistent. Fertilization had an overall minor influence on functional composition of the meadows.Conclusions: The higher proportion of plants with basal growth organs in irrigated meadows suggests that irrigation may enhance a more complex vertical structure of the vegetation. Enhancement of rosettes, semi-rosettes and legumes at the cost of graminoids through irrigation was more significant in the community than in the species approach, indicating that the functional group response was amplified by the respective dominant species. This highlights the importance of considering species-level interactions in functional vegetation analysis."	13	2	0	0	9	0	14	2016-02-03	WOS:000368074600014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

We assessed the effects of farm management and landscape characteristics at the field and farm scales on -, - and -diversity values of these characteristic arable species. Analyses were also conducted on a subset of Secalietalia species that are considered to be rare. Statistical analyses were performed using multimodel inference determined on the basis of all possible models from an a priori set.ResultsField variables, such as years since conversion to organic management, proportion of cereal crops in the rotation and autumn sowing, had a positive effect, whereas growing non-cereal crops and fertilization had a negative effect on the richness of characteristic species. The field area had a positive effect on the species richness of characteristic and rare arable plants. At the farm level, the proportion of cereal crop fields to the total amount of fields affected both and characteristic diversity. The landscape variables at the farm level only influenced the -diversity of rare species.ConclusionsThe effects of management and landscape on arable weed diversity depended on whether the field or the farm is the focus of the analysis. Characteristic and rare arable species were more affected by factors operating at local scales. Characteristic species richness responded positively to sowing cereal crops, autumn sowing and periodic soil disturbances but was negatively affected by slurry fertilization.

Is salt application an effective management tool for controlling invaders and favouring endangered halophytes? Location Ses Fontanelles, Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. Methods The germination of seeds of L. barceloi and nine ruderal species was tested in five salinity levels (0-37gL-1), and also in freshwater after a pre-treatment with seawater. The ruderal study species were: Asphodelus fistulosus, Avena barbata, Geranium molle, Hypochoeris achyrophorus, Oryzopsis miliacea, Plantago coronopus, Reichardia picroides, Sonchus asper and Sonchus tenerrimus. Two salt concentration levels (18 and 37gL-1) were applied twice monthly, weekly or twice weekly to examine the effect of salt irrigation schemes on the performance and seedling survival of L. barceloi compared to two of the principal species invading these salt marshes, S. tenerrimus and A. fistulosus. Results Germination of L. barceloi and most ruderal species was highest at low salinity (0-8gL-1). Seeds of L. barceloi, A. fistulosus and S. tenerrimus were also able to germinate at the highest salinity level, in contrast to the other species. Germination in freshwater after seawater pre-treatment was highest in L. barceloi (72 +/- 6%). Seedling performance and survival of A. fistulosus and S. tenerrimus decreased with frequency and concentration of the salt treatment. An application of 37gL-1 salt twice a week reduced seedling survival of A. fistulosus and S. tenerrimus by 83.3 and 91.6%, respectively. In contrast, 100% of the L. barceloi seedlings survived and showed similar performance among treatments. Conclusions Limonium barceloi had higher seedling growth and survival than ruderal invaders when salinity levels were high (37gL-1). Nevertheless, at lower salinity, ruderal species may germinate and grow better and thus salinity level changes may represent a threat to the survival of this critically endangered species. Although further field testing is required, our experiments suggest that salt application could be an effective measure to protect L. barceloi and other endangered halophytic plant species from less salt-tolerant invaders."	3	0	0	0	3	0	3	2013-07-10	WOS:000319885000010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Glyphosate application shifts vegetation composition of grasslands of the Flooding Pampa region. Consequently, we asked two questions: (1) does the application of glyphosate affect the size, composition and diversity of the seed bank of these grasslands; and (2) to what extent does seed bank determine the vegetation composition of grassland communities affected by glyphosate application? Location Temperate-humid grassland of Flooding Pampa region, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Method We studied paddocks dominated by native grassland on a commercial livestock farm. Glyphosate is usually applied in late summer to promote winter annual grasses in native grasslands. We chose three paddocks that had never been exposed to any herbicide and three paddocks that had been treated with glyphosate in late summer during the previous 5 years. We extracted soil cores to evaluate seed bank composition from 2007 to 2009 and recorded basal cover of above-ground vegetation from 2008 to 2010 from the upper and the lower position of each paddock. Results Glyphosate treatment caused a dramatic shift in seed bank composition, so that seed densities of cool-season annual grasses increased while cool and warm-season perennial grasses, sedges, legumes and dicotyledonous herbs decreased. Richness and diversity of the seed bank were lower and dominance was higher under the glyphosate treatment. Similarity between the seed bank and floristic composition was higher in glyphosate-treated paddocks in the upper position. Strong correspondences between the seed densities of cool-season annual grasses and species composition of glyphosate-treated paddocks and between the seed densities of cool- and warm-season perennial grasses and legumes with the species composition of untreated paddocks were found. Conclusions Because the seed bank changes in response to glyphosate treatment involved the local extinction of several native perennial species, community restoration of these grasslands would depend mainly on propagule dispersal from adjacent areas. Our results raise awareness of the risks of widespread herbicide application for biodiversity conservation in the last semi-natural habitats in the Pampas grasslands."	24	1	0	0	20	2	30	2013-02-14	WOS:000312159400007	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Do treeherb interactions change with water stress and grazing intensity? Location National Park in a Tunisian arid area (34 degrees 39'N, 9 degrees 48'E). Methods Soil water content, soil nutrient concentration, light intensity and microclimatic data were collected under the canopy and in open areas to evaluate the relative roles of A. tortilis (Forssk.) subsp. raddiana (Savi) trees in structuring vegetation composition and diversity patterns in a arid pseudo-savanna. Data were collected inside and outside Bou Hedma National Park, both during a dry and a wet year. Results In both unprotected and protected areas, the influence of the tree canopy on the herbaceous strata can be considered as positive, even though it is more significant inside the park. This positive interaction increased with higher abiotic stress conditions and decreased with grazing intensification. Soil nutrients (organic matter, total N, extractable P) and moisture availability was greater under tree canopies than in the open. Species composition of the herb layer also differed between Acacia trees and open areas. Some palatable species were found under trees, and were replaced by less desirable species in the open. Microclimate measurements showed significant differences in light intensity reaching the soil, mean air temperatures and relative humidity. Conclusions These results suggest that the optimal association of climate factors under the canopy would combine with a high soil fertility mediated by litter decomposition to increase plant cover under tree canopies."	34	1	0	0	30	0	37	2012-10-01	WOS:000308373500006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

What is the relative contribution of organic and conventional farming practices to the structuring of arable weed species diversity and different functional groups (legumes, grasses and broad-leaves)? To what extent do arable weed communities differ between regions and farming systems (organic vs conventional)? Location Twenty-six farms in total in northeast Spain (Catalonia) and north Germany (Lower Saxony). Methods We examined the weed flora in paired organic and conventional farms at each locality and assessed diversity components by additive partitioning of species richness (a, beta and ?). Results The weed species composition differed greatly between the two regions. Only 18 of 135 arable weed species were shared. The a-, beta- and ?-diversity of all functional groups was significantly higher under organic farming practices for both regions, indicating an increasing homogenization of local communities by agricultural intensification within each region. beta-diversity contributed most to the total observed species richness in both regions (69.8% and 35.8% on organic and conventional farms, respectively, in Catalonia; and 62.4% and 53.0% on organic and conventional farms, respectively, in Lower Saxony). These results demonstrate the great importance of environmental heterogeneity and of farm-specific differences in agricultural practices for the richness of arable weed species. Conclusions Regardless of the substantial differences in arable weed community composition across regions, our study emphasizes the great importance of organic farming for arable weed species richness. Understanding the patterns and causes of the dissimilarity of local communities appears to be a key factor for species conservation and the development of effective European-wide agri-environmental schemes at landscape and regional scales.

Despite the fact that epiphytic plants form a significant component of these agroecosystems, their removal from the shade trees is commonplace in Latin America. To what extent does the epiphyte community recover from this severe disturbance?Location: Shaded coffee agroecosystem in Veracruz, Mexico (19 degrees 28'03 '' N, 96 degrees 55'58 '' W; 1200 m asl).Methods: We assessed the diversity, biomass and recolonization patterns of vascular epiphytes in shade trees, 8-9 yr after complete epiphyte removal (E-), and in control 'non-removal' sites (E+). In order to evaluate the effects of prior epiphyte removal, all vascular epiphytes were completely removed from 10 trees per treatment (E- and E+); all epiphyte species collected were identified and dry biomass measured.Results: Eight to nine years after removal, epiphyte biomass in the E- shade trees was 35% of that found in the control sites. A total of 55 epiphyte species, belonging to 12 families, were registered; 40 in E-, and 48 in E+. Six species belonging to Bromeliaceae, Orchidaceae, Cactaceae and Araceae accounted for 75% of the biomass in E+ while six species of bromeliads accounted for 76% of the biomass in E-. Some bromeliads proliferated following disturbance; however, ferns showed lower recovery.Conclusions: Epiphyte community recovery, in terms of biomass and diversity, is considerably higher in the coffee plantation than has been previously reported for other tropical ecosystems. Epiphyte recolonization patterns reflected both the abundance of species in the surrounding matrix and certain species-specific traits. For such agroecosytems to function as effective reservoirs of epiphyte diversity, epiphyte stripping should be avoided."	33	0	0	0	31	4	36	2012-02-01	WOS:000299207600010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

A total of 727 plants were monitored over eight years. The results suggest habitat preferences of the studied species that should be considered for their conservation oriented management. Conifers had highest survival and growth in GR, while broad-leaved trees survived better under sparse canopy in MS, but grew tallest in full light.

Vegetation data were analysed with respect to species richness, species composition and response of species traits to disturbance, including morphology, defence mechanisms, clonal growth form and generative reproduction. Species richness was significantly reduced by grazing, but the percentage of typical fen species or Red Data Book species was not affected by land use type. Detrended Corrspondence Analysis indicated that species composition could best be explained in terms of a land use gradient. Species traits showed a clear trend in their response to land use type. Grazing favoured grasses and small forbs. Only a few species with defence mechanisms against foraging were more frequent or abundant on pastures. Many other species with defence mechanisms, however, did not have an advantage on pastures. Flowering and seed dispersal traits did not respond significantly to grazing or mowing. Species with fast spreading stem derived clonal organs were favoured on pastures, whereas all other clonal growth forms and, particularly, non-clonal species were more abundant on meadows. More indicator species of wet soil conditions and species adapted to flooding were found on pastures.

The highest vascular plant richness was attained during the secondary succession after sod-cutting, where species established on exposed bare ground. Less severe disturbances by burning and cutting also caused a slight increase in the number of vascular plant species. For bryophytes and lichens, the highest increase in the number of species was also found in the sod-cut plots, where all cryptogams were removed by the disturbance. At the scale of 3 in X 3 m, species richness of both vascular plants and cryptogams peaked in 1995-1996, i.e. 3-4 yrs after the disturbance, and slowly decreased or slightly fluctuated without any trend thereafter. At smaller scales it either peaked later or constantly increased over the entire observation period of 9 yrs. Species mobility, expressed as species accumulation over time, was lower than reported from grasslands.

Habitat fragmentation affects both plants and pollinators. Habitat fragmentation leads to changes in species richness, population number and size, density, and shape, thus to changes in the spatial arrangement of flowers. These changes influence the amount of food for flower-visiting insects and the quantity and quality of pollinations. Seed set in small populations is often reduced and genetic variation is expected but not always found to be low. The majority of studies show that low flower densities have reduced pollination success and higher inbreeding. Density effects are stronger than size effects. Most studies concluded that species richness in flower-visiting insects is directly related to richness in plant species. However, the consequences of low insect species richness for pollination are not always clear, depending on the studied pollinator-plant relationship. The effects of the presence of simultaneously flowering species are highly dependent on the circumstances and may range from competition to facilitation. Other flowering plant species may play a role as stepping stones or corridor in the connection between populations. In the absence of stepping stones even short distances between populations act as strong barriers for gene flow. We illustrate the present review paper with own data collected for three plant species, rare in The Netherlands: Phyteuma spicatum ssp. nigrum (Campanulaceae), Salvia pratensis (Labiatae) and Scabiosa columbaria (Dipsacaceae). The species differ in their breeding systems and in the assemblage of visitor species. Data are shown on the effects of population size on species richness with consequences for seed set. Effects of flower density and isolation on pollen exchange are given. Since plant reproduction depends on the behaviour of individual insects and not on the overall behaviour of the species, the examples all point to individual insects and extrapolate to effects at the species level."	163	3	0	0	134	3	180	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

The sensitivity of riparian vegetation to climate and other abiotic factors depends on interactions between properties of the ecosystem, like flood regime, and plant characteristics. To explore these interactions, we addressed three questions: (a) does the composition and diversity of riparian vegetation vary with the flood regime; (b) do abiotic correlates of vegetation, including climate and groundwater, differ between sites that flood compared to locations that did not experience floods; and (c) which plant functional groups account for differential plant community sensitivity to abiotic factors between flood regimes? Location Middle Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico. Methods We used long-term observations of plant community composition, groundwater depth, precipitation and interpolated temperature from 24 sites spanning 210 km of the Rio Grande riparian cottonwood-willow forest to explore the relative importance of climate and hydrologic correlates of riparian vegetation diversity and composition. Results Riparian plant diversity was higher at sites flooding compared to non-flooding sites. Plant diversity positively tracked shallower groundwater depth at flooding sites, but was best predicted by intra-annual groundwater variability at non-flooding sites. Plant community composition correlated with groundwater depth and air temperature at all sites, but at non-flooding sites, also with intra-annual groundwater variability and precipitation. Relationships between native plant cover and potential environmental drivers diverged strongly between the two flood regimes; non-native plant cover had only weak relationships with most environmental predictors. Conclusions The current flood regime of a site determined the climate and hydrologic factors that best predicted riparian plant community composition and diversity. Relationships between plant diversity or total cover and groundwater, temperature, precipitation, or groundwater variability can change in strength or direction depending on a site's flood history, highlighting the importance of flood regime to predicting the sensitivity of riparian woodlands to future environmental change."	3	1	0	0	2	0	4	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000020	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Can this information discriminate between two coastal areas with low (LP) and high (HP) human pressure?Location Tyrrhenian coast, Central Italy.Methods By processing UAS images, we derived the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and topographic variables at high spatial resolution (0.5 m) for 150 m wide strips starting from the coastline inland on two representative coastal tracts under low and high human pressure. We mapped the sea-inland heterogeneity applying Rao's Q index to the plant biomass (NDVI) and geomorphology variables (elevation and slope). Since Rao's Q index can be calculated in a multidimensional space, we summarized the variability of these three variables into a single eco-geomorphological layer. We then inspected and compared how the Rao's Q index values for plant biomass, geomorphology and eco-geomorphology change as a function of the distance from the sea between the two coastal sites.Results Rao's Q heterogeneity values vary along the sea-inland gradient of well-preserved sites (LP). The maximum eco-geomorphological heterogeneity was found at intermediate distances from the sea and decreased toward the inner sector where the dune geomorphology was more stable and vegetation more homogeneously distributed. Instead, Rao's Q heterogeneity values featured constant low values along the gradient on the HP site, highlighting a simplified eco-geomorphological gradient related to the high human pressure.Conclusions Using UAS, the eco-geomorphological gradient of coastal dunes can be quantified at a very fine spatial resolution over management-relevant extents. Rao's Q index applied to sensing imagery successfully captured the differences in the eco-geomorphological heterogeneity along the sea-inland dune gradient and among sites with different levels of anthropic pressure.

Using a series of wetlands as a case study, we ask: (i) will protecting sites based on species rarity capture all critical community types; (ii) do rare plant species occur in rare environments; and (iii) will safeguarding large wetlands protect taxonomic and functional richness of rare and threatened species?Location: Southern New Zealand.Methods: We used lists of vascular plant species from 118 wetlands (66 fens, 35 bogs and 17 marshes). The resulting species lists included 29 rare and threatened species. Nine functional attributes of the rare and threatened species were compiled. Species assemblages were ordinated using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Permutational multivariate ANOVA tested for a difference in assemblages between wetlands with or without rare and threatened species. Wetlands were classified according to a rare environment scheme. SLOSS (single-large-or-several-small) accumulation curves determined whether species and functional richness of rare and threatened species were best captured by groups of small or large wetlands.Results: Wetlands with rare and threatened species supported species assemblages, which were different from those without rare or threatened plant species. Rare and threatened species were not associated with rare environments. The presence or richness of rare and threatened species was not associated with wetland size. SLOSS analyses revealed that small wetlands were critical for capturing rare and threatened species and their functional richness.Conclusions: Prioritizing wetlands with rare and threatened plant species will not meet other conservation objectives, such as the preservation of all critical community types, rare environments or large wetlands. Networks of small wetlands will be necessary to safeguard rare and threatened plant species. Complementary objectives targeted at wetlands of varying size will be necessary to protect the full range of biodiversity and ecosystem services that wetlands offer."	40	7	0	0	31	1	49	2015-04-01	WOS:000352131500008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

In 2011, we repeated this study within three long-term grazing treatments that were established in 1948. Ten transects were established in each treatment to quantify the frequency and cover of live and dead woody individuals for all woody species. Rates of woody plant dieback were determined for each species and tested for differences among height classes, soil categories, total woody densities and pastoral treatments.ResultsFlash droughts (defined as rapidly intensifying droughts characterized by moisture deficits and high temperatures) from 2000 to 2011 were the second most severe since 1919 (low PDSI=-4) and were only surpassed by the prolonged drought from 1951 to 1957 (low PDSI=-5.17). Drought-induced shifts from one woody plant community to another did not occur uniformly across the landscape. Instead, high mortality rates of mature Juniperus ashei trees in deep soils (67.3%, 33 of 49 trees), combined with the recruitment of Quercus species where grazing had been excluded for the last 60yr, were the only patch types to shift from a Juniperus-Quercus woodland to an alternate state.ConclusionsFlash droughts since 2000 resulted in significant mortality and dieback, but dieback in cover was 28% higher following the more severe drought of the 1950s. Legacies from long-term land management practices interacted with localized differences in topoedaphic factors to drive patch-level shifts in woody vegetation following drought."	37	0	0	0	29	0	52	2014-01-22	WOS:000328544400006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Shade-tolerant herbs were subdivided into ancient forest species (AFS) and other shade-tolerant species (OSS). Effects of clear-felling on species number per plot, total cover per plot and colonization rate of species groups were compared using non-parametrical tests. Species number per plot was modelled by means of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), with inventory time, distance to the nearest parcel edge, and cover of light-loving species (LS) as explanatory variables. The C-S-R signature (competitive, stress-tolerant and ruderal strategies, respectively) shift of sample plots was calculated on the selected shade-tolerant species.ResultsFrequency of most species increased during the 10-yr period. Number of OSS increased more and faster than that of AFS. OSS increased to the level of the adjacent forest, but was lower where LS cover remained high. There was a positive correlation between the change of the colonization rate and the competitive plant strategy.ConclusionsWe assume that clear-felling stimulated generative reproduction of shade-tolerant herbs, whereas quickly emerging woody species controlled competitive exclusion by LS. Succession of dark and light phases, such as provided by an understorey managed as a coppice, could promote colonization of shade-tolerant herbs into post-agricultural forest."	22	0	0	0	21	0	22	2011-02-01	WOS:000286207100008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

The decline of metallophyte vegetation in floodplain grasslands: Implications for conservation and restoration	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	12	1	NA	NA	69	80	NA	10.1111/j.1654-109X.2009.01005.x	Article	FEB 2009	2009	"Question: Which biogeochemical processes are responsible for the decline of endemic metallophyte vegetation in floodplain grasslands?Location: Floodplain grasslands along the River Geul (the Netherlands) and metalliferous mine spoils near the River Geul (Belgium).Methods: In order to find factors and soil processes that have caused a decline of metallophytes and an increase of pseudo-metallophytes in floodplain grasslands, a soil study was done at locations currently and formerly dominated by metallophytes. In addition, changes in soil chemistry in recent decades in floodplain grasslands were investigated. Finally, a 2-year plant growth experiment was performed in the field, to test the effects of improving soil conditions by topsoil removal.Results: Metallophytes only Occur on acidic floodplain soils (pH-H2O 5.0-5.5) with relatively high Zn availability (total Zn>40 mu molg(-1); Zn/Ca>0.8; Zn-H2O>59 mu mol kg(-1)) combined with low phosphate availability (Olsen-P << 1250 mu mol kg(-1)). The Olsen-P and total Ca concentrations were relatively high in topsoil (0-20 cm), while total Zn was high throughout the soil profile (0-50 cm). Removal of topsoil led to recovery of P and Zn availability. Under the new soil conditions there was almost no growth and expansion of pseudo-metalliferous grasses in time, wheras metallophytes easily established, maintained and reproduced with significant increases in cover over time.Conclusions: On a global scale, metallophyte vegetation types are increasingly under threat of extinction. Our Study shows that factors leading to higher soil alkalinity inhibit Zn availability at the expense of the metallophyte vegetation. Factors leading to a higher Olsen-P concentration stimulate the growth of more competitive pseudo-metallophyte grasses. Both eutrophication and alkalinisation have contributed to the decline of metallophyte vegetation in floodplains of the River Geul. Removal of the alkaline- and phosphate-enriched soil top layer restores the original soil chemistry and enables re-colonisation by the metallophyte vegetation. The results can be applied in conservation and restoration strategies for such sites."	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2009-02-01	WOS:000265846400008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Given that a comprehensive understanding of regeneration dynamics is critical to designating appropriate management interventions we ask the following: how does regeneration, vis-a-vis the buried seed bank, vary in heterogenous urban forests? And, can forest patch size be used to predict regeneration and consequent management interventions?Location Vacant lots and public parks throughout New Haven, CT, USA.Methods We sampled buried seed banks in 131 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes ranging from large intact parks (95-126 ha), to small parks (1-19 ha), and vacant lots (0.05-0.65 ha). We collected soil samples from the surface mineral soil and stratified them over sand in a greenhouse over a period of five months to record germination.Results By examining seed bank floristics in a range of forest patch sizes we found that species composition, nativity, and dominance of specific functional groups shifted with patch size representing a spectrum of urbanization within just one city. Seed bank floristics in large parks more closely resembled results from seed bank studies in rural forests with over 85% native germinants on average. In contrast, vacant lots were dominated by non-native germinants and more ruderal species indicative of earlier successional stages. Seed banks in small parks were variable and in some cases were more similar to large parks or vacant lots.Conclusions Our findings suggest that large parks in urban areas may be largely self-sustaining whereas smaller parks may require more intensive management for site rehabilitation, especially in early states of succession. Furthermore, our results confirm the highly heterogenous nature of urban forest patches and call for more systematic sampling of urban areas to capture this variation and improve management prescriptions and outcomes."	10	0	0	0	5	0	10	2020-11-04	WOS:000581126800001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Our question is whether spatial distribution (regeneration microsite) of oak recruits is determined by different biotic and abiotic stress agents and whether recruits of co-occurring oak species may respond differently to each source of stress.Location Mediterranean California mixed oak woodlands.Methods We recorded the main regeneration microsites of four co-occurring oak species (Quercus lobata, Q. douglasii, Q. kelloggii and Q. agrifolia) in 25 belt transects in a nature reserve and identified the main stress agent for each species and microsite. We also analyzed their response to stress through physiological parameters (chlorophyll, flavonol, anthocyanin and nitrogen).Results Q. agrifolia and Q. lobata seedlings mostly established under shrubs and trees, respectively. The other species did not have a prime regeneration microsite. Biotic stress occurred more frequently than abiotic (drought) stress for all species. Regarding biotic sources of stress, the deciduous Q. lobata, Q. douglasii and Q. kellogii showed high browsing damage; insect damage was light and occurred mostly in the evergreen Q. agrifolia whereas fungal damage was significantly lower in Q. douglasii. Physiologically, all oak species responded similarly to stress agents although Q. douglasii and Q. kelloggii showed higher chlorophyll content than Q. agrifolia and Q. lobata, which might be related to differences in resilience.Conclusions Deciduous oaks are particularly vulnerable to overgrazing whereas the evergreen Q. agrifolia seems more affected by fungal and insect damage. Management aimed at the co-existence of deciduous and evergreen oaks should consider the enhancement of microsites that best ameliorate the impact of predicted stress agents but also the oak physiological responses (i.e. resilience) to each stress agent. We suggest keeping low ungulate densities and carefully consider the species selection in assisted regeneration projects depending on the predominant stress agent and microsite."	3	1	0	0	4	0	4	2020-11-04	WOS:000581128200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

LAI data from hemispherical photography (images post-processed with Can-eye software) were taken as reference values. Plants were clustered on the basis of leaf type and canopy structure.ResultsIn general, PocketLAI showed satisfactory performances in the case of broad-leaf plants (R-2=0.78, P<0.001) for all shrub and tree clusters. On the other hand, poor results were obtained for conifers (R-2=0.16), likely because of the unfavourable leaf area to perimeter ratio. Best performances were observed for dense broad-leaf canopies characterized by a regular arrangement of crowns (R-2=0.95 for row-planted trees, R-2=0.87 for tall forest trees), although satisfying results were achieved also in the case of canopies made irregular and non-homogeneous by pruning (R-2=0.73 for small fruit trees). Concerning shrubs, the agreement between PocketLAI and hemispherical photography was higher for species with big leaves (R-2=0.72).ConclusionsThese results suggest that PocketLAI can be an alternative to other methods in case of broad-leaf woody species, especially in contexts where resources and portability are key issues, whereas further improvements are required for conifers."	21	2	0	0	7	0	24	2015-09-30	WOS:000361181500017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

What is the precision and accuracy of available indicators? Location Rich fen and alkaline spring areas in Denmark. Methods Potential indicators of conservation status were evaluated based on: accuracy, measured as the ability to predict the number of typical species in monitoring plots; precision, measured as variation over years of indicators in repeated plots; and cost of obtaining data for the indicator. Indicators were derived using data from the Danish National Monitoring and Assessment Programme for the Aquatic and Terrestrial Environment from 2000 to 2009. Indicators included biotic indices derived from species lists, abiotic measurements of pH and nutrients and structural measurements of vegetation height and tree cover. Results The majority of indicators showed a significant correlation with the number of typical species. Floristic indicators, especially based on Ellenberg nutrient values, showed superior correlation and were furthermore very stable over years. Structural indicators were generally accurate, but were highly imprecise with high between-year variation. Among the abiotic indicators, pH and soil P were inaccurate, whereas tissue N content and nitrate in water were accurate but with low precision. When balancing efficiency of indicators with monitoring costs, laboratory analyses stand out as expensive compared to recording of a species list, the latter providing up to five valuable indicators. Conclusions Floristic indicators derived from Ellenberg values, and especially those related to nutrient availability, are cost-effective indicators of conservation status. The method is applicable to all regions where Ellenberg indicator values have been calibrated to fit local conditions."	20	0	0	0	17	0	20	2013-07-01	WOS:000319885000014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Plant communities in buffer strips were surveyed in 29 sampling sites. Using ArcGIS Desktop 9.0 (ArcInfo) and Fragstats 3.3 for GIS analysis, the landscape composition around each sampling site was characterized by seven parameters in square sectors at five scales: 4, 36, 100, 196, and 324 ha. For each scale, Principle Component Analysis was used to examine the importance of each structural metric to diversity indicators using multiple regression and other simple analyses.Results: For all but the smallest scales (4 ha), two structural metrics including the diversity of land cover types and percentage of arable land were positively and negatively correlated with species richness, respectively. Both metrics had the highest correlation coefficients for species richness at the second largest scale (196 ha). The density of arable field edges between the fields was the only metric that correlated with species evenness for all scales, which had highest predictive power at the second smallest scale (36 ha).Conclusions: Species richness and evenness of buffer strips had scale-dependent relationships to land use in agricultural ecosystems. The results of this study indicated that species richness depends on the pattern of arable land use at large scales, which may relate to the regional species pool. Meanwhile, species evenness depended on the level of field edge density at small scales, which relates to how the nearby farmland was divided by the edges (e. g. many small-scale fields with high edge density or a few big-scale fields with low edge density).

We evaluated attributes related to the composition and structure, dimensions of each tree, and environmental variables, aiming to understand the mechanisms of plant community assembly.ResultsNurse trees play an important role in the assembly of the plant community, promoting changes in abiotic (provide shade, increased litter, decreased exposed soil) and biotic (decreased herbaceous abundance) conditions. Consequently, they provide microhabitat for herbaceous and woody plants. These tree species are decisive in the assembly of the plant community in park grassland, and their conservation is fundamental for the maintenance of associated species.

Linear landscape elements play an important role in providing refuge for plants and pollinators, as well as serving as biological corridors. The aim of this study was to assess the importance of road verges in maintaining the ecological connectivity of plant species assemblages in the Tandilia mountain system.LocationSouth America, Southern Pampa region of Argentina, Tandilia mountain system.MethodsUsing graph theory, landscape connectivity was quantified both at landscape scale and at the patch scale using the probability connectivity index (PCnum), taking into account the dispersal ability of observed species. The contribution of each landscape element to habitat availability and connectivity was evaluated using different fractions of the PCnum metric. Likewise, the influence of connectivity variables in explaining species assemblages grouped by functional categories was investigated using canonical ordination techniques.ResultsThe inclusion of road verges led to an 81% increase in overall connectivity at a threshold distance of 500 m. Connectivity significantly explained the assemblages of entomophilous plant species for all dispersal distances. Annual species assemblage variation was associated with intra-patch connectivity. Variation in perennial and shrub species assemblages was explained by intra-patch and inter-patch connectivity.ConclusionsPreservation and restoration of these linear landscape elements play a pivotal role in transitioning toward more sustainable agroecosystems. This ecological and practical information may help prioritize plant species and the sites used to restore an essential but neglected ecosystem.In Argentina's Southern Pampa, our study highlights the importance of road verges for maintaining functional connectivity. We found that the inclusion of road verges increases the connectivity and maintains biodiversity in fragmented agricultural landscapes.

We asked whether there were differences in edge effects between two types (3 m vs 8 m width) of low-severity linear disturbance (seismic lines) and whether there were interactions of edge effects when seismic lines occur in dense networks; that is, do multiple narrow seismic lines have a stronger or weaker edge influence than a single narrow seismic line.Location: Treed peatlands in northeastern Alberta, Canada.Methods: Seismic lines are created during oil and gas exploration and are responsible for dissection of boreal forests in western Canada. We sampled vascular plants along transects perpendicular to seismic lines in moderate-rich and poor treed fens. We used the Randomization Test of Edge Influence (RTEI) to calculate the magnitude and distance of edge effects and then compared these between narrower (3 m) versus wider (8 m) lines and between single narrow lines versus multiple narrow lines (parallel and similar to 50 m apart).Results: In moderate-rich fens, we found a positive edge influence on understorey diversity from both wide and narrow seismic lines. We also found a weakening edge interaction on diversity, that is, single narrow seismic lines had a stronger edge influence on diversity than did multiple narrow seismic lines. In treed poor fens, multiple narrow seismic lines had a negative edge effect on tree density, understorey abundance, richness, and composition. In addition, we found strengthening edge interactions in treed poor fens on tree density, graminoid cover, and understorey composition.Conclusions: Even narrow linear disturbances, such as seismic lines, can have significant edge effects and these are exacerbated when lines occur in dense networks."	9	0	0	0	6	0	9	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Are montane road verges conduits of exotic species' dispersal into adjacent, undisturbed hinterland? Location: Montane grassland, Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area, South Africa.Methods: We surveyed road verge and adjacent hinterland transects (25 x 2 m; N = 80) across an elevational gradient of 1,500-2,874 m a.s.l. in 2007 and 2017. In each transect, we estimated the cover of each exotic plant species and the total cover of indigenous species. Generalised Linear Models were fitted to test if exotic species' richness and cover had changed over time. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis was used to determine if exotic species' composition had changed over time.Results: Ten years onwards, exotic species richness had increased significantly across the entire elevational gradient, predominantly in the low-to mid-elevational range. Road verge and adjacent hinterland transects differed in species composition in 2007, but no longer in 2017.Conclusion: Exotic species richness and composition displayed a high spatiotemporal rate of change. Over time, exotic species increasingly moved into the hinterland from the verges as a result of human-mediated colonisation pressure. These results indicate that montane road verges are far better conduits for the dispersal of exotic species than previously assumed, and that further colonisation of the hinterland by exotics can be expected."	11	0	0	0	10	0	11	2022-03-21	WOS:000764250300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

What impact do these species have on plant communities? To what extent are changes driven by anthropogenically induced drivers such as disturbance, eutrophication and management? Location Great Britain. Methods Data from national surveys were used to assess changes in the frequency and abundance of selected weed species between 1978 and 2007. This involved novel method development to create indices of change, and to relate changes in distribution and abundance of these species to plant community diversity and inferred changes in resource availability, disturbance and management. Results Three of the six weed species became more widespread in GB over this period and all of them increased in abundance (in grasslands, arable habitats, roadsides and streamsides). Patterns were complex and varied by landscape context and habitat type. For most of the species, there were negative relationships between abundance, total plant species richness, grassland, wetland and woodland indicators. Each individual species responds to a different combination of anthropogenic drivers but disturbance, fertility and livestock management significantly influenced most species. Conclusions The increase in frequency and abundance of weeds over decades has implications for landscape-scale plant diversity, fodder yield and livestock health. This includes reductions in plant species richness, loss of valuable habitat specialists and homogenisation of vegetation communities. Increasing land-use intensity, excessive nutrient input, overgrazing, sward damage, poaching and bare ground in fields and undermanagement or too frequent cutting on linear features may have led to increases in weeds. These weeds do have conservation value so we are not advocating eradication, rather co-existence, without dominance. Land management policy needs to adapt to benefit biodiversity and agricultural productivity."	11	0	0	0	8	0	11	2020-09-03	WOS:000561705100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

What are the locations, spatial extents and magnitudes of these effects?LocationThe 8500-ha Sylvania Wilderness Area, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, USA.MethodsWe conducted vegetation surveys in 202 plots in ten transects crossing the Sylvania Wilderness border in 2013 and 2014. We recorded characteristics of forest structure, trees, shrubs, saplings, seedlings and herbaceous species. We constructed GLMM to estimate the location, spatial extent and magnitude of change of edge effects on Sylvania with a range of possible edge effect locations and widths of effect. We selected best-fit models that minimized the AIC and applied likelihood ratio tests to assess the statistical significance of each edge effect.ResultsOverall, evidence of edge effects occurred up to 625m into the Sylvania Wilderness, with most significant changes occurring within 400m of the wilderness border. Wide zones of change occurred across the wilderness border, while zones of change farther from the edge tended to be narrower, suggesting that distinct environments are established beyond the transitional habitats surrounding the border region. Canopy-level and understorey-level variables exhibited the largest magnitudes and steepest gradients of change, indicating these communities are strongly influenced by edge effects in this forest system. Canopy-level heterogeneity also increased approaching the internal core area of Sylvania.ConclusionsIn this case study, we applied a linear change point model and found a minimum buffer zone of 400m to mitigate edge effects in an old-growth temperate mixed forest. Regionally, land managers could implement this buffer to existing edges of protected areas or negotiate this buffer zone in land acquisitions. A more stringent buffer zone of 625m internal and 250m external to old-growth forests would be ideal. This application of change point analysis provides a simple, efficient method to establish effective buffer zones and to identify functional groups or ecosystem attributes for which edge effects are of greatest conservation concern. We recommend modifying our open-source change point package to estimate local edge effects that take into account regional characteristics."	2	2	0	0	1	0	4	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Is the recruitment of such species also limited in tree-planted riparian zones by local filters such as competition, shade level and soil conditions?LocationTwo agricultural watersheds, southeastern Quebec, Canada.MethodsThree herbs characteristic of natural riparian forests were selected for this study: one graminoid, Glyceria striata, and two ferns, Matteuccia struthiopteris and Onoclea sensibilis. Effects of shade level (75% vs 50%) and soil type (forest vs agricultural soil) on seedling emergence were evaluated in a seed-sowing greenhouse experiment. In a 2-yr transplant field experiment, seedling and sporophyte establishment was monitored in five natural riparian forests and five tree-planted post-agricultural riparian zones on microsites with understorey vegetation kept intact or cleared and on forest or agricultural soils. Using a priori contrasts, we assessed the influence of habitat type (natural riparian forests or tree-planted riparian zones), competition and post-agricultural soil type on transplant survival and growth.ResultsSeedling emergence tended to be higher on forest soils for G.striata while sporophyte emergence increased under 75% shade for M.struthiopteris. Transplanted seedlings and sporophytes of the three species survived and grew as well in tree-planted riparian zones as in natural riparian forests. In tree-planted riparian zones however, competing understorey vegetation reduced the survival and growth of G.striata and agricultural soil reduced the growth of M.struthiopteris. For O.sensibilis, only sporophyte survival was reduced by competition in tree-planted riparian zones.ConclusionsPlanting trees in post-agricultural riparian zones fosters establishment of forest herbs similar than those observed in natural riparian forests. Additional environmental filters specific to tree-planted riparian zones, however, offset the positive influence of trees and limit recolonization of the three studied species. Considering the partial restoration success of establishment niches by tree planting, controlling spontaneous vegetation after tree planting is advised when conceivable and cost-effective to promote the recolonization of environmentally-limited forest herbs. Long-term transplant experiments should be more often conducted to identify the ecological filters that reduce plant recolonization, and thereby design the most effective restoration strategies."	6	0	0	0	6	0	6	2016-10-01	WOS:000386136600014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Location Madrid Autonomous Region, Central Spain. Methods We selected four study localities in different landscape units. Within each locality, we selected eight sites and within each site, we established three 1-ha plots, each corresponding to one of three situations: drove road, adjacent matrix or distant matrix. The landscape pattern of each plot was characterized by the cover of the different patch types, the patch type richness ha-1 and the patch type evenness ha-1. At one site per locality, we also recorded vegetation by randomly distributing twenty 20cmx20cm quadrats per plot. We characterized each quadrat by its species richness, plant species composition and plant functional composition. We also analysed species richness by constructing rarefaction curves for each plot. Results In the localities situated in croplands, sub-mediterranean forests and coniferous forests, drove roads were found to be an important source of spatial heterogeneity and a reservoir for a large number of plant species. In contrast, drove roads did not differ from the matrix habitats in rangelands, suggesting that the processes shaping drove road vegetation are similar to the general processes that shape grazed systems. Drove roads did not imply a significant increase in functional diversity. Our results were heavily scale-dependent: while drove roads provided heterogeneity at the local scale, they showed a remarkable similarity at the large scale. Conclusions Drove roads act as authentic local biodiversity reservoirs, especially in environments with low grazing levels. At the same time, drove roads imply structural and functional continuity on a large scale, increasing potential connectivity at the regional level. We recommend the preservation of drove roads in a functional state, because of their benefits to plant biodiversity conservation, and claim that these benefits should be considered when designing livestock policies with different intensification scenarios."	23	0	0	0	19	0	26	2013-07-01	WOS:000319885000013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Six collections were carried out over the rice cultivation cycle. Richness and biomass were measured using the quadrat method.Results: A total of 88 macrophyte species was recorded. There was no statistical interaction between management practices and rice cultivation phases for macrophyte richness and biomass. Macrophyte species richness and biomass changed over time, but were similar between flooded and dry rice fields. The first three axes generated by detrended correspondence analysis explained 29% of the variation in species composition and the multivariate analysis of variance showed that there was a statistical interaction between management practices and agricultural periods.Conclusions: Rice fields may help to conserve an important fraction of the aquatic macrophyte diversity of wetlands of southern Brazil by providing the setting up of a greater number of species within the agricultural landscape. However, rice fields must not be viewed as surrogate systems for natural wetlands. The difference in species composition between flooded and dry rice fields is interesting in terms of biodiversity conservation. If rice producers could keep part of their agricultural land flooded during the fallow phase, this management practice could be an important strategy for the conservation of biodiversity in areas where natural wetlands have been converted to rice fields."	25	0	0	0	21	3	25	2010-02-01	WOS:000273601700003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Species composition differed highly among landscapes, with HDL being the most dissimilar landscape. The response of lianas to landscape spatial pattern differed significantly among landscapes. Proximity to villages had a strong positive effect on species and stem densities in LDL and IDL. There was a sharp decrease in liana stein density in HDL, with four patches (27%) found to be unoccupied by lianas.Conclusions: Fragmentation may have a positive effect oil lianas, partly because of edge effects.

A greenhouse experiment assessed the limits imposed on plant growth in fly ash.Results: The fly ash was saline, slightly alkaline and very poor in organic matter and nitrogen. Ash from bare and vegetated areas differed significantly in their salinity and extractable concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and various metals. Bare ash had a significantly higher conductivity and extractable sodium. aluminum. manganese, potassium. and lead. In total I I plant species that belonged to seven families were found growing on the fly ash: all species except the shrub Tamarix chinensis were herbaceous. Using discriminant analysis, the most important factors in distinguishing bare and vegetated ashes were conductivity and sodium. Cluster analysis of bare samples gave two distinct groups, one from the periphery of the lagoon. which had lower sodium, conductivity, organic carbon, potassium and copper. and the other from a second group that contained ashes from the central region of the lagoon.

Five years later, we measured numbers of vascular plant species and transmitted light in replicated 100-m(2) plots. Treatments involved three different overstorey conditions: no overstorey for 5 years, no overstorey for several decades, and overstorey pines present for decades.Results: Both recent and long-term openings contained, on average, about 100 vascular plant species per 100 m(2), 20% more than in similar-sized areas beneath overstorey trees.

A better understanding of species-area relationships in coastal sandy patches (i.e., beaches and dunes) is valuable for designing effective management strategies for the conservation of beach-dune flora in coastal regions. We investigated how the area and other attributes of sandy patches affect the number of species (dune, inland, and alien species) and whether the occurrence of all dune species is area-dependent. Location Sandy coast of San'in Kaigan National Park, western Japan. Methods All vascular plants at 43 sites (sandy patches) were recorded. Using generalized linear models, we analyzed the relationships of the area and other attributes of sandy patches with the number of species and the relationship between the area of sandy patches and the occurrence (presence/absence) of each dune species. Results Larger sandy patches maintained a greater number of dune species and harbored some nationally threatened ones. The number of inland and alien species also increased with an increasing area of sandy patches, although the effects of other size and site attributes varied; shoreline length, beach-dune height, and high openness of the beach were selected as important positive factors for the number of dune species. Furthermore, most dune species in herb and dwarf shrub zones were area-dependent and tended to occur in larger sandy patches, whereas some species of the tidal drift zone, including locally threatened dune species, were area-independent. Conclusions Effective conservation of beach-dune flora demands not only the protection of larger sandy patches but also the selective preservation of sandy patches with better developed dunes. Moreover, the maintenance of unstable habitats for area-independent dune species is important."	7	0	0	0	6	0	7	2019-08-02	WOS:000476385900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Then, we carried out a PCA in order to identify the differences in life forms and environmental variables across the treatments.ResultsPAR(i) and pH were statistically significantly higher in US, while EC and RH were statistically significantly higher in SPS. Diversity indices did not differ significantly among the non-afforested steppe (US) and the patches between crowns (BC), but were significantly higher in both these treatments than below the crown (UC). The higher richness in some of the life forms and light availability clearly separated US from UC in the PCA. All the species of interest (endemic, N-fixing, medicinal, fodder) were found in the SPS.ConclusionsOur study indicates that the changes in site variables produced by low-density afforestation generate niches for some species and, simultaneously, constitute a barrier to others. However, the fact that diversity indices and the presence of the species of interest showed no differences among the between-crowns patches and the non-afforested steppe, highlights the complex environment-vegetation relationships that take place in this kind of system."	11	1	0	0	10	2	13	2018-09-04	WOS:000442660900009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Determinants of canopy gap characteristics in rehabilitating coastal dune forests	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	21	3	NA	NA	451	460	NA	10.1111/avsc.12380	Article	JUL 2018	2018	"QuestionsWhat drives canopy gap formation in regenerating coastal dune forest? Does canopy gap size frequency distribution differ between new and old-growth forests? Can canopy gaps divert regenerating trajectories?LocationRehabilitating coastal dune forest, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.MethodsWe mapped canopy gaps in regenerating dune forest patches of varying age, which develop after seeding of the pioneer Vachellia kosiensis, and a reference forest by means of unsupervised classification of multi-spectral satellite images. We tested if gap formation can be explained by abiotic (exposure to winds) and/or biotic (tree density at early stages) variables. We calculated the scaling exponent of a power-law model to quantify if gap size frequency differed between new and old-growth forests. Finally, we measured canopy openness, tree height and number of stems to validate canopy gap classification and assess the consequences of canopy gaps on regenerating trajectories.ResultsExposure to winds and tree density at early stages were both significant predictors of gap presence. Gaps were more likely to be present along dune ridges and areas with low tree density than valleys and areas with high tree density at early stages. Large gaps were common in both new and old-growth forests. The scaling exponent was positively related to regeneration age, indicating a reduction in gap size as the forest aged. Areas with open canopies had shorter individual trees that were more likely to be multi-stemmed than areas with closed canopies.ConclusionCanopy gaps are an important component of new and old-growth coastal dune forests dynamics. Although gaps are filled during forest development, changes in individual life-history strategies and morphology may alter regeneration trajectories. However, because their effect is partly controlled by the exposure to wind and tree density at early stages, it can also be manipulated by management to ensure nucleation, which could accelerate forest recovery."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2018-09-04	WOS:000442660900010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

"Distance, environmental and substrate factors impacting recovery of bryophyte communities after harvesting"	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	21	1	NA	NA	64	75	NA	10.1111/avsc.12343	Article	JAN 2018	2018	"AimsBryophyte re-colonization after disturbance is largely governed by environmental conditions within disturbed forests. In particular, distance to a forest edge is an important predictor of bryophyte community re-colonization, through either direct constraints, such as dispersal limitation, or indirectly by altering environmental conditions. This study examines a range of factors - environmental, distance to an edge, substrate specific environment or local-level environment - to determine which are important in the re-colonization of bryophyte communities after forest harvesting. As bryophyte communities vary with the particular substrate inhabited, responses were examined across four substrates (rock, exposed roots, ground and CWD).LocationTasmanian southern forests, Australia.MethodsBryophyte composition was examined on four substrates (ground, coarse wood debris, exposed roots, rocks) within three ages (similar to 7, similar to 27 and similar to 45years post-disturbance) of harvested wet eucalypt forest. Re-colonization success of bryophyte communities was determined by comparing communities in regeneration forest to mature forest communities using axis scores from one-dimensional constrained ordination. The importance of various environmental conditions for re-colonization success was then modelled. Finally, path analysis was used to determine whether the impact of distance to a forest edge was meditated through its effects on key environmental variables.ResultsMultiple environmental factors impacted re-colonization of mature bryophyte communities. Local-level conditions such as microclimate (temperature, humidity and VPD) and LAI were the most important in determining re-colonization across substrates. Path analysis showed that distance to a forest edge had a significant impact on re-colonization success, but only a relatively small part of this was mediated through its impact on environmental factors.ConclusionsBryophyte re-colonization is driven by a combination of microclimate conditions and factors related to distance from a forest edge (most likely dispersal distance). While some substrate-specific factors impact bryophyte re-colonization success, the consistent impact of local environmental factors across substrates suggests that harvesting management strategies that develop more mature' microclimate conditions and increase proximity to nearby mature forest patches will be beneficial for all bryophytes communities. As bryophyte re-colonization was correlated with temporally dynamic environmental conditions, we suggest that forest age needs to be considered in future work."	8	1	0	0	6	0	10	2018-03-13	WOS:000425120600008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Consistently, shoot growth of the dominant grasses was most reduced by soil compaction when bigger soil biota were present; the shoot growth of forbs showed an opposite pattern. In contrast, legumes seem to profit from soil compaction independent of the size class of the soil biota community, and were detrimentally affected only in the natural control soil. Establishment of the neophyte L.polyphyllus was best under natural soil conditions and was not affected by soil compaction.Conclusions: A reduction in soil biota size due to intensified management may change the impacts of soil compaction on plant communities. The results indicate that soil compaction has the most detrimental effect on primary productivity in soil communities where a range of size classes of soil biota is present and the functional complexity of the soil biota community is therefore high."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2013-11-01	WOS:000324090800011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Silvicutural treatments were applied in the spring of 2001. A small scale disturbance experiment was initiated in the spring of 2002 (Trial 1) and was replicated again in the spring of 2003 (Trial 2). Experimental hardware cloth exclosures, each containing a control (ambient litter) and experimentally scratched (litter removed to bare soil) compartment, were erected in each management unit (N = 8 exclosures per unit).Results: Acer rubrum, a species that occupies a wide germination niche., produced the most numerous seedlings. Nut-producing species established more readily in compartments with ambient leaf litter, while A. rubrum was unresponsive to scratching treatment. Units burned (surface leaf litter removed at a broad scale) had the lowest rate of seedling recruitment in Trial 1.Conclusions: These data suggest that an adequate cover of leaf litter is needed to promote optimal recruitment.

Five treatments were applied to the transplanted sods: (1) no manipulation; (2) fertilization with NPK to exclude the effect of nutrient limitation; (3) clipping vegetation around the transplant to exclude competition for light; (4) clipping + fertilizing; (5) sods were also transplanted within their own environment.Results: After two seasons, the small-sedge sods transplanted into the high-productive zone had a biomass two times lower than that of the control transplants, mainly due to a decrease in small sedges and bryophytes. Tall sedges of the high-productive zone did not respond significantly to transplantation in the low-productive zone. Removal of the surrounding vegetation largely enhanced the growth of small sedges and bryophytes and, to a lesser degree, of tall sedges. Fertilization, on the other hand, resulted in increased growth of tall sedges, grasses and non-graminoid herbs.Conclusion: Species characteristic of low-productive fen communities are competitively excluded from the high-productive zone through light competition. In contrast, the performance of tall sedges in the low-productive zone is lowered by nutrient limitation. In the long run this may lead to a complete disappearance of these species from this zone. We did not find evidence that the physical stress of flooding has a direct effect on the performance and distribution of species. Results from the experiment suggest that productivity gradients and their influence on competition intensity are of primary importance for structuring vegetation patterns in lowland riparian fens."	54	0	0	0	45	0	57	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Method: Nurse plants of Olea europaea ssp. cuspidata seedlings were recorded using T-square plotless sampling and clustered according to shrub traits, using Ward's method after Principal Components Analysis. Facilitation was further examined through experimental planting and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Results: Both in grazed and protected areas, Olea recruits were found exclusively under shrubs, primarily under Euclea racemosa although Acacia etbaica was more abundant. Olea recruitment is distributed randomly at landscape scale, but depends on shelter at patch scale. Shelter ability is related to shrub shape and species identity. Dense multi-stemmed shrubs with a wide base and crown on a mulch-rich mound are key recruitment foci. Euclea shrubs have these favoured traits and probably act as preferential perching sites for avian seed dispersers. Soil and organic matter accumulation under Euclea shrubs may also create favourable conditions for Olea germination and survival. Experimentally planted seedlings had a better chance for survival under Euclea.Conclusions: Olea regeneration is probably subject to both passive (disperser-mediated) and active facilitation. Small changes of shrub traits can alter the suitability of a patch for Olea recruitment. Protection of shrubs can increase facilitation for seedlings, while pruning may reduce competition for saplings and thus enhance forest succession. Planting of raised Olea seedlings under Euclea shrubs in years with a good rainy season may further assist forest restoration."	33	1	0	0	26	1	35	2006-05-01	WOS:000242292500014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

We also used a 19-year time series of NDV1 PAL data (8km x 8km) to analyze the relationship APAR-precipitation inside and outside the park.Results: The vegetation of the CGNNP absorbed less than 20% of the incoming radiation.

CGNNP showed a well-defined growing season with a unique peak of APAR. Plains and piedmont, covered by annual vegetation displayed an earlier development of the leaf area index than the shrublands and grasslands typical of the other landscapes. APAR had a significant relationship with the sum of the precipitation of the current and two previous growing seasons, except for the Plains.Conclusions: The APAR of the areas more modified by humans (outside the park) showed a lower sensitivity to changes in precipitation than those under protection.

Bogs, economically valuable wetlands, are subjected to exploitation in southern Canada. We addressed plant conservation within bogs mined for peat, in which small undisturbed remnants are left, mostly at the margins of the mined areas. The main goal of the study was to test whether these remnants act as refuges for plants which could recolonize areas that are planned for restoration after mining is completed. Mosses, lichens and vascular plants were sampled in remnants of 24 mined bogs in southeastern Canada during the summer of 1997. The vegetation was also sampled at the margins and centres of 24 nearby natural bogs in plots similar in size to these remnants. Using similarity analysis and ordination techniques, we found that plant species assemblages in remnants of mined bogs differ from those near the margins of natural bogs, and that certain species are associated with the centre of natural bogs, due to the presence of pools. We also showed that water conditions of remnants are affected by drainage due to peat mining. Sphagnum moss showed itself to be a key indicator of mining effects on vegetation.

We aimed to determine the extent and timing of tree and shrub encroachment into rock barrens of eastern Ontario over the last century, and to assess implications for their ongoing management.Location: Queen's University Biological Station in the Frontenac Arch ecoregion.Methods: We quantified the extent of change in woody vegetation in 290 rock barrens using aerial photography from 1925, 1965, and 2008. Composition and structure of woody plant communities in 10 barrens was subsequently quantified in the field using plot-based sampling. Cores or cross-sections were obtained from individuals >1.5 m height and dendrochronological techniques were used to determine their age and identify temporal patterns of any woody encroachment.Results: Aerial photography indicated that the mean proportion of woody plant cover in barrens increased 22.5% from 1925 to 2008. Dendroecological analysis supported this. Few trees were present prior to 1900 and most established since 1960. Fraxinus americana, Juniperus virginiana, and Juniperus communis were the most common woody species colonizing the barrens. Remnants of large Pinus strobus stumps with extensive charring were found in 90% of the sampled barrens at a mean density of 22.6 stumps ha(-1).Conclusions: Rock barrens on the Frontenac Arch have changed substantially over the past century; gradually being colonized by trees and shrubs and losing their distinctly open character. Active management - including prescribed fire and mechanical thinning - may be necessary if there is a desire to maintain these barrens and the rare species they support as components of the region's biodiversity. However, identification of a reference state for restoration is complicated by the fact that the structure and composition of these habitats were undoubtedly altered by European land clearance in the 19th century, and that some of these areas likely existed as pine woodlands before that."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2023-09-25	WOS:001017908800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

However, community-level conservation tools (such as fencing) may be insufficient for single-species conservation, particularly for non-target endangered or rare species that are sparsely distributed. We examined whether fencing that can protect and recover total plant species richness also benefits non-target endangered or rare species.Location A sub-alpine semi-natural Kirigamine grassland in Nagano Prefecture, Japan.Methods We conducted two complementary plant surveys (typical vegetation survey using 1-m(2) sampling units and flowering survey using 150-m(2) sampling units) to account for scarce species. We examined the community-level responses (species richness, flowering species richness, and flowering abundance) of all species and endangered or rare species and the species-level responses (occurrence and flowering abundance) of each species to deer fences.Results Fencing benefited not only the community-level response of all species, but also that of endangered or rare species. As species-level responses, about half of 43 endangered or rare species had greater flowering abundance inside the fences than outside, but only three of them showed a positive effect on their occurrence. These results suggest that once an endangered or rare species has disappeared, it may be difficult to recover.Conclusions Continued placement of deer fences is necessary to protect community-level plant species richness of sub-alpine endangered and rare species in deer-overbrowsed ecosystems.

Differences in the values of the Weibull cumulative distribution parameters were studied to evaluate their discriminative capacity. Simulation was subsequently used to determine the number of cells needed to define a reliable sampling intensity for each cell size tested. Eight grid cell sizes were tested against six sampling intensities using 1000 iterations for all seven forest types.Results: Each forest presented distinct characteristics regarding the canopy height profile. The higher presence of ground returns was remarkable in less layered structured forests (i.e. rupestrian field and eucalyptus plantations). Depending on the forest type, monotonic and sigmoidal shapes were observed for the cumulative distribution function of the canopy height profile. A sigmoidal cumulative distribution function was typical of a more layered structure (dense and open ombrophilous, and semi-deciduous), whereas less structured typologies (i.e. Rupestrian field and forest plantation) were associated with monotonically shaped functions. Modelling convergence for the canopy height profile was achieved inmost cases with data representing at least 2% cover.Conclusion: Canopy height profiles generated from ALS data proved different among five different forest types: open ombrophilous, dense ombrophilous, semi-deciduous, rupestrian field and eucalyptus plantations. Furthermore, large-scale forest inventories can benefit from the results observed in this study, as it provides recommendations on grid cell size and sampling intensity levels."	9	0	0	0	6	1	10	2016-07-01	WOS:000384751300015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Relative abundance of plants among different functional groups differed between the two forests. Relative numbers of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant seedling individuals were also different between the two forest types with only one shade-intolerant seedling in the plantation compared to 23 seedlings belonging to two species in the natural forest. In the natural forest 11 species of tree seedling were found, while in the plantation only five were found, and the seedling density was only one third of that in the natural forest. Across plots in both forests, understorey plant richness and diversity were negatively correlated with direct sunlight but not indirect sunlight, possibly because direct light plays a more important role in understorey plant growth.ConclusionsWe report lower species and functional diversity and higher light availability in a natural hardwood forest than an adjacent 30-yr C.japonica plantation, possibly due to the increased dominance of shade-intolerant species associated with higher light availability.

Pre-existing CWD and CWD added in 2007 were tested. A linear mixed model was used to test the effect of CWD, CWD decay class and large-end diameter.Results: Total plant moisture content, dry biomass and foliage cover were significantly higher near CWD compared to reference distances. Although CWD did not affect total species richness, native grass richness was significantly lower and cover by exotic forbs significantly higher near CWD than at reference distances. CWD decay state did not significantly affect the measured plant attributes. CWD large-end diameter was positively related to plant moisture content and foliage cover.Conclusions: This is the first study to quantitatively determine the effect of CWD on understorey plants in a cleared temperate woodland. The results indicate that CWD could be important for the survival and growth of understorey plants within ecosystems where trees have been removed. Higher plant moisture content near CWD suggests that CWD may also be effective in protecting plants from extreme moisture loss. This effect appears to be greater for large diameter CWD. Increases in total plant moisture content, dry biomass and foliage cover appear to be rapid and may be related to soil moisture availability as well as protection from solar radiation and soil nutrient enrichment near CWD. However, changes in growing conditions near CWD may also alter competitive interactions in favour of existing exotic species. In ecosystems similar to that examined here, the likelihood of reduced native grass richness along with an increase in exotic forbs near CWD should be taken into account given that CWD may persist for decades. This is particularly true in locations where invasive exotic weeds are present."	18	3	0	0	19	0	23	2014-12-31	WOS:000345761800014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	16	4	NA	NA	667	675	NA	10.1111/avsc.12047	Article	OCT 2013	2013	"Question: Ancient woodland indicator species (AWIs) are plant species which are thought to be restricted to areas of long-continuity woodland habitat. In many cases, however, these species have been identified on the basis of personal, to some extent, subjective experience. Do the species proposed as AWIs according to these lists have traits in common, and how distinct is their trait profile from that of other woodland plant species?Location: United Kingdom.Methods: We applied classification tree analysis to a plant trait database to assess the extent to which proposed AWI species can be clearly separated from other woodland plants based upon their traits. We contrasted AWI species with an objectively defined list of plants that are not considered to be AWIs but that have been commonly recorded in woodlands. We also investigate the effects of phylogeny and region specificity on species' proposed AWI status.Results: The results provide support for the distinctiveness of plant species thought to be associated with ancient woodland; they were found to be almost exclusively short, perennial species, usually with a high seed weight. Results also indicate that rarer AWIs have a more distinguishable trait profile than more common species. No link was found between phylogeny and AWI status.Conclusions: AWI species do have a distinguishable trait profile, despite their often partially subjective selection. The results of the classification tree analysis suggest that traits reflecting poor dispersal ability may be partly responsible for confining these species to ancient woodlands. This confirms other studies that emphasize their low ability to colonize secondary woodland sites and hence vulnerability to habitat conversion."	36	0	0	0	33	0	38	2013-10-01	WOS:000324090800013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Effects of raised water levels on wet grassland plant communities	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	12	3	NA	NA	283	294	NA	10.1111/j.1654-109X.2009.01028.x	Article	AUG 2009	2009	"Questions: What are the effects of raised water levels on wet grassland plant communities and dynamics? To what extent do time since raised water levels, vegetation management and water regime influence community composition?Location: Pevensey Levels, southeast England, UK.Methods: Plant communities and hydrology were monitored during 2001-03 within 23 wet grassland meadows and pastures where water levels had been raised for nature conservation at different times over 21 years. Community variations were examined using species abundance and ecological traits.Results: Water regime, measured as duration of flooding, groundwater level and soil moisture was significantly related to plant community variation. Communities were divided into grasslands where inundation was shallow (<= 8cm) and relatively short (<= 3 months) and sites where deeper flooding was prolonged (>= 5 months), supporting a variety of wetland vegetation. With increasing wetness, sites were characterised by more bare ground and wetland plants such as sedges, helophytes and hydrophytes, and species with a stress-tolerating competitive strategy. All sites showed considerable annual dynamics, especially those with substantially raised water levels. There were no significant relationships between time since water levels were raised and plant community composition. Grassland management exerted a limited influence upon vegetation compared to water regime.Conclusions: Grassland plant communities are responsive to raised water levels and have potential for a rapid transition to wetland vegetation, irrespective of grazing or cutting management. Creation or restoration of wet grasslands by (re)wetting is feasible but challenging due to the high dynamism of wetland plant communities and the need for substantially raised water levels and prolonged flooding to produce significant community changes."	46	3	0	0	44	0	55	2009-08-01	WOS:000268571000003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

The first study is about growth and seedling emergence responses of a short-lived carnivorous plant, Drosera capillaris, to reduction in below-ground competition and above- plus below-ground competition. The second study deals with growth and survival responses of a long-lived perennial carnivorous plant, Sarracenia alata, to neighbour removal and prey-exclusion to determine if a reduction in nutrient supply increased the intensity of competition in this nutrient-poor system.Results: Fire increased seedling emergence of the short-lived species by reducing above-ground competition through the destruction of above-ground parts of plants and the combustion of associated litter. Prey exclusion did not increase competitive effects of neighbours on the long-lived species. However, because the experiment was conducted in a year without fire, shade reduced nutrient demand, which may have obviated competition for soil nutrients between Sarracenia alata and its neighbours.Conclusion: Repeated fires likely interact with interspecific differences in nutrient uptake to simultaneously reduce both above-ground competition and competition for nutrients in old-growth ground cover communities in pine savannas. Restoration practitioners should consider the possibility that the composition of the plant community is just as important as fire in ensuring that frequent fires maintain species diversity."	17	0	0	0	15	0	23	2006-05-01	WOS:000242292500003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

However, no information exists as to whether prevention of encroachment is a cost-effective strategy for Pteridium management. Conventional methods for the control of Pteridium (cutting, asulam application) were tested at one site (Levisham) to quantify their ability to prevent or delay encroachment and to affect the vigour of the Pteridium at the edge of the stand. The effects of encroachment and asulam application on the vegetation present were monitored at a second site (Ramsley), where techniques commonly used for moorland restoration were employed in combination with asulam application.Cutting once per year or a single application of asulam delayed the advance of the Pteridium front. At Levisham, the untreated front advanced 2.7 m in 5 yr, while in the same period the cut front advanced 0.88 m and the sprayed front was 1.5 m behind its initial position. At Ramsley, the untreated front invaded 1.8 m in 5 yr, and the sprayed front was again 1.5 m behind its starting position. Both spraying and cutting reduced frond biomass, frond cover and rhizome biomass. Herbicide spraying prevented the loss of Calluna vulgaris, though the restoration treatments had little effect. The merits of a balanced targeting of control on encroaching fronts or Pteridium at the stand level are discussed for different situations."	18	0	0	0	17	2	20	2002-12-01	WOS:000181162900006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

(b) To what extent can distance from the stream modulate the effect of forest continuity and provide a better understanding of the taxonomic and functional structure of these communities? Location Ouanne watershed, France. Methods We used a paired-samples design, involving stands close to and far from the stream, in ancient or recent riparian forests, in which we studied the vegetation. We performed analyses of species richness and cover, as well as mean values of species preferences and functional traits, and measures of species composition, distinguishing between the understorey and overstorey. Results Strong differences in richness and mean values, as well as in composition, were found between ancient and recent forests. Ancient forests were characterized by species with a dominant stress-tolerant strategy, whereas recent forests were dominated by hygrophilous and nitrophilous species with a dominant competitive strategy. Furthermore, we found that ancient and recent stands close to the stream encompassed a larger richness of species, than ancient and recent riparian stands far from the stream, a pattern mostly driven by the greater co-occurrence of small ruderal species with rapid leaves turnover but also of ancient forest species. Conclusions In small riparian forests along headwater streams, we have shown that past human activities leave still detectable traces in contemporary plant communities. In addition, we pointed out that colonization by ancient indicator species was faster in recent forests closer to the stream. This underscores the need to protect remaining ancient riparian forests that are well connected to the stream, even if they are small, and suggests that bank reforestation as well as restoration of hydrological connectivity on rivers fragmented by artificial barriers may be an effective way to increase forest biodiversity in riparian zones."	5	0	0	0	5	0	5	2021-04-01	WOS:000667075000015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Changes in plant functional composition of wetland vegetation along an aridity gradient on the Highveld plateau of South Africa	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	23	4	NA	NA	622	634	NA	10.1111/avsc.12517	Article	OCT 2020	2020	"Question Plant communities will change along environmental gradients, even in azonal vegetation such as wetlands. It is hypothesized that functional community composition of wetland vegetation changes along a natural gradient from dry low-lying areas to wet high-lying areas. We wanted to know how the functional groups that make up wetland plant communities change along such aridity and altitudinal gradients. Location Highveld area of Central South Africa, covering four provinces of the country: Northern Cape, Free State, North West and Mpumalanga. Methods The community composition of 201 vegetation plots was obtained from a compilation of South African wetland vegetation types of the study area. Functional traits were collected for the dominant plant species and community-weighted means of plant functional traits were calculated for wetland vegetation plots. Redundancy analysis was performed to plot these against environmental and climatic gradients. Results The ordination results showed that the community-weighted plant functional traits were correlated with environmental and climatic variables. For example, specific correlations reveal that root/shoot biomass ratio, leaf nitrogen and specific leaf area are associated with high temperature and evaporation, conditions that prevail in the driest end of the gradient. On the opposite end, wetland vegetation in mesic areas has adaptations for fast growth and high productivity, as it is composed of tall plants with wide stems and deep roots. A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) resulted in nine plant functional groups, with different representation along the aridity gradient in the Highveld Plateau of South Africa. Conclusions Wetlands in dry areas have plant functional groups different from those in mesic areas. Changes in community composition show how wetlands are responding to climatic variability and environmental change. Thus, the study of changes in plant functional groups can be useful for detecting the impacts of climate change on wetland vegetation."	9	0	0	0	5	1	9	2020-09-01	WOS:000561704300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Non-sphagnaceous bryophytes, especially the group of so-called brown mosses, prevail over sphagna under alkaline conditions. In sub-alkaline conditions, rich fens allow the co-occurrence of both these functional groups, but sphagna are competitively superior over non-sphagnaceous bryophytes and seedlings of vascular plants, and they are currently expanding in some regions. We test whether the ratio between the two major bryophyte functional groups (bryo-ratio) accounts for the species composition of vascular plants in fens. Location Central and Eastern Europe. Methods Analysis of two existing regional- and continental-scale data sets of the vegetation- plot records and measured local factors by Canonical Correspondence Analysis with variation partitioning (community-level analysis) and Structural Equation Modelling (species-level analysis). Results At the community level, the bryo-ratio accounted significantly for species composition of fen-specialized vascular plants, more obviously in the regional-scale data set. At the species level, more fen species (50-67% according to the data set) were significantly directly affected (adjusted p < 0.05) by the bryo-ratio than by water pH (14-17%) and by measured water table depth (WTD) in the regional data set (12.5%). In the continental data set, the comparable proportions of species were directly affected by the bryo-ratio and WTD inferred by soil moisture indicator values (50% vs 58%). Most of the species affected significantly by the bryo-ratio preferred the fens rich in non-sphagnaceous bryophytes. They were largely those with a low capability of vegetative reproduction. Conclusions The group of species preferring brown moss patches includes mostly rare and endangered species with a great need for generative reproduction (e.g., Primula farinosa, Triglochin palustris, Pedicularis palustris, Saxifraga hirculus). Our findings demonstrate the important role of the bryophyte layer in the structuring of vascular plant communities in fens and highlight urgent conservation needs for brown moss patches."	23	0	0	0	22	0	25	2019-10-18	WOS:000491327500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

We hypothesized that removal of neighbouring grasses and increased air temperature would enhance B. uncinella growth.Location: High-elevation forest-grassland patches, southern Brazil.Methods: An experiment with factorial design was carried out from Aug 2014 to Sept 2015 using air temperature and neighbour removal as factors with two levels each. Air temperature was increased using acrylic open-top chambers (OTC). For the neighbour removal treatment we removed neighbouring grasses from 30 cm around randomly selected B.uncinella juveniles. Survival, growth and plant physiological status were assessed at the end of the experiment.Results: Plants with OTCs grew more than plants without them. Neighbour removal did not have a significant effect on plant growth. These data suggest that an increase in temperature may enhance encroachment of B. uncinella in the studied grasslands, and that neighbour grasses may act as facilitators for B.uncinella shrubs by improving water balance.Conclusions: Considering the capacity of B.uncinella to expand from forest edges towards grasslands, it is likely that montane grasslands in southern Brazil will be subject to B.uncinella encroachment within the next decades. The potential synergistic - negative - effects of global warming and habitat loss might jeopardize the high biodiversity of this ecosystem.

Does the tree and shrub species richness structure and complexity affect the richness of forest and grassland specialist species?LocationSoutheast Sweden.MethodsWe sampled 50 forest edges with different levels of structural complexity in agricultural landscapes. In each border we recorded trees, shrubs and herb layer species in a 50-m transect parallel with the forest. We investigated species composition and species turnover in relation to the proportions of gaps in the border and the diversity of trees and shrubs.ResultsTotal plant species richness in the field layer was mainly explained by the proportion of gaps to areas with full canopy cover and tree diversity. Increasing number of gaps promoted higher diversity of grassland specialist species within the field layer, resulting in open forest borders with the highest overall species richness. Gaps did however have a negative impact on forest species richness. Conversely, increasing forest species richness was positively related to tree diversity, but the number of grassland specialist species was negatively affected by tree diversity.ConclusionsManaging forest borders, and therefore increasing the area of semi-open habitats in fragmented agricultural landscapes, provides future opportunities to create a network of suitable habitats for both grassland and deciduous forest specialist species. Such measures therefore have the potential to increase functional connectivity and support dispersal of species in homogeneous forest/agricultural landscapes."	13	0	0	0	10	0	14	2018-03-13	WOS:000425120600010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Is there a relationship between fern assemblages and microclimate, both along gradients of elevation and disturbance? Which species are most sensitive to habitat disturbance and microclimatic changes?LocationFrom sea level close to the Gulf of Mexico 81km away in a direct line on the eastern slopes of the Cofre de Perote at 3500m, central Veracruz, Mexico.MethodsWe studied the richness and composition of fern assemblages in 120 study plots at eight elevations from 20-3500m in three forest types: natural forest (NF), disturbed forest (DF) subjected to timber extraction and grazing, and secondary forest (SF) regrown after total clearance 15-20yr ago. In addition, we measured microclimatic conditions in the three forest types at five elevations over a year.ResultsFern richness peaked in humid montane forests at mid-elevations and was low in the drier habitats at the ends of the gradient. Humid montane forests were most sensitive to disturbance, showing increases in mean annual temperatures by about 1 degrees C and reduction in relative air humidity by about 20% in DF and SF compared to NF. This was together with a reduction in fern species richness of 5-60% and marked changes in species composition. In contrast, drought-deciduous forests at low elevations and coniferous forests at high elevations already had low humidity and high light intensity in NF and were less affected by human impact: their microclimatic conditions and fern assemblages did not change markedly in DF and SF.ConclusionsThe conservation of much of the humidity-dependent biota (ferns and presumably also groups such as bryophytes and amphibians) in humid montane forests depends on the protection of natural fragments without human disturbance. In contrast, the naturally open forests at the ends of the gradient can be subjected to some exploitation while conserving much of their fern flora as long as a general forest structure is maintained."	28	2	0	0	29	9	35	2017-10-01	WOS:000412077700013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Are there differences in herbaceous layer nutrient storage for urban park and state preserve forests, and is there seasonal variation?LocationUnited States, Midwestern region (Iowa).MethodsWe examined the herbaceous layer in three 20-m(2) plots at six forest sites, in urban parks (city parks with high human visitation) and state preserves (under permanent protection as state preserves). We harvested herbaceous plants from quadrats in each plot in spring, summer and autumn to analyse above- and below-ground tissues for total C, N and P concentrations. Biomass and tissue nutrient concentration data were used to estimate nutrient storage per plot and per hectare. We also collected soil samples at each plot in each season to determine soil C, N and P content.ResultsState preserve and urban park forests did not differ in herbaceous species richness, although state preserve forests were qualitatively distinct. State preserve forests had relatively higher biomass and nutrients than urban park forests. In both forest types, above-ground concentration for N and P were higher in spring than in autumn, whereas below-ground concentration of these nutrients was consistently higher in autumn. In urban parks, total soil N was higher in spring compared to summer and autumn. However, soil nutrient content did not appear to drive differences in plant tissue nutrient content in urban park forests.ConclusionsSubtle qualitative differences in herbaceous layer composition affected seasonal biomass quantities and nutrient concentrations in urban park and state preserve forests. These differences influenced C, N and P storage and led to consistent trends for relatively higher biomass and nutrient storage in state preserve forests. Above-ground plant tissue provides important storage of N and P in spring, and below-ground plant tissue provides important storage of N and P in autumn. Since spring and autumn are seasons of limited vegetative cover in the regional landscape, with subsequently higher potential for nutrient loss from terrestrial systems, this finding is crucial for provision of ecosystem services."	16	1	0	0	9	0	18	2016-11-23	WOS:000386136600015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

In all site types, a set of small patches had more edaphically demanding and red-listed species than did a few large patches of the equal total area.Conclusions: For conservation, it is essential to protect representative sets of different herb-rich forest site types because flora varies between the site types.

S. Our objective was to assess forest composition, structure, and succession following the interaction of two frequently occurring disturbance events in southern Pinus spp. forests: cut-and-leave suppression, a commonly used means for managing D. frontalis outbreaks, and wildfire.Location: Western Gulf Coastal Plain, Louisiana, USA.Method: Pinus taeda stands with cut-and-leave suppression and subsequent wildfire were compared to stands undisturbed by D. frontalis but with the same wildfire events twenty years after Pinus spp. mortality. The woody plant community was assessed in three different size classes and used to predict future forest types with the Forest Vegetation Simulator (50 years).Results: P. taeda is the most abundant (> 50%) species of saw-and poletimber-sizes following cut-and-leave suppression with wildfire and in stands only with fire. Using canonical correspondence analysis, vegetation assemblages were primarily explained by slope position and elevation (7.6% variation explained). Fire intensity and stand age also accounted for variance in the ordination (4.4% and 3.1%, respectively). Dominant and co-dominant P. taeda forest types were predicted by the model to be the most abundant forest types in each disturbance regime. In addition, new regeneration represents high hazard for future mortality from D. frontalis.Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that cut-and-leave suppression with additional wildfire disturbance maintains P. taeda composition, and does not alter forest composition differently from stands receiving only wildfire. As a result, predicted Pinus spp. basal area under both disturbances is great enough to facilitate future bark beetle disturbance."	9	0	0	0	7	0	11	2008-04-01	WOS:000255229600010	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, solar illumination, vegetation phenology and prevailing weather conditions will impact the quality of the derived products to differing degrees. In this study, we investigate how seasonal differences in solar illumination, tree foliage and weather conditions impact the accuracy of digital elevation models (DEM) and canopy height models (CHM) in a heterogeneous boreal landscape. Methods: We compared DEMs and CHMs derived from drone photogrammetry with DEMs and CHMs produced from a drone-mounted laser scanner across three seasons with different solar illumination, tree foliage and weather conditions during leaf-off and leaf-on seasons. Photogrammetric height models were evaluated across three land-cover classes consisting of open areas, sparse-forest and forest. The most accurate CHM for sparse-forest was produced during summer under overcast conditions, whereas for the forest class, summer under clear skies was best. Results: Structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry performed well against the LiDAR survey in most cases with correlations between sampled points of up to R-2 = 0.995. Root mean square errors (RMSEs) were <1.5 m in all DEMs and as low as 0.31 m in autumn clear-sky data over open terrain. CHM RMSEs were somewhat higher in all cases except under winter overcast conditions when the RMSE for sparse-forest reached 6.03 m. Conclusions: We have shown that SfM photogrammetry is surprisingly robust to variations in vegetation type, tree phenology and weather, and performs well in comparison with a reference LiDAR data set. Our results show that, in boreal forests, autumn is the preferred season under clear-sky conditions for DEM generation from SfM photogrammetry across all land-cover classes, whereas summer is preferred for CHM modelling with a small trade-off between overcast and clear-sky conditions over different vegetation types. These results can help potential SfM users in ecology and forestry plan missions and review the quality of products derived from drone photogrammetry products."	2	0	0	0	1	0	2	2024-07-28	WOS:001274457800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Eastern slopes of the Cofre de Perote mountain, state of Veracruz, Mexico. Methods We assessed tree diversity and composition using a sampling design in which elevation was crossed with three levels of forest use intensity: old-growth, degraded, and secondary forests.

Along the entire elevational gradient, there were 217 tree species distributed within 154 genera and 80 families. Species accumulation curves revealed that forests at 0 m and 1,500 m elevation showed differences in species richness among forest use intensities. In contrast, species richness did not differ between old-growth forest and the other forest use intensities in five of the eight studied elevations. In terms of community composition, secondary forests differed from old-growth and degraded forests. Conclusion Our results suggest that the interactive effects of elevation and forest use intensity change tree diversity patterns and community composition along a tropical elevational gradient. Degraded forests were similar to old-growth forests in terms of species diversity and composition, suggesting that they may act as a safeguard of tree diversity in human-dominated tropical landscapes."	21	1	0	0	15	1	24	2019-12-09	WOS:000501507600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Effects of woody species encroachment and fire on vegetation and the soil seed bank in dry grasslands of Transylvania	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	22	3	NA	NA	409	422	NA	10.1111/avsc.12435	Article	JUN 2019	2019	"Questions (a) In which ways do woody species encroachment and fire affect vegetation and seed bank composition, structure and diversity in Transylvanian dry grassland; (b) do native and non-native woody species differ with respect to their impact on grassland community composition and structure; (c) is burning useful to control woody species encroachment; and (d) can soil seed banks contribute to the restoration of grasslands in Transylvania? Location Transylvania, Romania. Methods We collected data on vegetation and seed bank composition in 4 m(2) plots in 16 shrub-encroached grasslands and adjacent open grassland. Data were analyzed with regard to the impact of woody species encroachment (native vs non-native) and fire on grassland vegetation and the seed bank using NMDS and LME models combined with ANOVA and Tukey contrast tests. Results Encroachment was accompanied by a decrease in plant species diversity and altered microclimatic conditions. There was a lack of sufficient evidence for a difference in effect size between native and non-native woody species on tested vegetation or seed bank parameters. While the effects of fire on vegetation were weak compared to encroachment, burning failed to reduce the cover of woody species sustainably. Grassland vegetation and the seed bank differed significantly in species composition and diversity, indicating a limited potential for restoration from the seed bank alone. Conclusions To halt secondary succession in Transylvanian grassland sustainably, we suggest the establishment of a post-fire management regime including the cutting of woody species and/or re-introduction of grazing and mowing. Grassland restoration from the seed bank may be supported by the introduction of species from surrounding intact grassland."	13	0	0	0	10	0	14	2019-06-01	WOS:000473236900005	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Ordinal cover data often need to be transformed to a quantitative form (0%-100%), especially when scrutinising summed cover of multiple species. Traditional approaches to transforming ordinal data often assume that data are symmetrically distributed. However, skewed abundance patterns are ubiquitous in plant community ecology. The questions this paper addresses are (a) how can we estimate transformation values for ordinal data that account for the underlying right-skewed distribution of plant cover; (b) do different plant groups require different transformations; and (c) how do our transformations compare to other commonly used transformations within the context of exploring the aggregate properties of vegetation? Location Global. Methods We assigned Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance ordinal values to continuous cover observations. We fitted a Bayesian hierarchical beta regression to estimate the predicted mean (PM) cover of each of six plant growth forms within six ordinal classes. We illustrate our method using a case study (2,809 plots containing 95,812 observations), compare the model-derived estimates to other commonly used transformations and validate our model using an independent dataset (2,227 plots containing 51,497 observations) accessed through the VegBank database. Results Our model found that PM estimates differed by growth form and that previous methods overestimated cover, especially of smaller growth forms such as forbs and grasses. Our approach reduced the cumulative compounding of errors and was robust when validated against an independent dataset. Conclusions By accounting for the right-skewed distribution of cover data, our alternate approach for estimating transformation values can be extended to other ordinal scales. A more robust approach to transforming floristic data and aggregating cover estimates can strengthen ecological analyses to support biodiversity conservation and management."	22	0	0	0	19	0	25	2019-07-12	WOS:000473236900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The relative interaction index (RII) was used to calculate the effect of the shrub on the herbs. Additionally, we conducted a removal experiment at the latest successional stage to assess the beneficiary feedback effects on the growth of the shrub's vegetative and reproductive twigs.Results: The response of herbs to the effect of the benefactor shrub showed a humped-back curve for abundance and biomass along the successional gradient, supporting the collapse of the interaction model, but a linear curve for richness, thus supporting the stress-gradient hypothesis. This difference could likely be explained by a turnover of life-history groups of understorey species from annuals to perennials along the successional gradient, with the growth of the latter group being more susceptible to shrub facilitation than the former. The herbs had a negative feedback effect on the growth of the shrub's reproductive twigs.Conclusions: Our results suggest that the relationship between the shrub A. ordosica and the associated herbs was antagonistic, and the absence of shrub seedling recruitment at the end of succession suggests that this antagonistic relationship was a crucial driver of a successional shift from a shrub-dominated to a herb-dominated community."	26	7	0	0	28	0	34	2018-10-01	WOS:000450061000004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How does the ditch margin vegetation develop as a function of regular dredging? Is ornithologically oriented management also beneficial for plant biodiversity?LocationRiparian marshes, Eider-Treene-Sorge lowland, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.MethodsWe performed vegetation surveys of drainage ditches along with their water body, slope and margin structures annually for 3years. The data were analysed with respect to date and means of ditch dredging. In addition, we recorded vegetation of the surrounding agricultural grassland, measured nutrient status of the soil and the water body and sampled seed bank of the ditch slopes. We used ANOVA and multivariate methods to describe the development of the ditch vegetation and the persistence of target meadow species.ResultsVegetation re-development of ditch margins proceeds quite rapidly after disturbance from dredging. Dominance of mudbank species was observed only in the first year, followed by an increase of reed species and reduction of phytodiversity. Target species of wet meadow communities reach highest abundance in the second and third year and build a significant seed bank before being suppressed by reeds.ConclusionsIn heavily eutrophicated, intensively used marsh grassland, regularly disturbed ditch margins are important secondary habitats for pioneer and subdominant wetland species, which have nearly disappeared in a larger area. Current management cycles of ditch dredging every 3-4years comply with the successional development, allowing the mudbank and wet meadow species to persist in the vegetation and seed bank. In contrast to the frequency, the form of dredging (ditch profile), which is crucial for bird protection, plays a minor role for plants. We recommend moderate disturbance (mowing of ditch margins) to suppress strong competitors in the years between dredging for additional support to target plant species."	9	0	0	0	9	0	10	2018-12-28	WOS:000425120600004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Which functional traits respond to stress imposed by each land-use type in the two forest layers?LocationFull-protection conservation areas in the metropolitan region of Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil.MethodsWe calculated the proportions of species and individuals of woody plants in terms of their functional traits (seed size, maximum height, dispersal syndrome and regeneration strategy) along the edge and in the interior of tropical Atlantic Forest remnants exposed to different degrees of adjacent urbanization along their borders (urban, suburban and rural) by establishing 120 sampling points (60 plots considering the arboreal components and 60 subplots considering woody understorey plants).The degree of urbanization adjacent to the edges of the remnant forests were determined by mapping the sites based on satellite images. The intensities of the edge effects on functional composition, and the differences in the functional traits were assessed using multivariate analysis.ResultsFunctional composition along the edges and within the forest interiors of remnants with the highest densities of urban areas around them demonstrated the greatest variability of both the arboreal and understorey components. The arboreal component of the forest sites adjacent to rural areas (intense agricultural activities) tended to demonstrate intermediate intensity edge effects. Species showing shade intolerance, with smaller maximum heights, producing small seeds and with abiotic dispersion were present in high proportions in forests bordering heavily urbanized areas. Biotic dispersal predominated in the arboreal component of the rural remnant.ConclusionsFrom a functional point of view, the forest with the most highly urbanized border is more impacted by edge effects than forests bordering on suburban or rural areas. Nonetheless, in an urban-rural gradient, intense agricultural activity was observed to create intermediate pressure in terms of the intensities of its edge effects. These edge effects differentially impact the functional traits of the arboreal and understorey components, influencing different traits, depending on the type of border."	18	2	0	0	16	0	21	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Are alien woody species more successful than natives in their resprouting after the two treatments proposed to control shrub encroachment? Is resprouting influenced by age of the individuals? Does resprouting differ between cutting and burning?LocationTemperate grasslands encroached by shrubs, Transylvania, Romania.MethodsWe investigated the resprouting after cutting or burning of four shrub species (Cornus sanguinea, Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa and Rosa canina) encroaching grasslands in field sites 3yr following treatments. We compared the resprouting ability of shrubs between species and treatments and analysed the relationship between the number of resprouts and stump diameter, as a proxy for age. In a common garden experiment on 1-yr-old individuals we compared resprouting after cutting and burning between three native (C.sanguinea, C.monogyna and P.spinosa) and three alien woody species (Ailanthus altissima, Elaeagnus angustifolia and Hippophae rhamnoides) during one growing season.ResultsC.monogyna produced the largest number of resprouts in the field study, and H.rhamnoides in the experimental study. Overall, resprouting ability of alien woody species did not differ from that of natives. In the field study, we found an increasing number of resprouts with increasing stump diameter, and the rate of increase in the number of resprouts was highest in C.monogyna. We detected no difference in the resprouting of woody species between cutting and burning treatments either in the field or in the experimental study.ConclusionsOur study suggests that the success of encroachment control in grasslands does not depend on treatment type, but on the woody species composition and age of individuals. Grasslands encroached by C.monogyna or H.rhamnoides will be more labour-intensive to restore and maintain free of shrubs. Restoration measures should be implemented in the early stage of shrub encroachment since younger shrubs have lower resprouting ability. Burning and cutting may be equally effective in controlling shrub encroachment, but treatments should be more intensive than in the current study in order to damage the resprouting buds and arrest resprouting."	20	1	0	0	19	0	21	2017-07-04	WOS:000403676000008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Additionally, topsoil temperature was monitored for 1mo in the four situations under study.ResultsAverage and maximum temperature and temperature amplitudes were lower under the canopy of B.prunifolia shrubs than in open areas; this effect being more marked far from the forest edge. Species richness, vegetation cover and the density of dominant forest trees were higher under the shrubs' canopy than in the inter-shrub spaces. The proximity to the edge of the surrounding forest also had a positive effect on species richness, with no significant interaction with the local sampling situation (under shrub vs outside).ConclusionsOur results suggest that both facilitation and edge effects influence the effectiveness of vegetation regeneration within old-fields in the high tropical Andes.

Rarefaction curves were plotted to assess differences in species richness among treatments. Variation partitioning was used to assess main drivers of species composition and abundance. Partial Mantel correlations were calculated to verify edge effects controlling for effect of space on the abundance of Euterpe edulis palm and two ecological groups. For this purpose, species were classified either as disturbance-tolerant or disturbance-sensitive.ResultsEdge effects of linear canopy openings affect understorey species composition, but not species richness. Disturbance-tolerant species were more abundant in edges than in forest interiors, while disturbance-sensitive species did not show differences among treatments. However, the late-successional palm Euterpe edulis, which is abundant in forest interiors, was significantly less common at edges.

Given this assumption, we used pre-strip- mine data (800 points from a 88 km 2 site) to demonstrate statistical methods for identifying native communities, describing them, and determining their environments.Results and conclusions: Classification and pruning analysis provided an objective method for choosing the number of target community types to be used in reclamation. The composition of eight target types, identified with these analyses, was described with a releve table to provide a species list, target cover levels and support the choice of species to be seeded.As a basis for siting communities, we modeled community presence as a function of topography, slope/aspect, and substrate. Logistic GLMs identified the optimal environment for each community. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis identified the most probable community in each environmental facet.

Does within-stand understory vegetation variability increase after imposing treatments that increase stand structural complexity of the overstory? What is the relative contribution of individual stand structural components (i.e. forest matrix, gaps, and leave island reserves) to changes in understory vegetation richness?LocationSeven study sites in the Coastal Range and Cascades regions of Oregon, USA.MethodsWe examined the effects of thinning six years after harvest on understory plant vascular richness and cover in 40- to 60-year-old forest stands dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). At each site, one unthinned control was preserved and three thinning treatments were implemented: low complexity (LC, 300 trees ha(-1)), moderate complexity (MC, 200 trees ha(-1)), and high complexity (HC, variable densities from 100 to 300 trees ha(-1)). Gaps openings and leave island reserves were established in MC and HC.ResultsRichness of all herbs, forest herbs, early seral herbs and shrubs, and introduced species increased in all thinning treatments, although early seral herbs and introduced species remained a small component. Only cover of early seral herbs and shrubs increased in all thinning treatments whereas forest shrub cover increased in MC and HC. In the understory, we found 284 vascular plant species. After accounting for site-level differences, the richness of understory communities in thinned stands differed from those in control stands. Within-treatment variability of herb and shrub richness was reduced by thinning. Matrix areas and gap openings in thinned treatments appeared to contribute to the recruitment of early seral herbs and shrubs.ConclusionsUnderstory vegetation richness increased 6 years after imposing treatments, with increasing stand complexity mainly because of the recruitment of early seral and forest herbs, and both low and tall shrubs. Changes in stand density did not likely lead to competitive species exclusion. The abundance of potentially invasive introduced species was much lower compared to other plant groups. Post-thinning reductions in within-treatment variability was caused by greater abundance of early seral herbs and shrubs in thinned stands compared with the control. Gaps and low-density forest matrix areas created as part of spatially variably thinning had greater overall species richness. Increased overstory variability encouraged development of multiple layers of understory vegetation."	62	2	0	0	54	3	72	2009-10-01	WOS:000269455100008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Location: Old-growth forests of the southeastern United States. Methods: Reviews of the plant allozyme literature are used to identify differences in genetic diversity and structure among species with different life forms, distributions and breeding systems. The general results are illustrated by case studies of four plant species characteristic of two widespread old-growth forest communities of the southeastern United States: the Pinus palustris - Aristida stricta (Longleaf pine - wiregrass) savanna of the Coastal Plain and the Quercus - Carya - Pinus (Oak-hickory-pine) forest of the Piedmont. Genetic variation patterns of single-gene and quantitative traits are also reviewed. Results: Dominant forest trees, represented by Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) and Quercus rubra (Northern red oak), maintain most of their genetic diversity within their populations whereas a higher proportion of the genetic diversity of herbaceous understorey species such as Sarracenia leucophylla and Trillium reliquum is distributed among their populations. The herbaceous species also tend to have more population-to-population variation in genetic diversity. Higher genetic differentiation among populations is seen for quantitative traits than for allozyme traits, indicating that interpopulation variation in quantitative traits is influenced by natural selection. Conclusion: Developing effective conservation strategies for one or a few species may not prove adequate for species with other combinations of traits. Given suitable empirical studies, it should be possible to design efficient conservation programs that maintain natural levels of genetic diversity within species of conservation interest."	14	0	0	0	12	0	15	2006-05-01	WOS:000242292500007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Temporal variations in the spatial distribution of fine-root mass and nutrient concentrations were studied in recently harvested and mature bamboo savanna sites in the dry tropical Vindhyan region in India. The soil block method and root-free-soil cages were used to investigate fine-root dynamics. The mean annual fine-root biomass was 596 and 690 g/m2 in harvested and mature sites, respectively. The fine-root net production calculated by different methods ranged from 486 to 749 g m-2 yr-1 in the harvested site and 485 to 875 g m-2 yr1 in the mature site. All fine-root mass fractions decreased with increase in distance from the base of bamboo clumps, and the herb root mass showed the reverse trend. Bamboo fine roots were better developed in the 10 - 20 cm soil depth and those of herbs in the upper 10 cm. The ingrowth of fine roots in root-free-soil cages showed maximum biomass accumulation during the rainy season (64.2 - 69.9 g m-2 mo-1) and minimum in the summer (4.5 - 7.5 g m-2 mo-1). The fine-root nutrient concentrations were strongly related to their diameter. The fine-root nutrient concentrations varied considerably in different seasons. The highest nutrient concentrations in all categories were recorded in summer followed by winter and rainy seasons. Nutrient concentrations in live roots were always greater than those found in dead roots in different diameter classes. We suggest the occurrence of nutrient retranslocation from senescent roots to surviving roots in bamboo savanna. Fine roots in the bamboo savanna increased as a function of N-mineralization and nitrification rates. This tendency further increased after the harvest of bamboo, suggesting the crucial role of fine roots in the bamboo savanna after the harvesting of bamboo culms."	22	4	0	0	18	0	28	1999-12-01	WOS:000208472100008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Conservation management has significant gaps between (1) collection and storage of biological data, (2) data analysis, and (3) application of results. In order to improve management decision-making, it is necessary to bridge these gaps. One of the most promising approaches uses computer-based decision support systems (DSS): interactive models of the system in questionfor example, a nature reserve. One kind of DSS is scenario modeling: spatially-based models which (1) use expert opinion and data on vegetation, geology, hydrology, and management, (2) to project changes in landscape through time, (3) on the basis of changes in driving environmental factors. Scenario models are essentially graphic hypotheses, predicting changes in landscape with a specified change in driving factors, which can then be verified or falsified by monitoring. This paper presents an application of this approach to an Israeli nature reserve, the En Afeq Reserve in western Galilee. Our project tests the possibility of improving Israeli conservation management by using methods now standard for nature reserves in the Netherlands."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1999-05-01	WOS:000208472000015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

The main question to be dealt with in the papers published in this Special Feature is to which extent plant species richness can be applied as a parameter in restoration projects to qualify the ecosystem's state. Before considering this problem, it should be recognized that this approach illuminates only one side of the coin; the other side is touched by the opposite question, asking which plant species are essential components of an ecosystem. These two approaches towards the relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning are not mutually exclusive, but should not be confused either. In view of ecosystem functioning certain species may be considered redundant, while in view of evolutionary processes certain ecosystem processes may be considered redundant. Where do the two approaches meet and when should they be separated? This paper touches upon this question by referring to the dual hierarchy of ecological systems."	10	0	0	0	8	0	10	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

To what extent does abundance of recalcitrant understorey species influence conifer tree regeneration? How does salvage logging influence microclimate conditions? Location: Scientific Forest Management Area, Baxter State Park, Maine, USA. Methods: In 2013, a rare tornado and subsequent salvage operation created three clear treatments for evaluation of post-disturbance understorey community response: blowdown, blowdown followed by salvage logging and an undisturbed forested control. Ten years post tornado, we inventoried understorey vegetation at 10 sampling points within each of these treatments. We installed automated sensors to track temperature and soil moisture throughout a growing season and used hemispherical photographs to characterize canopy openness. Results: Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination based on species importance values indicated distinct species groupings according to treatment, with the salvage treatment supporting a higher abundance of the recalcitrant species, Rubus idaeus and Pteridium aquilinum. Abundance of conifer regeneration was notably lower in areas with high abundance of Rubus idaeus or Pteridium aquilinum. Daily soil surface temperature fluctuations and canopy openness (both factors that influence seed germination) decreased in the order salvage > blowdown > control. Ordination results suggest that these two factors were the primary drivers of the observed compositional differences. Conclusions: This study furthers our understanding of the interactions among disturbance, microclimate, and understorey communities, highlighting the need for increased consideration of long-term effects on vegetation development following salvage logging. Our findings support recommendations to intermingle salvage patches within blowdown areas to promote landscape heterogeneity and species diversity."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2024-12-18	WOS:001374749000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Ideally, herbaceous seed mixtures should reduce the establishment and growth of many invading tree species over several years. Theory predicts that invasion resistance can be maximized by both: (a) increasing the diversity (taxonomic and/or functional) of resident seed mixtures, and (b) including species that are especially efficient at blocking further colonizers. We established an experiment in a regularly mown old field within a deciduous forest region in southeastern Canada. Our overall goal was to examine the relative contribution of old field community composition and diversity (taxonomic and functional) to resistance against encroachment by two undesirable native tree species over time.LocationVarennes, southern Qu & eacute;bec, Canada (45 degrees 37 ' 01.24 '' N, 73 degrees 23 ' 03.57 '' W).MethodsWe tested our hypotheses by seeding experimental plots with different levels of taxonomic diversity (from one to nine species) and functional group richness (grasses, legumes, and forbs). Our herbaceous species comprised four native species and five introduced and naturalized species. We then seeded the plots with two model tree colonizers, Acer rubrum and Betula populifolia, during three consecutive years. We also transplanted seedlings of Acer and Betula to determine the effect of herbaceous diversity on post-emergence growth and seedling survival.ResultsOverall, herbaceous species identity (presence and absence) better predicted the resistance of resident herbaceous seed mixtures to tree encroachment than the other diversity measures assessed in our study. Fast-growing herbaceous species, such as Lolium, substantially inhibit resistance to woody encroachment in the first year. Achillea millefolium and Solidago canadensis were by far the most efficient in blocking tree seedling establishment and growth, particularly during the second and third years. These effects highlight the potential for a combination of fast-growing species, along with slower-growing but highly inhibitive species, as a way to limit tree encroachment in real field applications. Functional group richness was a poor predictor of tree encroachment. Species richness reduced tree encroachment, especially when considering a multidimensional tree encroachment index integrating all aspects of tree establishment and growth over the three years of our experiment.ConclusionsSeeding highly inhibiting herbaceous species is the most efficient approach against specific tree invaders. However, it is difficult to implement in practice because it relies on a priori knowledge of the species' inhibitory effects. In the absence of this knowledge, the taxonomic richness of seed mixtures should be increased to prevent tree encroachment.Herbaceous plant covers can inhibit tree encroachment in many managed and semi-natural grasslands, yet identifying the primary influence of seed mixture composition or diversity poses challenges. This study reveals that herbaceous species identity more accurately predicts seed mixture resistance to tree encroachment. Achillea millefolium and Solidago canadensis were by far the most efficient in blocking Acer rubrum and Betula populifolia tree seedlings.

(2) Do seed densities and species composition of seed banks and seed rain differ between the pond and mature salt marsh, and between elevations? (3) Do seed densities vary over time? (4) Within the pond, can seed densities be explained by the abundance of reproductive plants, elevation, or distance from the pond inlet. Location Dry Creek salt field, South Australia. Methods We sampled seed rain (monthly) and seed banks (every three months) 6 to 18 months after tidal reconnection and surveyed ground cover (plant species, logs, seagrass wrack and bare ground) up to 34 months after reconnection. Samples were collected from the pond and from mature marsh vegetation at a reference site, and a site immediately adjacent to the pond inlet. Results Vegetation cover in the pond increased more quickly at mid elevations compared with low elevations. Regarding the composition of ground cover, seed rain and seed banks, the site became more similar to the adjacent site than to the reference site. Seed densities increased from late autumn to early winter. The pattern of seed densities across sites and elevations differed between seed rain and seed banks. Seeds of Salicornia quinqueflora and Suaeda australis dominated in the pond, reflecting their high seed densities adjacent to the pond inlet. Variation in seed densities of both species in the pond was explained by the abundance of nearby, reproductive conspecifics but not by the distance from the inlet. Conclusions Early stages of salt marsh revegetation were driven by tidal import of seeds and by the rapid seed production of early colonising species; however, low seed densities may reduce rates of revegetation at low elevations. Seed dispersal and revegetation may be maximised by undertaking tidal reconnection when seed densities are highest."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2022-05-22	WOS:000793796300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

We undertook soil sampling and collected information about the plants (taxonomy, height, circumference and establishment form by germination or resprouting). We defined habitat distance as the predictor variable for the following response variables: abundance, richness, establishment form, mean height, mean diameter at soil height and dispersal syndrome of the individuals sampled; in addition to the porosity and bulk density of the sampled soil.Results: We found significant differences between habitat and matrix for abundance, richness, mean height and germination number, but non-significant differences for resprouting number and mean diameter at soil height. There was no relationship regarding matrix-habitat distances for structural variables, and habitat species composition was similar only for the first 10 m distance from the habitat edge.Conclusion: Pasture did not prevent plant establishment but might act as an environmental filter. Pasture matrices modify the composition and diversity of the plant community compared with the Cerrado community. Pastures are dominated by resprouting, autochory and grassland species. Regenerating plants from the propagule bank of the matrix showed the potential for natural regeneration of Cerrado areas in pasture as a restoration strategy."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2022-06-10	WOS:000801224400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

The aims of this study were to evaluate: (a) how adjacent land use affects the ecological condition of riparian habitats; and (b) whether the ecological condition relates to riparian vegetation properties (i.e., structure, diversity, and species composition). Location Watershed of the Duero River, in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. Methods Sampling sites were established along the Duero River riverbank by considering three different land uses (i.e., native forest, agriculture, and urban). At each site, we assessed the ecological condition of riparian habitats with a riparian condition index (RCI) composed of six subindices, with 17 indicators. Using a survey of woody plants (DBH >= 2.5 cm) in 12 different 0.1-ha sites, we assessed vegetation properties. Results According to the RCI, 76% of the studied riparian habitats had a very poor ecological condition, and only one site scored an excellent condition. The values of all subindices as well as the RCI were significantly greater in the forest than in the agricultural or urban land uses. The significant relationships between the RCI and its components (subindices) with vegetation properties were all positive and explained between 22% and 73% of the variation in structural and diversity attributes, and between 48% and 66% in floristic composition. Conclusions This study shows how human land-use activities affect the ecological condition of riparian habitats and hence riparian forests. Overall, the RCI had a high predictive power for the vegetation properties of riparian forests. This information is critical for programs involved in the management, conservation, and ecological restoration of riparian habitats. Low-cost and time-efficient indices, such as the RCI, facilitate ecological condition assessments of riparian habitats not only by scientists but also by previously trained land managers and the general public."	9	1	0	0	7	2	13	2020-07-29	WOS:000549761000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

What are the consequences of post-windthrow salvage logging on these key attributes?LocationEastern black spruce-moss forest, Quebec, Canada.MethodsA total of 92 plots were sampled, each with a radius of 11.28m; 49 of these plots were salvaged while 43 were unsalvaged. Regeneration density, plant diversity and seedbeds were characterized. We tested the effect of microtopography and windthrow severity on species richness and Shannon diversity index for salvaged and unsalvaged windthrows using a mixed model. Partial redundancy analysis (RDA) determined which environmental and stand characteristics were most important in explaining differences in plant species and forest floor types among the treatments. The effects of treatments (salvaged and unsalvaged windthrows), microtopography attributes, windthrow severity and regeneration species on seedling and sapling abundance were tested using a linear mixed model.ResultsSalvaged windthrow, with a large proportion of skid trails, dead mosses and Sphagnum, had a lower degree of seedbed heterogeneity. Also, some understorey species present in the unsalvaged ecosystem were absent from the salvaged windthrow. Sphagnum and other moss species were clearly associated with the unsalvaged treatment. White birches were positively associated with mound microtopography in the unsalvaged windthrow.ConclusionFrom an ecosystem-based forest management perspective, natural post-windthrow understorey conditions and microsite heterogeneity can be in part maintained in salvaged cut blocks by incorporating retention patches that include downed and standing dead wood and living trees of diverse sizes. These steps should favour plant regeneration and augment diversity for salvage logging after wind disturbance."	38	0	0	0	29	0	43	2014-04-01	WOS:000332774800013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

What is the contribution of small fragments to the conservation of native species pool of the region?Location: Tandilia's Range, Southern Pampa, Argentina.Methods: Cover of plants was registered within 24 fragments of tall-tussock grassland remnants within an agricultural landscape using modified Whittaker nested sampling. We analysed the influence of site variables related to disturbance history (canopy height, litter thickness) and fragment variables (size, connectivity) on species richness (asymptotic species richness, slope of the species-area curve) as well as on species assemblages by multiple regressions analysis and canonical correspondence analyses, respectively. Cumulative area was used for analysing whether small fragments or large fragments are more important to species diversity in the landscape.Results: Asymptotic species richness was significantly influenced by site variables, in particular by Paspalum quadrifarium's canopy height, but not by fragment variables. Species assemblages were also affected by site variables (12.2% of total variation), but no additional portion of the species assemblage variability was significantly explained by fragment size and connectivity. Sampling of several small fragments rendered more exotic and native species than sampling of few large fragments of the same total area.Conclusions: Our results agree with previous studies reporting low sensitivity of species diversity to size and isolation of grassland fragments in fragmented landscapes and high sensitivity of species diversity to local variables. The higher capture of regional native species pool by small grassland fragments than by few larger ones of equivalent accumulated area highlights the value of small fragments for conservation."	28	0	0	0	22	3	32	2011-03-23	WOS:000287863600004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Flowering shoots were counted and phenological phases were estimated four times during a growing season.Results: The numbers of flowering or seed-producing species and shoots indicated that mowing once a year corresponding to the timing of traditional management was markedly better than mowing twice a year. The difference between the management groups was greatest at the end of July when the number of flowering species was 43% and the number of flowering and seed-producing shoots 76% less after the first mowing than in the still unmown sites. The species avoided early cutting either through the timing of flowering or due to their growth form. Early season mowing had no effect on the occurrence and seed-producing success of grassland species and the first flowering species.

Primary conservation management goals for the Pinus palustris ecosystem include the perpetual regeneration of the fire-maintained forest and conservation of the characteristically high biological diversity and rare species. Several attributes, such as a sustained population of Picoides borealis (red-cockaded woodpecker), Aristida stricta (wiregrass)-dominated ground cover, and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones, can predict a diverse and ecologically functional ecosystem. Such indicators are linked to critical structural and functional features of the system and reflect previous land management histories that suggest sustainable approaches.Conclusions: A traditional definition of 'old-growth' relying on overstorey may be limited in describing important features of healthy, diverse Pinus palustris ecosystems. Some characteristics are significantly more important for maintenance of diversity than age of the trees and these features may be present in old- or second-growth forests. We advocate that the management history, structural characteristics and landscape context of stands that harbour desirable conservation attributes (red-cockaded woodpeckers, wiregrass, gopher tortoises and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones) can be used as indicators to identify important conservation and forest management principles."	38	0	0	0	36	0	52	2006-05-01	WOS:000242292500009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Weed community responses were examined in a corn-soybean intercrop in southwestern Michigan, USA, with and without nitrogen fertilization. Weed suppression was observed when intercropping was additive, but the depression in above-ground weed biomass was not due to a synergistic effect of crop diversity, but rather to the effects of crop density and identity. Intercropping did not have a greater suppressive effect than monocrops on weed biomass in a replacement intercrop when crop densities were similar to those in monocultures. Similarly, intercropping per se did not alter the diversity, species richness or composition of the weed community. The presence and density of corn was more important in affecting the weed community than was the density of soybeans or than intercropping itself.

Generalist species are able to persist in a broad range of habitats, whereas specialist species are adapted to a restricted range of environmental conditions. Cities host a great heterogeneity of habitats with variable degrees of human impact. This is generally reflected in the functional composition of the urban floras. The aim of our study is thus to explore whether the degree of functional specialization of urban plant assemblages varies among habitats subject to different degrees of human impact and disturbance regimes. Location: Thirty-two cities in Central Europe with more than 100,000 inhabitants. Methods: We used a data set containing plots of urban floras sampled in seven habitat types within each city: historical city square, boulevard, residential area with a compact building pattern, residential area with an open building pattern, city park, early successional site, and mid-successional site. These habitats differ in the level of human impact, ranging from moderately urbanized suburban habitats to the most urbanized habitats in the city center. For each plot, we calculated a recently introduced specialization index, which is based on the application of concentration measures to Grime's community-level mean CSR strategies. Results: Along the urbanization gradient, from peripheral to central habitats, we observed a marked intensification in the degree of functional specialization of urban habitats, which is primarily attributable to an increase in the selection of ruderal species. Conclusions: Urban ecosystems are characterized by a wide variety of human impacts that affect the functioning of the resident species. Considering cities as heterogeneous systems is thus of paramount importance for understanding the mechanisms that drive the assembly of urban floras."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2024-09-02	WOS:001299757000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Plant diversity in the understorey is the most important component of aboveground biodiversity in plantations and plays a critical role in the sustainable development of plantations. Thinning has been proven effective in promoting the regeneration of understorey plants, and most studies have targeted the effects of thinning on a single biodiversity index (e.g. species richness) of the understorey in plantations. The effects of thinning on functional and phylogenetic diversity are less addressed, however, which could limit the full understanding of biodiversity maintenance and potential processes of community assembly integrally in plantations after thinning.Location Northeast China.Methods We chose young and middle-aged larch (Larix kaempferi) plantations based on the time after thinning (short term, 1-3 years; medium term, 4-9 years; and long term, 10 years or longer), quantified the functional and phylogenetic diversity and the structure of regenerated woody plants in the understorey, and related the functional and phylogenetic diversity to environmental factors (canopy openness and soil nutrients).Results Functional richness and evenness decreased over time after thinning in two types of plantations, and in the medium term the functional divergence of young plantations was significantly lower. At short term after thinning, the phylogenetic diversity was higher in two types of plantations. Functional richness was significantly related to canopy openness in young plantations, while functional divergence was closely related to soil phosphorus content in middle-aged plantations. Functional and phylogenetic structure of the regenerated woody community changed from dispersion to clustering and had a significant relationship with environmental conditions (e.g. light availability in both young and middle-aged plantations), highlighting that environmental filtering gradually became the main driving force of community assembly in the regenerated community of the understorey.Conclusion The functional and phylogenetic diversity of regenerated woody plants changed over time after thinning under the influence of light availability, and environmental filtering played a crucial role in the assembly of the understorey community.

Drought effects will reflect ecosystems' sensitivity (i.e. the magnitude of the response relative to the change in amount of precipitation), with different consequences for plant communities and ecosystem functioning. However, sensitivity estimations across ecosystems and among years are contingent upon the metric applied. Here, we asked how different sensitivity indices reflect the responses to drought in contrasting ecosystems. Methods We proposed a novel index to estimate sensitivity in drought experiments, which consider the change in the response variable in relation to the reduction in precipitation, standardized by the mean precipitation use efficiency of the site, making it suitable to compare among contrasting ecosystems. We compared the information gained from the new index with two indices commonly used in experimentally induced droughts, through simulated scenarios. Besides, we applied the indices to data from previous field drought experiments to evaluate relative and absolute sensitivity to drought in worldwide grassland ecosystems along a wide precipitation gradient. Results We found that both relative and absolute approaches yielded important information to determine drought sensitivity in different simulated scenarios and under interannual precipitation variability. When the indices were applied to real situations, relative sensitivity to drought showed a significant increase as mean annual precipitation decreases whereas absolute sensitivity did not change significantly with precipitation. Conclusions Our findings highlighted that absolute and relative indices to estimate drought sensitivity, rather than being redundant, may complement each other to inform how ecosystems respond to drought and to provide a more holistic assessment of vulnerable systems toward increasing interannual precipitation variability. This complementary approach enhances our understanding of ecosystem response under different conditions of precipitation variability and of the mechanisms that determine ecosystem changes during extreme droughts."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2022-08-30	WOS:000843627200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Above-ground biomass of C.epigejos and vegetation composition of each of the plots were monitored every year from 2013 to 2016. To assess the effects of treatments, we analysed biomass production of C.epigejos, herb layer cover and vegetation composition.ResultsBoth sowing R.major and an additional autumn meadow cut significantly suppressed C.epigejos. Their effects were additive and of comparable size. Both treatments also had significant but markedly different effects on community composition. Rhinanthus major facilitated directional community composition change towards the regional Brachypodio-Molinetum meadows. In contrast, increased mowing intensity significantly decreased frequency of threatened species, which however may have also been influenced by R.major.ConclusionsSowing of autochthonous R.major seeds was demonstrated as an efficient tool to suppress C.epigejos and facilitate community restoration. It can be combined with an additional meadow cut to further accelerate decline of the grass. The additional cut should however be used as a short-term practice (1-2years) only to minimize potential negative effects of its long-term application on some threatened plant species. The effects of R.major are comparable to those of Rhinanthus alectorolophus reported previously. As a species occurring naturally in species-rich dry grasslands, R.major has a broader and longer-term application potential than R.alectorolophus in ecological restoration and conservation of these communities."	20	0	0	0	18	0	20	2018-03-13	WOS:000425120600012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

As a result, thousands of abandoned charcoal kiln platforms still occur in present-day woodlands. Because of peculiar light and soil properties, the understorey vegetation at these platforms may differ from the surrounding stands. Our study investigated, for the first time, the effects of abandoned kiln platforms on understorey vegetation diversity, composition and biomass production in forests of a Mediterranean area.Location: Tuscany, central Italy.Methods: One 3 9 3 m kiln plot on charcoal kiln area and one 3 9 3 m control plot in the surrounding stands were established in 59 representative sites located in three major forest types dominated by evergreen sclerophylls, deciduous oaks and beech. In each plot, diversity and composition of the understorey community were analysed, together with soil factors (content of C, N, C: N ratio, pH) and light conditions (PAR). A 50 9 50 cm frame was randomly placed in each plot to measure biomass production.Results: The charcoal kiln habitat positively affected understorey diversity and above-ground biomass, as well as the content of C, C: N ratio, pH and light availability. Significant compositional differences between the two plot types occurred, although to a variable extent for the three forest types. Graminoids were more abundant on kiln plots, and 12 indicator species were found for this habitat in deciduous oak forests. Higher values of cover and biomass showed the lack of detrimental effects of wood charcoal accumulation on understorey productivity.Conclusions: Long-term wood charcoal production in Mediterranean woodlands has caused long-lasting effects on the understorey via persistent changes in abiotic factors. Hence, former kiln platforms represent anthropogenic microhabitats that increase biodiversity and fine-scale heterogeneity of forest ecosystems. Conservation measures are advocated to preserve them against various external threats."	32	0	0	0	20	0	36	2016-10-26	WOS:000384751300012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

We aimed to develop a low-cost, but reasonably accurate, estimation technique within early-successional Bahamian broadleaf shrub vegetation.LocationEleuthera, The Bahamas.MethodsOur biomass estimation technique was based on a visual obstruction method originally developed for use in grassland vegetation, but modified to suit our mixed vegetation structure. Visual obstruction measures were recorded for a total of 90 0.25-m(2) quadrats from which all standing vegetation was subsequently collected, dried and weighed. Regression models were then developed to predict vegetation dry weight (biomass) from visual obstruction.ResultsThe field time and equipment costs required to obtain our visual obstruction measures were low, and the accuracy of our above-ground plant biomass predictions was on par with that reported for other estimation techniques. Should increased accuracy or additional structural information be desired, our basic technique can be enhanced by adding other easily obtained measures (e.g. woody stem circumference).ConclusionsOur low-cost technique yields reasonably accurate estimates of above-ground plant biomass and should be transferable to any shrubland vegetation type where the maximum height of vegetation is typically below 2m."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2014-04-30	WOS:000332774800016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

We aim to understand how these two variables vary throughout the growing season in sub-alpine grasslands. How do productivity and phenology (quality) of different plant communities within a landscape vary over time? Do productivity and phenology co-vary? Which environmental constraints or growth form composition best explain differences in productivity and phenology among plant communities? Location Calcareous sub-alpine grasslands, the external Alps, France. Methods We assessed how productivity (above-ground biomass) and phenology varied with date, slope, radiation and altitude among seven plant communities. Then we explored (1) co-variation among maximum biomass, the date of maximum biomass and average community flowering date for each plant community, and (2) whether these variables were related to snow regime or growth form composition. Results Temporal dynamics of biomass and phenology varied markedly among plant communities. More productive communities reached their maximum biomass later. Flowering occurred after the biomass peak, except for one plant community. However, the later the biomass peak, the shorter the lag to flowering peak. The timing of flowering and date of maximum biomass were best explained by differences in snow regimes among communities. The impact of growth form composition was marginal. Conclusions Plant communities are under strong time constraints to grow and flower. Snowmelt regime plays a crucial role at one end of the growing season, while time left for fruiting and maturing is likely to influence the other end. Sub-alpine grassland communities are highly heterogeneous in productivity, timing of maximum productivity and flowering phenology, creating small-scale variability in the forage quality and quantity available to large herbivores."	28	2	0	0	20	0	28	2013-04-03	WOS:000315690500015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, site-specific factors such as soil type may cause differential temporal herb layer changes within a single study area under comparable external pressure. Surprisingly, relatively few studies have examined herb layer changes on different site types within the same forest complex. The aim of this study is to determine the temporal differences in herb vegetation and to compare these for two differing site types in the same forest complex. Location Ancient broad-leaved woodlands traditionally managed as coppice with standards in South Belgium, an area with secondary deposits and a mild temperate climate. Methods In 2008 we re-inventoried 43 vegetation recordings from 1953 to 1954 in forests on two site types (acid and neutral forests). First, we described differences in soil pH, litter and overstorey characteristics between the sites. Next, multivariate analysis, Ellenberg indicator value and CSR signature were used to determine differences in herb layer diversity and composition between both the two survey times and the two site types. Finally, we analysed temporal differences in individual species abundances and frequencies. Results The two site types clearly differed with respect to soil, litter and overstorey characteristics. Temporal changes between the surveys were mostly highly significant on the neutral sites and mostly not significant on the acid sites. On both site types, the species pool size declined. On the neutral site, the mean plot species richness also declined. Based on the plant-derived characteristics (Ellenberg indicator values) of the plots, light availability decreased and nitrogen availability significantly increased on the neutral sites. Conclusion Input of eutrophying deposits and management changes are seen as key drivers of herb layer changes in the study area over the last half-century. However, our study suggests that site characteristics such as parent material and soil pH should also be considered. Together with the key drivers, incorporating differences in site characteristics may improve our understanding of temporal shifts in herb layer vegetation in response to environmental change."	41	0	0	0	33	0	41	2013-04-01	WOS:000315690500009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Secondary forest types were: Vismia (on land formerly clear-cut, used for pasture and intensively burned) and Cecropia (no pasture usage or intensive fires after clear-cut).Results: A principal components analysis indicated that most of the primary forest species exhibited a similar habit and were characterized by short shoots and small, round leaves with low specific leaf area, whereas secondary forest species had a broad range of trait values. At the plot level, primary and secondary forest communities were separated mainly by plant length and leaf size. Plant size varied more within secondary than within primary forest plots. The two secondary forest types could not be separated based on the traits of liana regeneration. Relative growth rate (RGR) did not correlate significantly with any measured plant trait, except for a negative relation to initial length. RGR increased with decreasing canopy cover and was highest in Vismia forest plots.Conclusion: Plant functional traits of liana regeneration were more similar in the primary forest and differed substantially from secondary forests, yet canopy cover only partly explained the observed differences."	4	0	0	0	5	0	5	2012-02-16	WOS:000299207600011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Do the effects on the plant community persist over an extended recovery period?LocationFlooding Pampa grasslands, Argentina (36 degrees 30' S, 58 degrees 30' W).MethodsWe assessed the effects of 40-d of flooding, trampling and the combination thereof on plant cover and biomass, vertical distribution of foliage and floristic composition in lowland grassland mesocosms. We considered a 120-d recovery period to evaluate the persistence of flooding and trampling effects on the plant community.ResultsFlooding, with or without trampling, increased cover and biomass of the graminoid species, especially marsh grasses, which developed a taller canopy, whereas most of the forb species were negatively affected. This was enhanced by trampling, as the aerial biomass of the dominant legume Lotus tenuis decreased by 90%, while three major forb species disappeared. Trampling under flooding conditions did not reduce the total above-ground biomass production, as the growth enhancement of graminoids was enough to compensate for the breakdown of the forbs. Below-ground biomass was lower when both perturbations occurred simultaneously. After 120-d of recovery, graminoids continued to be dominant while the remaining forbs (including L. tenuis) recovered only partially. Below-ground biomass recovered fully at the end of the growing season.ConclusionsThe combination of flooding and trampling shifts the community co-dominance of graminoids and forbs towards a persistent dominance of graminoid species. When both perturbations are combined, the above-ground production of the grassland is unaffected and root biomass is rapidly recovered. However, the loss of the legume L. tenuis deserves attention because this is the unique nitrogen-fixing species of the ecosystem, which improves the forage quality for livestock production."	34	2	0	0	25	0	37	2011-02-01	WOS:000286207100010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

We characterized the position of woodlands along the urban-rural gradient by examining adjacent land cover. By using an ordination analysis (RLQ), we analysed which traits out of -23 tested were related to the contrasted distribution of species along the urban-rural gradient.Results: Species that are more likely to be found in urban woodlands than rural woodlands have different persistence traits (higher specific leaf area, more often rosette or semi-rosette form, less underground vegetative multiplication), resource requirements (affinity for base-rich and fertile soils) and regeneration traits (short life-span). Dispersion traits were not related to the distribution of species along the urban-rural gradient.Conclusions: Our approach identifies traits that can help to determine the vulnerability of forest species as a result of the environmental changes that follow urbanization.

The propagation of rainfall perturbations on vegetation was calculated using cross-correlations between monthly seasonally adjusted (SA) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and SA antecedent rainfall at different time-scales.ResultsIn this region, El Nino events are associated with higher than normal winter precipitation (probability of 73%). Opposite but more predictable effects are found for La Nina events (89% probability of dry events). Chaparral and evergreen forests showed the longest persistence of rainfall effects (0-8 months). Grasslands and wetlands showed low persistence (0-2 months), with wetlands dominated by non-stationary patterns. Within the region, the NDVI spatial patterns associated with higher (lower) rainfall are homogeneous (heterogeneous), with the exception of evergreen forests.ConclusionsKnowledge of the time-scale of lagged effects of the non-seasonal component of rainfall on vegetation greenness, and the risk of winter rainfall anomalies lays the foundation for developing a forecasting model for vegetation greenness.

Logging residues constitute a shelter in clear-cut areas and therefore concerns have been expressed that their removal Could make the ground and its vegetation more exposed to extreme micro-climatic conditions. We asked whether logging residues and forest edges can protect ground-dwelling forest bryophytes from fatal microclimate events following clear-cutting.Location: Boreal forests of central Sweden.Methods: Using transplants of eight forest floor bryophyte species we experimentally analysed the sheltering effect (less solar radiation and less wind) of logging residues and forest edges in seven clear-cut areas. Transplants were placed in two contrasting positions in each area; near a north-facing forest edge and in the centre of the clear-cut area. In each position, half of the transplants were covered by a layer of spruce branches and the other half was left uncovered. We estimated proportion of apparently living shoots (apparent vitality) and measured radial growth of transplants during one growing season.Results: Position in the clear-cut area, but not cover of spruce branches, clearly influenced radial growth. Vitality scores were higher among transplants covered with branches and the lowest apparent vitality,vas observed in uncovered transplants in the middle of clear-cut areas. The change in area of apparently living shoots during the Course of the experiment (growth minus mortality was unaffected by branch cover close to the edge but positively affected in the centre of the clear-cut area. In general, the effect of branch cover on bryophytes was higher in the centre of clear-cut areas. Here, climatic measurements showed that branch cover buffers during periods of extreme microclimates.Conclusions: Extraction of logging residues after clear-felling may reduce the survival of some ground-dwelling forest organisms. The additional sheltering provided by branches was unimportant close to forest edges. We suggest smaller clear-cut areas., green-tree retention and other ways to make logged areas shadier and less windy to mitigate the reduced shelter caused by harvest of logging residues."	34	0	0	0	33	0	41	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Do changes in the vegetation structure negatively affect the regeneration of the dominant species Calluna vulgaris? Is cutting an alternative method of conserving the diversity and maintaining the structure of heathlands in the Canabrian Mountains?Location: Calluna vulgaris heathlands on the southern slopes of the Cantabrian Mountain range, NW Spain.Methods: A total of 60 plots were treated with different combinations of cutting and twice the estimated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (56 kg-N.ha(-1).yr(-1)). The changes in the cover values of the species present were monitored over a five year study period. The cover values were used to calculate abundance and species richness.Results: Fertilizing, with nitro-en allows biodiversity to increase over time. However, the greatest biodiversity is associated with the cutting plus fertilization treatment, since cutting allows gaps to be opened that are easily colonized by pioneer annual species, white fertilization mainly favours an increase in the mean number of perennial herbs (graminoids and forbs). Increased perennial herb richness also corresponds to a rise in their cover values. The recovery of the dominant woody species in these communities, Calluna vulgaris, is not impeded by the increase in perennial herbs species' cover values.Conclusions: In the Calluna vulgaris heathlands studied, cutting plus fertilization allowed an increase in biodiversity over time. No displacement of the dominant woody species, Calluna vulgaris, is observed due to the presence of the perennial herbs. Cutting patches of heathland is recommended as a mechanism for maintaining high vegetation diversity, when grazing is not possible."	28	0	0	0	21	0	29	2007-04-01	WOS:000245934700006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Spatial pattern was assessed using geostatistics. Contributions of each determinant to within-site heterogeneity in predicted Betula seedling densities were estimated by varying variables over their full and interquartile ranges in a statistical model derived from experimental data.Results: Salient spatial trends were revealed: strong autocorrelation over distances of < 50 m for soil factors and more extensive autocorrelation (0 to > 150 m) in vegetation variables and Betula seed bank densities. The latter resulted in single across-site gradients, the former small, distinct patches. All patterns were overlain with variance that was present at distances of < 17.6 m. Variables displaying spatial pattern also accounted for within-site heterogeneity in predicted Betula seedling densities but their relative contribution to this varied between sites.Conclusions: Identifiable spatial autocorrelation in factors controlling patch-scale invasion patterns allows managers to target invasion prone patches, potentially reducing management intensities.

Many of these dams generate daily fluctuating flows known as hydropeaking to meet sub-daily variation in energy demands. Hydropeaking can significantly impact riparian plant communities, with obligate riparian species tending to experience the greatest negative effects on habitat suitability. Whether this pattern holds in arid biomes where daily soil moisture enhancements could benefit some plants is an open question.LocationColorado River, Grand Canyon, Western USA.MethodsWe used occurrence records to model species responses to variation in daily flow fluctuations across 32 689 river segments in the Western United States. We then applied estimates of hydropeaking responses derived from those models to understanding the abundance and fine scale hydrologic niches of riparian plant species in the Colorado River ecosystem downstream of Glen Canyon Dam, which has experienced vegetation expansion attributed to river regulation, including hydropeaking that began in 1964.ResultsAt the regional scale, species with greater wetland dependence exhibited increasingly negative responses to hydropeaking across 1 496 species, consistent with previous studies at smaller scales. At the local scale of the Colorado River, we found that species inhabiting near-channel habitat characterized by daily inundation and exposure had positive modeled responses to hydropeaking, consistent with a long history of selection for species tolerant of hydropeaking. In contrast, species inhabiting the zone immediately above peak daily river stage had negative modeled responses to hydropeaking, suggesting that they are being excluded from otherwise suitable habitat nearer the channel.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that hydropeaking can impact species distributions from local to regional scales by excluding obligate wetland species and reducing habitat suitability for some facultative wetland species. These results from an arid river system are consistent with those reported from other biomes."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-07-29	WOS:001534275300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

In addition, we surveyed all vascular plant species per plot for each removal method and control.Results: We found that the uprooting treatment resulted in a higher number of resprouting stumps and lower number of resprouts, and a smaller resprout height and diameter. The fire treatment showed the greatest reduction in the number of resprouting stumps and resprouts, whereas glyphosate treatment showed intermediate results although resprout height and diameter were significantly greater compared with the uprooting treatment. Whereas plant species richness and diversity were higher in the fire treatment, they were adversely affected in the uprooting treatment.Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that none of the woody removal methods were effective enough to completely eradicate D. cinerea from the field trials after only one intervention, suggesting the need for follow-up management actions considering their impacts on both woody encroachment and biodiversity restoration."	6	0	0	0	5	0	6	2023-08-21	WOS:000959347200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Species were assigned native, archaeophyte (i.e. alien species introduced before c. 1492 CE) or neophyte (i.e. alien species introduced after c. 1492 CE) status. Results The AgriWeedClim database version 1.0 contains georeferenced data from 32,889 vegetation plots sampled from 1916 to 2019. Conclusions We provide an overview of this new resource and present example analyses to show its content and possible applications. We outline potential research questions including analysis of patterns and causes of vegetation changes in arable habitats from the early 20th century to the present."	7	0	0	0	6	0	7	2022-08-18	WOS:000837330500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	YES

Crop type and management are key filtering factors of functional traits in the weed communities of regions with contrasting soils and climates	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	24	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12622	10.1111/avsc.12622	Article	OCT-DEC 2021	2021	"QuestionsWeed community composition responds to the interactions between environmental and management factors at different scales. The aim of this study was to disentangle the relative contributions of factors defining the composition of weed communities through crop type and agronomic management at the field scale, and climate and soil factors at the regional scale.LocationThe study was carried out in croplands in the phytogeographic provinces of Espinal and Pampas in central Argentina.MethodsThe floristic and functional compositions of weed communities in maize and soybean crops were characterized and compared using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and non-metric multidimensional scaling in the two regions. The Espinal and the Pampas differ in soil and climatic characteristics, but crops are grown with similar management strategies due to the widespread use of no-tillage and agrochemicals.ResultsYears of continuous cropping, previous crop and sowing date were the most important factors modulating the species composition of both crops at field scale. Perennials and exotics were more abundant in the Pampas, whereas natives were more abundant in the Espinal. Moreover, mechanically dispersed species were more abundant in maize crops in the Pampas. Annuals and barochoric species were closely related to the years of continuous cropping in maize. In soybean, more monocotyledonous species were observed in fields previously cropped with maize, whereas more dicotyledonous and C-3 species were observed in fields previously cropped with soybean.ConclusionsDifferences in species composition depend mainly on climatic and biogeographical factors. In contrast, the functional composition of the weed communities in maize and soybean is mostly determined by local factors at field level, which are mostly related to crop identity and agronomic management. The effects of farming practices determine the functional composition of weed communities, which makes crop rotation and thorough cleaning of harvester machines key strategies in the development of weed management."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Response of taxonomic and functional diversity to disturbance severity in temperate hardwood forests	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	24	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/avsc.12538	Article	JAN 2021	2021	"Aims: Quantify changes in taxonomic and functional diversity (FD) and identity to determine if responses to a disturbance severity gradient follow a colonization/competition hypothesis: diversity will (a) increase with disturbance severity as more open conditions favor species with traits linked to colonization; and (b) become more similar between regeneration and overstorey layers as environmental filtering favors species with traits linked to increasing competition for light.Location: North Carolina, USA.Methods: Taxonomic (richness [S], evenness [E], and Shannon diversity [H ']) and functional diversity (richness [F-Ric], evenness [F-Eve], and dispersion [F-Dis]) and identities were calculated for regeneration and overstorey before and after restoration treatments: control (CONT); undesirable subcanopy stems removed via herbicide (HERB); repeated burning (RRXF); and timber harvest followed by burning (HARV).Results: In the overstorey, HARV affected taxonomic and FD. In HARV, S and H ' were lower than in other treatments. At high levels of species richness, F-Eve was lower in HARV than in HERB and RRXF. Similarly, at high levels of species richness, F-Dis was greater in HARV than other treatments. In the regeneration layer, taxonomic and FD did not differ across treatments during any of the post-treatment years. In the regeneration stratum, HARV increased the means of traits associated with rapid post-disturbance establishment, carbon capture, and maximum height. Greater dissimilarity in composition between the overstorey and regeneration suggests stronger treatment effects on regeneration in HARV than less severe treatments.Conclusion: Patterns do not support the hypothesis that taxonomic diversity increases with disturbance severity or decreases with time after disturbance in the regeneration layer. Of the restoration treatments tested in this study, only HARV affected aspects of functional identity of the regeneration stratum; even so, FD remained unchanged. In mixed Quercus forests, functional identity rather than taxonomic or FD may provide insight into nuanced effects of restoration treatments on ecosystem function."	5	0	0	0	5	0	6	2020-12-03	WOS:000590601700001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

What role does plant provenance play? Can biotic interactions such as nurse effect of the overstorey and shrub layer buffer the negative responses to plant translocation? Are any of these effects species-specific?Location: Three pinewoods in the Catalan Pre-Pyrenees, northeast Iberian Peninsula.Methods: We used a replicated field trial to test the early years establishment of two contrasted provenances of four Quercus species (Q. coccifera, Q. ilex, Q. faginea and Q. pubescens) that were sown and planted along gradients of elevation and understorey microsite conditions in sub-Mediterranean pinewoods. Seedling responses to translocation were evaluated through seedling emergence, seedling survival and re-sprouting after dieback events according to seedling provenance, thermal migration distance, extreme cold events and microenvironment.Results: The study reports high success of both the planting (with an overall 76.3% of initial 3-yr survival) and sowing (with an overall 50% of seedling emergence) experiments. The results show that: (1) the thermal migration distance and the occurrence of extreme cold events have strong effects on the responses of the translocated species (particularly the evergreen oaks); (2) the forest overstorey plays an important role in attenuating the negative effects of thermal migration distance on seedling survival; and (3) these responses are species-specific. The evergreen Quercus species showed more evidence of high ecotypic differentiation in terms of cold tolerance, enabling local provenances to respond better to translocation. In contrast, marcescent species, showed high phenotypic plasticity that led to a better overall establishment success.Conclusion: The implementation of assisted migration is a feasible option to increase the diversity and resilience of the sub-Mediterranean pinewoods. Assisted migration programmes should manage risks by thoroughly considering thermal migration distances and the occurrence of extreme cold events when selecting species and seed sources, since Mediterranean tree species show different strategies regarding adaptation to cold. Programme managers should also consider the advantage of planting/sowing under relatively closed canopy to buffer some of the negative responses associated with translocation."	13	0	0	0	7	0	15	2016-04-01	WOS:000374545600010	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A new network of permanent sample plots in logged forests, the Tropical managed Forests Observatory (TmFO), aims to fill this gap by providing unprecedented opportunities to examine long-term data on the resilience of logged tropical forests at regional and global scales.

Here we ask whether seemingly benign repeated surveys themselves significantly affect stand dynamics and plant species diversity when implementing long-term monitoring of permanent plots.LocationOld-growth semi-deciduous tropical forest of M'Baiki, Central African Republic.MethodsWe compared demographic parameters of trees (DBH9.55cm) and plant community diversity and composition across three zones of three permanent plots: along trails crossing a plot, in areas adjacent to trails and in the forest interior. We assessed differences in radial growth, mortality, recruitment and species diversity using ANOVA. We examined the dynamics of tree death over time using Cox proportional hazards regression models. We analysed plant species composition using permutational multivariate ANOVA and indicator species analyses.ResultsTree mortality, recruitment and radial growth did not differ among the three zones. Species richness and evenness did not differ among the three zones investigated, but species composition did, with significantly different indicator species between trails and forest interiors. In trails, communities were characterized by light-demanding small trees and lianas and shade-tolerant herbs of trampled soils, whilst forest interiors exhibited more shade-tolerant tree species.ConclusionsEven in observational studies conducted in the wild, visitors may unintentionally but artificially influence the natural patterns and processes under investigation, an influence whose intensity may depend upon study design, habitat type and natural disturbance regimes. Permanent plots may not be a benign influence on the study system, as is generally assumed, and responses to repeated visitation may place fundamental limits on the questions that can be addressed, especially when species composition is assessed under low levels of natural disturbances or high density of trails."	10	0	0	0	7	0	12	2014-11-05	WOS:000342839200014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

To what extent can mined site conditions support the establishment of rare plant species assemblies that are locally novel but of regional conservation value? What effects have dispersal limitation and stochasticity on spontaneous succession trajectories and how does community structure and composition differ between actively restored sites and ancient grasslands?LocationCentral German Lignite Mining District.MethodsWe used comprehensive databases to compare floristic composition in mined sites and their surroundings. At the community level, we choose a chronosequence approach to analyse spontaneous colonization of target species into mined sites and the development of calcareous grasslands, compared to ancient as well as actively restored grasslands. Statistical analyses involved Mann-Whitney U-test, GNMDS and binary logistic regression.ResultsThe proportion of neophytes in spontaneously developing mined sites was low and similar to the unmined surroundings at the landscape unit as well as plant community scale. Mined sites harbour an impressive number of native and even rare species. However, plant communities lacking immigration of target grasses typical for calcareous grasslands lead to divergences regarding species and functional composition compared to ancient calcareous grasslands. In contrast, plots with actively introduced target species at the onset of succession show a generally more rapid trajectory towards ancient grasslands. The probability of establishing in mined sites increases with higher abundance of calcareous dry grassland species in the vicinity, indicating the importance of high propagule pressure in a landscape context, whereas long-distance dispersal traits were significant, but less important.ConclusionsSpontaneous succession supports the development of native plant communities. However, because of propagule limitation, colonization processes may lead to novel species assemblies. While dispersal stochasticity during spontaneous succession results in a higher gamma-diversity, species introduction supports faster trajectories towards desired reference states providing important ecosystem services such as erosion control. The key decision of whether to rely on spontaneous succession or not mainly depends on the surrounding landscape matrix and history, the need for erosion control and/or rapid compensation for lost habitats."	41	4	0	0	37	0	52	2014-04-30	WOS:000332774800010	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What is the best method to analyze this relationship, given that native species occur in very low numbers and are absent from many locations?Location: California, USA.Methods: We investigated the effects of soil characteristics and livestock grazing on native plant occurrence at 40 plots from six sites during the period 2003-2005. Low absolute cover (< 5.8%) of native species resulted in strongly skewed, zero-inflated data sets. To overcome problems in the analysis created by non-normality and correlations within plots, we used GLMs and GLMMs, either with a Poisson or a negative binomial distribution, to analyse native species richness and Nassella pulchra cover.Results: N. pulchra cover was strongly associated with low phosphorus in sandy soils, whereas native species richness was highest in soils with low available nitrogen (high C: N).Conclusion: Under current conditions, phosphorus seems to be a critical factor influencing abundance of N. pulchra. Low fertility soils may provide refugia for native species in highly invaded California grasslands as they may be below a threshold required for non-native annuals to completely dominate.

Patches formed by these species are destined to be replaced by other species during primary succession and in order to persist in the area they have to continuously colonize new areas. We studied whether the displacement of the species could be slowed down and their sexual and/or vegetative reproduction enhanced by management targeted to surrounding vegetation.Location: Bothnian Bay, Baltic Sea, W Finland.Methods: Vegetation surrounding patches of all study species was mown in four successional growing seasons. Moreover, the impact of additional soil turning on creating new favourable groving sites was tested for A. fulva.Results: Deterioration of suitable habitats of A. julva and P. nutans was markedly slowed down by management and the vegetative and/or sexual reproduction of these species was enhanced. In the case of R phryganodes, however, no positive response to management was obtained.Conclusions: In order to improve the long-term persistence of these three species successional vegetation changes should be s owed down and their dispersal and colonization success improved by continuous management of the populations. We further suggest that the colonization of new areas should be aided by transplantations to the non-vegetated islets, which have recently risen from the sea and cannot be reached by means of dispersal."	9	0	0	0	8	0	9	2007-04-01	WOS:000245934700004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

The ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total phosphorus (DIN:TP) and nutrient enrichment bio-assays were used to investigate temporal changes in nutrient limitation.Results: Primary production in the new lake was phytoplankton-driven due to the scarcity of recolonizing macrophytes. Phytoplankton growth was initially phosphorus-limited. The runoff of phosphate fertilizer from an adjacent coniferous forestry plantation raised the TP concentration of lake water 5.5-fold. Consequently, the biovolume of phytoplankton increased 30-fold, and chlorophyll-a concentrations increased eightfold, reaching hyper-eutrophic levels. A concurrent depletion of nitrogen in lake water reduced the DIN:TP ratio from 17.8 to 0.6, and phytoplankton growth rapidly became nitrogen-limited. Phytoplankton composition shifted from dinoflagellates to minute, unicellular chlorophytes, with a coincident decline in species diversity.

We examined the functional response of non-native and native assemblages and the relative contribution of intraspecific variation to road disturbance and elevation.LocationCord & oacute;n del Plata Provincial Park, Andes, Argentina.MethodsWe used the functional ecology approach. We calculated community-weighted means (CWM) and functional divergence of leaf area, SLA, LDMC, and plant height of natives and non-natives in transects along elevation, at roadsides and 52 m away from the road. We used linear models to assess changes with elevation and disturbance and estimated the contribution of intraspecific variability using variance partitioning.ResultsNon-natives showed more acquisitive traits than natives. Non-natives responded only to elevation by lower stature and LDMC and higher SLA. For native species, road proximity was related to more acquisitive foliar traits, while community leaf area, SLA, and plant height varied with elevation. Species turnover explained most of the variability observed in the CWMs in both species' origin. The contribution of intraspecific variability was greater in non-native species.ConclusionsHuman disturbance affects the functional composition of native species. In contrast, the community traits of non-natives did not differ between road edges and the interior plots, suggesting that they are not affected by disturbance.

A reforestation plan was also developed using various connectivity metrics and was then compared with that proposed by the Ecuadorian Ministry of the Environment.ResultsBetween 1990 and 2018, 2647 km2 of dry forest was lost in the study area. Former forest areas were put mainly to agricultural uses, which increased by 12.96%. The total number of patches decreased from 6908 to 5357, signifying a loss of 30% of the forest area and leading to losses of up to 75% of connectivity. Areas with low connectivity and a risk of disappearance were identified, and a new reforestation plan was proposed, which was based on maximising connectivity with small patches.ConclusionsBecause of the fragmentation, the connectivity of the seasonal dry forest in Ecuador is dramatically decreasing in the last decades. Therefore, the reforestation plans should prioritise areas whose reforestation increases habitat functional connectivity, which could provide more benefits than increasing the forest area without considering the global connectivity.The Ecuadorian dry forest in the last 28 years has been deforested (mainly for agriculture), fragmented and has lost connectivity at worrying levels. Large patches have been fragmented and small patches and other types of forest that are essential for connectivity have been deforested. A reforestation plan was prepared to maximise connectivity with the smallest area possible.image"	6	1	0	0	4	0	7	2024-04-12	WOS:001196852500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Are successful adaptations for colonisation shared by phylogenetically related species? Location Czech Republic, Central Europe. Methods We used two indices of plant species' colonisation ability (developed from an extensive dataset of dated successional series for 1,531 plant species of the Czech Republic): index of colonisation potential (ICP), which is corrected for mass effect (species' frequency in the landscape acquired from Czech National Phytosociological Database, accounting for more common colonisation events of frequent species), and index of colonisation success (ICS), which is solely based on actual species frequencies in disturbed habitats. We also used preferences for successional age (median of age of sites that species had colonised). We correlated these indices with plant functional traits for three functional groups (woody species, non-woody perennial polycarpic, and non-woody monocarpic species) either considering the phylogenetic history of a species or not. Results Woody species were the best colonisers and had the highest preferences for late-successional stages. Non-woody monocarpic species had a higher ICP than polycarpic species while their ICS were comparable. The best predictor of colonisation ability of both monocarpic and polycarpic non-woody species was canopy height, indicating importance of competition. Other successful colonisers were species with seed traits promoting dispersal (low seed mass or low seed terminal velocity). We did not find traits suitable for adverse biotic conditions (high specific leaf area, SLA), low canopy height) to be important. Successional age preference of species was indicated mainly by seed traits (seed mass, seed longevity), which highly corresponded with species' phylogenetic history. Conclusions Colonisation of disturbed sites is limited by seed dispersal and competitive interactions rather than an adverse abiotic environment."	10	0	0	0	7	1	10	2020-10-12	WOS:000573710400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Is (a) elevation, a proxy for tidal inundation and thus abiotic conditions, limiting the expanse of Elymus. Does sedimentation increase the spread of Elymus by (b) leading to surface elevation change or does it (c) add nitrogen and thereby allows Elymus to grow in lower elevation? Location Salt marsh at Sonke-Nissen-Koog, Wadden Sea National Park Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Methods The experiment was established in 2007 in the high marsh and consisted of four blocks of 12 m x 8 m. The blocks differed in surface elevation change during the experiment. Each block was subdivided into 24 plots of 1 m x 1 m. The original elevation of all plots in relation to the German ordnance datum (NHN) was assessed at the start of the experiment. Plots within the blocks were randomly assigned to one of the three N fertilization treatments. Within each plot we planted five randomly chosen individuals of Elymus. After four years of treatment, the vegetation composition and cover were recorded in all plots and aboveground biomass was collected. Results Original elevation was found to be a main driver of succession favouring Elymus and other late-successional plants. There was no effect of N fertilization, but a positive effect of surface elevation change on Elymus cover was detected. Conclusions We can conclude that the positive effect of surface elevation change on Elymus is based on the resulting higher elevation and more favourable abiotic conditions caused by sedimentation, but not by the addition of nitrogen with the freshly deposited sediment.

Data storage in EVA does not affect on-going independent development of the contributing databases, which remain the property of the data contributors. EVA uses a prototype of the database management software TURBOVEG 3 developed for joint management of multiple databases that use different species lists. This is facilitated by the SynBioSys Taxon Database, a system of taxon names and concepts used in the individual European databases and their corresponding names on a unified list of European flora. TURBOVEG 3 also includes procedures for handling data requests, selections and provisions according to the approved EVA Data Property and Governance Rules. By 30 June 2015, 61 databases from all European regions have joined EVA, contributing in total 1 027 376 vegetation plots, 82% of them with geographic coordinates, from 57 countries.

We tested three hypotheses: (1) richness, diversity and biomass of aquatic macrophytes are higher in organic rice fields than in conventional ones; (2) aquatic macrophyte species composition in organic rice fields is more similar to that of natural wetlands than to conventional rice fields; and (3) aquatic macrophyte richness, diversity, biomass and species composition in natural wetlands will differ from those of organic and conventional rice fields.LocationCoastal plain of southern Brazil.MethodsWe sampled macrophytes at four conventional crops, four organic crops and four natural intermittent wetlands. We sampled at six different times at each site throughout the rice cultivation cycle.ResultsA total of 55 species was recorded in natural wetlands and 36 species in rice fields, with 23 found in conventional crops and 27 found in organic crops. The richness, biomass and species composition of macrophytes was similar in the two rice production systems and lower than that of natural wetlands over the cultivation cycle studied. Species composition of natural wetlands differed from that of rice crops mainly through the presence of hydrophytes and rushes.ConclusionsSome macrophyte species used rice crops as a complementary habitat, but diversity was lower and composition was different from that of natural wetlands. Both conventional and organic systems negatively impacted macrophyte biodiversity. However, the similar richness and biomass of plants in organic and conventional crops indicated that natural techniques with less impact could be efficient in reducing undesirable plant diversity in agricultural systems."	14	0	0	0	12	2	16	2014-04-01	WOS:000332774800015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

We studied how native elm trees (Ulmus pumila L.) interact with grasses in the semi-arid sandy ecosystem of the Otindag, and how the trees should be arranged to promote ecological restoration.LocationOtindag Sandy Land, Inner Mongolia, northern China.MethodsUsing 40 adult elms, we investigated and compared root depths of the native trees with those of neighbouring grasses. The shallowest elm roots and the deepest grass roots were analysed. Using four singleton elms, we also examined how soil moisture in the different soil layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-40cm) and grass biomass density changed with distance from the corresponding tree trunks in four directions within 19m.ResultsOn average, the shallowest elm roots were 17.6 cm deep at 1m from the elm trunks, and 24.5cm at 3m from the elm trunks, whereas the deepest grass roots were 14 cm deep at 1m from the trunks, and 16.3 cm deep at 3m from the trunks. The moisture content in the 0-20cm layers decreased with distance from 1 to 19m from the singleton elms, but increased along the same distance gradient in the 20-40cm layers. Grass biomass density decreased along the distance gradient, and a logistic model fits this tendency well, which indicates that the grass biomass density levels off at distances of >ca. 9m.ConclusionsGiven the vertical divergence of roots and the horizontal pattern of soil moisture, the adult native trees do not compete for much moisture with grasses. The adult native trees have the potential to facilitate the growth and biomass accumulation of nearby grasses. In the semi-arid sandy ecosystem of the Otindag, native elms can be planted for ecological restoration at intervals of up to 18m."	8	3	0	0	5	0	11	2014-04-01	WOS:000332774800014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Location Rio de la Plata Grasslands in Argentina and Uruguay. Methods A total of 115 paired sites of fast-growing Eucalyptus grandis plantations and adjacent grasslands were used to characterize the magnitude and seasonality of (1) radiation interception by canopies and (2) above-ground net primary productivity based on a time series of MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The response of NDVI to precipitation was explored across temporal scales. Results NDVI in afforested vs. grassland plots presented higher annual averages (1.3-fold), lower seasonal ranges (average relative range of 0.11 vs. 0.29) and delayed growing seasons (2-month shift). Temporally, NDVI was positively associated with precipitation input, showing a correlation with longer periods of precipitation accumulation in tree plantations compared to grasslands (>7 vs. 2-3months). Estimated average annual above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) almost quadrupled as a consequence of replacing grasslands by tree plantations (approximate to 4 vs. approximate to 17Mg dry matter. ha-1yr-1), and this difference was evidenced throughout the whole study period. Conclusions Afforested grasslands intercept more radiation and have higher and more stable ANPP throughout the year, probably as a result of major changes in leaf phenology and root distribution patterns, which in turn allowed better access to water. Changes in carbon uptake can influence climate/biosphere feedbacks and should be considered in land-use planning, especially when grassland afforestation is recommended as a tool to mitigate global warming."	25	0	0	0	17	2	29	2013-07-01	WOS:000319885000005	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA) revealed two strong canonical axes, one related to litter/light and another to cover of Quercus spp. versus J. virginiana. Tree seedlings and woody vines dominated near J. virginiana.

The amount of suitable habitat loss and gain was calculated with three migration options and risk surfaces. Vulnerable and sustainable habitats were identified to evaluate the potential risks and survival of beech forests.Results: The total areas of potential suitable habitats differed considerably depending on the future temperature and precipitation changes. Some areas on the Sea of Japan (SOJ) side showed higher probability of maintaining suitable habitats, whereas there were wider areas in which suitable habitats could not persist under any of the 110 climate change scenarios.Conclusions: The risk surfaces of the suitable habitats showed that decreases in precipitation along with increases in temperature reduced the total areas of suitable habitats. Increases in precipitation with increases in temperature of more than or equal to 2 degrees C always reduce the areas of suitable habitats. Under increased precipitation with a temperature increase of <2 degrees C, the areas of suitable habitats showed an increase, maintenance of the status quo or a decrease, depending on the size of the increase in precipitation.

We then compared species regional abundance and distribution patterns with seed dispersal type (wind dispersed versus non-wind dispersed species), vegetative spread (tussock versus caespitose-running species) and niche breadth (the number of phytosociological alliances in which each species is found).Results: Regional abundance of the species was positively related to niche breadth, but was independent of reproductive traits. Similarly, distribution in human disturbance classes and their changes were associated with niche breadth rather than reproductive traits. In general, the more specialist the species, (i) the more they Lire concentrated in natural habitats, (ii) the less land-cover changes they Lire able to cope with, and (iii) the more they Lire restricted to stable change types, particularly to long-standing natural areas.Conclusions: Ecological plasticity rather than dispersal capacity of dominant perennial monocotyledons determines their regional abundance and their ability to cope with recent and future land-cover changes in Mediterranean wetlands.

At each distance we selected plots on, next to and away from paths of different levels of wear, and the covers and frequencies of plant species were sampled. We used generalized linear mixed models and ordination techniques to test our hypotheses.Results: The effect of the edge penetrated up to 50 m into the forest interior. Only light effects of trampling were found in seemingly untrampled areas, in addition to the direct effects of trampling on the paths. Both trampling and edge effects changed the forest understorey species composition. Trampling changed plant species composition locally on paths, and provided opportunities for new species to establish in previously unbroken forest vegetation. Urban forest edges were characterised by species better adapted to sunny, warm and dry conditions. These species, such as grasses, replaced more sensitive forest species, such as dwarf shrubs and mosses. We observed a large number of light demanding deciduous trees at the edges, which may be one of the factors increasing soil fertility and consequently promoting the high abundance of fast growing species, such as grasses and herbs related to more fertile site types.Conclusions: We recommend that urban forest fragments left within urban development should be at least 2-3 ha in size and that the shape of the patch and the number of potential recreational users should be taken into account when preserving true forest understorey vegetation from the effects of edges and trampling."	78	0	0	0	67	0	90	2008-02-01	WOS:000252958300010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

Do intact (relatively undisturbed) and degraded forests differ in seasonal nutrient storage and therefore potential to ameliorate nutrient pollution?Location: United States, Midwestern region.Methods: We used three sets of paired plots, where intact plots were located close to disturbed woodlands. Herbaceous perennials located in eight 0.25 m(2) quadrats in the plots were harvested (in spring and mid-summer), dried, separated into above-and below-ground plant parts, and weighed to determine biomass. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content of the plant tissues were then determined, and these data combined with biomass to estimate nutrient storage.Results: In spring, intact sites had 62% greater above-ground biomass than disturbed sites and 75% greater below-ground biomass. In summer, below-ground biomass of intact plots was still much greater than that of disturbed plots (73 percent), but above-ground biomass was similar. Nutrient tissue concentration generally did not differ, nor did soil nutrient levels. The disturbed sites were largely missing one group of species, the spring ephemerals, and this accounted for the difference in biomass and nutrient storage between sites.Conclusions: Relatively undisturbed woodlands in our study had a much greater capacity to store nutrients, and therefore ameliorate nutrient pollution, in early spring.

Depending on the size of a targeted additional sample, statistical models for estimating the number of rare species have not been systematically established and compared. Location Global. Methods For fairly comparing and predicting rare-species richness at the same sample-size baseline, we systematically developed and compared four estimators for rarefaction and extrapolation of rare-species richness with a given specific abundance. These four estimators included a uniformly minimum variance unbiased (UMVUE), Bayesian-weighted, Chao-derived unweighted and naive estimator. Results After extensive numerical tests, for conducting rarefaction of rare-species richness (i.e., when additional sample size was not larger than the original one) it is recommended to implement UMVUE, as it has zero bias and coverage percentage closest to 0.95. However, the performance of Bayesian-weighted and Chao-derived estimators is also satisfactory. By contrast, for conducting extrapolation of rare-species richness (i.e., when the additional sample size is larger than the original one), the Bayesian-weighted estimator is recommended, as it has the best performance among the four estimators (here UMVUE is inapplicable). Conclusions There was no absolute winner, as the different estimators have their own merits and are recommended under different settings. When conducting rarefaction of rare-species richness, UMVUE, which has the highest accuracy, is recommended. By contrast, when conducting extrapolation of rare-species richness, the Bayesian-weighted estimator is recommended, as it has the overall best performance.

We investigated how the processes underlying community assembly (i.e. species loss, species gain and changes in abundance of resident species) influenced ecosystem functioning in experimental grassland communities in different states of restoration. Location A greenhouse experiment in northern Flanders, Belgium. Methods We set up a mesocosm experiment with communities of 19 planted species, ranging from slow-growing species from poorly productive Nardus grasslands to fast-growing species from highly productive Lolium perenne grasslands. We categorised the mesocosms into different grassland restoration states based on known abiotic and biotic restoration barriers for semi-natural grassland restoration: soil phosphorus levels and soil biota communities. After two growing seasons, we used the CAFE approach, an ecological application of the Price equation, to partition the effects of plant community assembly on ecosystem functioning (here community productivity) for the different restoration states. Results Adding soil biota communities sampled from reference Nardus grasslands vs more intensively managed grasslands did not have a significant effect on either plant species richness or biomass productivity. Lower soil phosphorus concentrations (i.e. abiotic restoration) resulted in a higher plant species richness. However, the net effect on productivity was close to zero. The increase in productivity caused by species gains was compensated through decreases in productivity caused by species loss and by decreases in the abundance or functioning of species that are present in both abiotically degraded and abiotically restored states. Conclusions Not only species richness but also species identity resulted in changes in ecosystem functioning (i.e. productivity), even though the net functional effects were close to zero. More specifically, we found that species richness-driven increases in productivity were counterbalanced by resource-driven and species identity-driven reductions in productivity."	2	0	0	0	2	0	2	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Each trial was held within a 2 x 2 factorial involving vertebrate seed predator exclusion and midstorey and litter layer removal across a gradient of overstorey basal area (6-25 m(2)). Additionally, we measured Pinus palustris and Pinus taeda germination within each treatment and correlated germinant density to substrate and understorey vegetation cover.Results Granivory generally varied inversely with seed size, with small-seeded Liquidambar styraciflua experiencing the highest (27%) and large-seeded Quercus nigra (7%) and Acer rubrum (6%) the lowest depredation pressure. Pinus palustris and Pinus taeda germinant density was significantly highest where vertebrate seed predators were excluded and the midstorey and litter layer were removed. For both pine species, this result corresponded with a significant positive association with mineral soil and negative associations with hardwood and pine litter where vertebrate predators were excluded. Basal area did not affect granivory or germination for any species.Conclusions Our results demonstrate that granivores did not select Pinus palustris, and that large-seeded species encroachment was less inhibited by seed predators.

We therefore asked: (a) What is the specific composition of vegetation growing on Folic Histosols; (b) can indicator plants be used to detect Folic Histosols in mountain forests; (c) what do functional traits of plant indicators tell about the ecological properties of Folic Histosols? Location Northern Calcareous Alps, south Germany. Methods Based on representative stratified sampling of joint vegetation plots and soil profile descriptions, we estimated the frequency and thickness of Folic Histosols, determined the proportion of compositional variation specifically attributable to forest floor thickness using ordination, applied Indicator Species Analysis and searched for typical traits and ecological requirements of indicator species. Results The co-existence of acidophilic and calciphytic plants is typical for the tessellated occurrence and the successional origin of Folic Histosols. In the study region, the detection of Folic Histosols on pure limestone or dolomite by ground vegetation works very well. Particularly acidophilic plants are suitable indicators for thick forest floors. The indicator value of bryophytes and Ericaceae for Folic Histosols is likely related to the colonization of rotten wood. Folic Histosol indicator species are widely spread in the allocation to sociology group, which ranges from open landscapes to dark forests and reflects successional origin. Conclusions In mountain forests on carbonate bedrock, thick humus layers often occur next to bare rock. This tessellated structure can also be detected in the ground vegetation, where acidophilic and calciphytic plants occur side by side. Thick Folic Histosols in late successional forests are dominated by acidophilic plants colonizing rotten wood.

Does the method of soil handling (turfing or loose-tipping) or the season of transfer determine the outcome?LocationA deciduous ancient coppice woodland in Kent, southeast England.MethodsTwo methods of soil translocation were compared: loose-tipping, involving stripping a layer of topsoil and re-spreading it at a receptor site; and soil placement, in which soil turves were cut and laid intact. The operation also provided an opportunity to observe the effects of seasonal translocation, respectively, in autumn and spring. Soil compaction, texture and chemistry were assessed after translocation, while vegetation cover changes were followed over a 10-yr period.ResultsImmediately after soil transfer, the vegetation community reverted to an earlier successional stage, with bare ground rapidly colonized by annuals and biennials, many germinating from the soil seed bank. By the third year after translocation, a perennial vegetation cover had developed comprising grasses and woodland-edge opportunists as well as most of the original woodland species. After 10yr, bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.) dominated the receptor sites, along with the woodland geophyte bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), while some woodland species became less abundant. Localized soil compaction radically altered species composition. Autumn translocation promoted better immediate recovery of forest species than spring translocation, while soil placement caused less initial damage than loose-tipping. Convergence in vegetation composition in all soil handling treatments was observed towards canopy closure.ConclusionsResults illustrate the importance of conducting translocation operations in the autumn when the vegetation is dormant and soil moisture is low, and point to the need for sensitive soil handling. After 10yr the field layer at the receptor site still resembled that of the donor, but with differences in abundance of some individual species."	8	0	0	0	7	0	9	2015-09-30	WOS:000361181500005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Sampling was performed annually for 5yr (from 2006 to 2010). For comparison, four other land-use types (rain-fed cereal crops, old fields, alpha grass steppes and holm oak forests) were sampled to quantify understorey vegetation community composition and diversity.ResultsAfforestation plots were compositionally distinct from each other within 5yr, mainly as a result of canopy thinning and to a lesser extent, vegetation treatments. Total species richness was highest in the low to medium densities of pines, where richness approached that found in native communities. However, afforestation plots were most similar in diversity, life-form type and composition to abandoned agricultural fields, and large differences were found between afforestation plots, native forests and alpha grass steppes.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that plant species composition in the understorey of pine plantations on former cropland can respond rapidly to common management practices intended to reduce fire risk. In particular, tree thinning increases both understorey plant diversity and biomass, but does not lead to recruitment of species that are typical of native forests. Rates of native forest succession appear to be slow in this semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem. Current pine plantation management practices, while useful for increasing understorey biomass and plant diversity will need to be coupled with additional restoration techniques (e.g. seeding and transplants) to recover species composition and structure of native forests."	22	3	0	0	12	0	24	2015-07-02	WOS:000356007400012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

What is the relationship between flowering phenology and pollen occurring in honey sediments?Location: Mediterranean sylvo-pastoral system in Gallura, Sardinia, Italy.Methods: Phytosociological and phenological surveys were performed in a circular area of 1.5 km radius with a small apiary placed in the centre. Polleniferous and nectariferous values of plant communities were assessed based on the cover and the polleniferous and nectariferous value of each constituting species. Honey production was quantified during the main flow (March-June) and subjected to melissopalynological analysis. Data were evaluated by ordination through principal components analysis and principal coordinates analysis. The latter utilized a new index, developed for calculating the phenological distances based on the individual distributions of flowering frequencies.Results: Plant communities richest in species providing pollen and nectar were Rhamnus hedges. There was a close correlation between polleniferous and nectariferous values, suggesting that plant communities are important for honeybee foraging of both resources. The temporal flowering sequence ensured the supply of nectar and pollen throughout the spring season. Pollen foraged from 12 Trifolium species with different flowering phenology was the most abundant. Salix purpurea and Rhamnus alaternus were productive at the beginning of the season, followed by Lavandula stoechas, Echium plantagineum and E.italicum.Conclusions: Plant communities vary in importance for honeybee foraging mainly due to differences in floristic composition and flowering phenology. Communities characterized by human presence (e.g. semi-natural grasslands and hedges) are the most relevant. Some target species (e.g. Trifolium spp.) favoured by grazing livestock ensure foraging for honeybees throughout the season. Plant communities of wild areas, such as the garrigue vegetation, provide foraging for unifloral valuable honey (i.e. Lavandula' honey)."	34	3	0	0	35	0	41	2013-10-01	WOS:000324090800015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Weed species population density was surveyed in 20 0.5-m(2) plots per field four times each season from 2006 to 2010. Weed population density, species richness and diversity were analysed using repeated measures mixed models to test the effect of year, geographic location (based on plant hardiness zone) and weed management system (as described above). Weed community composition was analysed using NMDS ordination. The importance of geographic location, planted crop and weed management system were analysed using analysis of similarity and permutational ANOVA based on the Bray-Curtis similarity among sites calculated from the maximum weed species population density per site per year.Results: A total of 329 weed species were identified across the six states and all time periods. Weed communities were most strongly correlated with geographic location and secondarily to the crop planted. Weed management system affected similarity among weed communities through an interaction with site location but not every year. The weed management systems of crop rotation and GR trait rotation generally reduced weed population density and species diversity, but the effect of crop rotation varied by geographic location.Conclusions: The overall effects of weed management systems in fields including the GR trait on arable weed communities reinforce the need for locally adapted weed management programmes to steward the GR crop trait to manage for high weed diversity while reducing crop-weed competition and maximizing yield."	10	0	0	0	7	1	11	2013-11-01	WOS:000324090800014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Variability within each DIVA technique was estimated using coefficient of variation of mean percentage cover.Results: Vertical herbaceous cover estimates differed among DIVA techniques. Additionally, environmental conditions affected the vertical vegetation obstruction estimates for certain digital imagery methods, while other techniques were more adept at handling various conditions. Overall, percentage vegetation cover values differed among techniques, but the precision of four of the five techniques was consistently high.Conclusions: DIVA procedures are sufficient for measuring various heights and densities of standing herbaceous cover.

Location Eastern foothills and front ranges of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada. The area contains a diverse mix of mature and young forest, wetlands and alpine habitats. Methods We deployed six automated cameras at three locations to acquire daily photographs at the plant and forest stand scales. Plot locations were also visited on a bi-weekly basis to record the phenological stage of H.alpinum and other target plant species, as well as to collect a root sample for determination of crude protein content. Results Repeat photography and image analysis successfully detected all key phenological events (i.e. green-up, flowering, senescence). Given the relation between phenology and root nutrition, we illustrate how camera data can be used to predict the spatial and temporal distribution and quality of a key wildlife resource. Conclusions Repeat photography provides a cost-effective method for monitoring vegetation development, food availability, and nutritional quality at a forest stand scale.

The meadows had different fertilization histories: one was a species-rich hay meadow managed as a nature reserve, the other a newly created nature reserve that had been used as an agricultural pasture before. Sods collected from both locations were transferred to a glasshouse, fertilized weekly with NP, NK, PK, NPK or control solutions and harvested three times a year during two successive growing seasons.Results: Biomass production of sods from both locations of this floodplain still appeared to be limited by N.

The original indicator values from central Europe were used for the calculation of weighted community indicator values of F, N and R. These were regressed with respect to environmental data, applying standard curvilinear regression and generalized linear modelling (GLM) and new predicted values of community indicator values were obtained from the best model. Faroe species optima values of 162 taxa for one or more of the three Ellenberg scales were derived from fitting Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models of species abundance with respect to predicted community indicator values and are proposed as new Ellenberg species indicator values to be used in the Faroe Islands. F was best correlated with a GLM model containing soil moisture, organic soil fraction, soil depth and total vegetation cover, R with a GLM model containing pH and calcium in % organic soil fraction, N with total phosphorus in % organic soil fraction. The calibrated species indicator scales are much truncated, as compared with the original values, resulting in significantly different overall distributions of the original and new species indicator values. The recalculated community indicator values are much better correlated to environmental measurements. Several species do not have clear optima, but linear or monotone relationships to the examined indicator scales. This probably indicates that the occurrence of some species in the Faroe Islands are either determined by factors other than moisture, pH or soil nutrient status or, given the young age and environmental instability of the islands, are governed by stochastic mechanisms. Extension of Ellenberg indicator values outside central Europe should always be carefully calibrated by means of adequate environmental data and adequate statistical models, such as HOF models, should be applied."	47	0	0	0	36	1	49	2003-06-01	WOS:000186178600006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Although remote sensing has been used to map plant communities for several years, the maps produced are not sufficiently accurate to meet management requirements. This can be explained by the cumulative effects of floristic and spectral uncertainty. The objective of this study was to accurately map grassland plant communities using a comprehensive fuzzy approach in order to address floristic and spectral uncertainty.Location: Sub-brackish wet grasslands, Marais Poitevin, France.Methods: We first created a compromise typology-floristically and spectrally consistent-to perform fuzzy noise clustering on a joint PCA matrix derived from vegetation releves and remote sensing data. This typology had two levels, which corresponded to spectral signatures and plant communities, respectively. Second, we mapped grassland plant communities to predict the fuzzy model from the remote sensing data. We applied this approach using (1) a very high spatial resolution multispectral satellite image and a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model acquired on a 73 km(2) wet grassland site and (2) more than 200 releves collected in the field.Results: The results show that (1) the compromise typology yields significantly higher mapping accuracy than classic phytosociological typology (62% and 26%, respectively); (2) compared to a crisp approach, the fuzzy approach improves mapping accuracy by 17 percentage points and (3) a single plant community can be defined by several (1-4) distinct spectral signatures.Conclusions: The comprehensive fuzzy procedure successfully mapped herbaceous plant communities at the ecosystem scale using inexpensive remote sensing data. Floristic and spectral uncertainty was considered in a fuzzy approach, resulting in the mapping of nine herbaceous plant communities with acceptable accuracy. As the natural habitats were characterized at the plant community level, correspondence with functional properties of the species or with ecosystem services can be easily inferred. These encouraging results open up new ways to meet the requirements for monitoring the conservation status of natural habitats in the EU Habitats Directive."	18	0	0	0	10	1	23	2018-11-27	WOS:000450061000012	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Argentine Puna and High-Andean ecoregions. Methods We recorded the species composition and cover of plants in 50 vegas distributed along a ecogeographic gradient. We calculated six spatial and 14 spectral variables for each vega. We performed a correspondence analysis (CA) to explore species data and used the site's scores in a k-means analysis to identify groups of vegas. Then, we characterized each group of vegas with spatial and spectral variables with the v.test using the 'catdes' function in the FactoMineR package. Results The CA showed five groups of vegas segregated by the plant species composition. Each group was related to different spatial and spectral variables showing an ecogeographic gradient. Vegas with Poaceas were located at higher altitude and lower latitude and longitude (Group 1, Festuca nardifolia and Deschampsia hackelii). Vegas dominated by cushion species had higher humidity (Group 2, Oxychloe andina), and higher and more stable productivity (Group 3, Eleocharis pseudoalbibracteata), while vegas with halophytic species were associated with a larger area, higher salinity, and lower humidity (Group 4, Amphiscirpus nevadensis), and lower productivity (Group 5, Lycium humile and Salicornia pulvinata). Conclusions Our results are the first floristic classification and remote-sensing characterization of high-Andean vegas at a regional scale.

Here the feasibility of assessing land-use diversity and land-use change was tested at multiple scales and over time by means of statistical linear estimators based on a probabilistic sampling design.Location: The study area ( the district of Asciano, Tuscany, Italy) is characterized by erosional forms typical of Pliocene claystone (i.e. calanchi and biancane) that have been subject to the phenomenon of biancane reworking over the past 50 years, mainly owing to the expansion of intensive agriculture.Methods: Cells at two different scales (50 m x 50 m and 10 m x 10 m) were classified by two operators according to a multilevel legend, using 1954 and 2000 aerial photographs. Inter-operator agreement and accuracy were tested by Cohen's K coefficient. Total land cover estimation for each class was carried out using a multistage estimator, while the variance was estimated by means of the Wolter estimator. Field-based information on plant species composition was recorded in order to test for a relationship between land use and plant community composition by ANOVA and indicator species analysis.Results: Agreement between photointerpreters and accuracy were significantly higher than those expected by chance, proving that the approach proposed is reproducible, as long as proper quality assurance methods are used. Our data show that, at the two scales considered (50 m x 50 m and 10 m x 10 m), crops have increased against woodlands and semi-natural areas, the latter showing the highest and significantly different mean species richness. Meanwhile, an increase in the coverage of trees and shrubs was found within the semi-natural areas, probably as a result of secondary succession occurring on typical landscape elements such as biancane.Conclusions: Inferential statistics made it possible to acquire quantitative information on the abundance of land cover classes, allowing formal multi-temporal and multi-scale analysis. Sampling design-based statistical linear estimators were found to be a powerful tool for assessing landscape trends considering both time expenditure and other costs. They make it possible to maintain the same scale of analysis over time series data and to detect both coarse- and fine-grained changes in spatial patterns."	8	0	0	0	6	0	8	2009-04-09	WOS:000267484100009	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Can hydrodynamic and geomorphological features be used to predict the establishment of macrophyte communities at the shoreline scale?LocationsTwo large, shallow lakes, southwest France.MethodsBased on field observations (vegetation occurrence and anthropogenic modifications of the shore) and data generated by a geographic information system (wave exposure, wave-induced sediment re-suspension, slope and land cover), we defined sites and community groups using cluster and indicator species analyses. The groups were then analysed by means of a statistical classifier (Random Forest). These different steps in data treatment enabled us to characterize the importance of each physical factor in determining macrophyte occurrence and distribution. As a result, a predictive map to forecast aquatic plant distribution at the shoreline scale was obtained.ResultsAnthropogenic disturbances were less important parameters than natural physical variables in structuring the distribution of lakeshore macrophytes. Within natural factors, wave-induced sediment re-suspension and slope had the most impact; nevertheless, the presence of swimming areas seemed to have a strong impact on aquatic habitats, being correlated with the total absence of aquatic vegetation. The predictive map obtained through the model spatially defined the position and occurrence of suitable sites for the settlement of both invasive and rare and endangered species.ConclusionsIn this study, natural disturbances play a major role in structuring aquatic plant distribution over physical anthropogenic factors. The model contributes to improving knowledge on plant communities with respect to local hydrodynamic and morphological features of lakeshores. Furthermore, the model provides a predictive map as a useful tool for the management of aquatic vegetation in temperate shallow lakes."	17	0	0	0	14	0	24	2018-12-28	WOS:000442660900005	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We present a remote sensing based vegetation mapping technique well suited to a heterogeneous, semi-arid environment. 10 structural vegetation classes were identified and described on the ground. Using Landsat-TM from two different seasons and a combination of three conventional classification techniques (including a multi-temporal classification) we were unsuccessful in delineating all of the desired vegetation classes. We then employed a simple tex-tural classification index, known as the Moving Standard Deviation Index (MSDI), that has been used to map degradation status. MSDI measures spatial variations in the landscape and is calculated by passing a 3 x 3 standard deviation filter across the Landsat-TM red band. High MSDI values are associated with degraded or disturbed rangelands whilst low MSDI values are associated with undisturbed rangeland. A combination of two conventional multi-spectral techniques and MSDI were used to produce a final vegetation classification at an accuracy of 84 %. MSDI successfully discriminated between two contrasting vegetation types of identical spectral properties and significantly strengthened the accuracy of the classification. We recommend the use of a tex-tural index such as MSDI to supplement conventional vegetation classification techniques in heterogeneous, semi-arid or arid environments."	6	0	0	0	2	0	10	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300007	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

(3) For mapping, are LiDAR-generated canopy structure parameters or reflectance from spectral imagery more useful? (4) How can we assess uncertainty of a final map? LocationWarawara Forest, Northland, New Zealand. MethodsWe sampled 205 vegetation plots and assigned them to an existing national classification using the fuzzy classification framework of noise clustering. Plots too distinct to be assigned were used to define new associations. We produced spatial models of each association using boosted regression trees. Predictors included 11 environmental, 11 canopy reflectance, and 17 canopy structure variables. We created a composite map by assigning each map pixel to the association with the highest occurrence probability. We evaluated uncertainty by examining locations where no class was predicted with probability above 0.2 and by creating a confusion map based on entropy. ResultsForty-five plots were assigned to six of 79 existing national associations and 147 plots were used to define two new forest associations. Three shrubland types are widespread nationally, whereas two young forest types are northern. Three mature forest types are narrowly distributed nationally, with the new High-elevation hardwood forest largely restricted to Warawara Forest. Three associations were mapped using remotely sensed predictors alone, whereas two also required environmental predictors. Overall, canopy reflectance predictors explained more deviance than canopy structure. Examining locations where no association was predicted well and where multiple associations were predicted equally showed areas mapped as younger forests to have greatest uncertainty.

Location The Yellowhead Bear Management Area, a 31,180-km(2) area in west central Alberta, Canada. Methods In this paper, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as a data fusion technique to combine Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite data and Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra imagery, to quantify daily vegetation using Enhanced Vegetation Index at a 30-m resolution, for the years 2000-2018. We validated this approach, entitled DRIVE (Daily Remote Inference of VEgetation), using imagery acquired from a network of ground cameras. Results When DRIVE was compared to start and end of season dates (SOS and EOS respectively) derived from ground cameras, correlations were r = 0.73 at SOS and r = 0.85 at EOS with a mean absolute error of 7.17 days at SOS and 10.76 days at EOS. Results showed that DRIVE accurately increased spatial and temporal resolution of remote-sensing data. We demonstrated that SOS is advancing at a maximum rate of 0.78 days per year temporally over the 18-year time period for varying elevation gradients and land cover classes over the region. Conclusions With DRIVE, we demonstrate the utility of DTW in quantifying vegetation cycles over a large heterogeneous region and determining how changing climate is affecting regional vegetation. DRIVE may prove to be an important method to determine how carbon sequestration is varying within fine-scale individual plant communities in response to changing climate and likely will be beneficial to wildlife movement and habitat selection studies examining the varying response of wildlife species to changing vegetation cycles under shifting climatic conditions."	5	0	0	0	3	0	5	2019-11-27	WOS:000498839700001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Tracking recovery trajectories with satellite-based vegetation indices can strengthen predictions of restoration outcomes across broad areas with varying environmental conditions. Location Southwestern United States. Methods We quantified the recovery trajectories of spring and summer soil-adjusted total vegetation index (SATVI) for 5-10 year periods following post-wildfire seeding or prescribed burns for 241 treatment sites and related SATVI to ground-based vegetation cover. We modeled SATVI based on time since treatment, yearly temperature and precipitation, weather extremes following treatment, soil available water capacity, invasive species presence, and treatment type. We also tested for the effects of environmental variables on trajectories, by examining interactions with years post-treatment. Results Ground-based vegetation cover and SATVI were highly correlated. Most treatment sites had positive recovery rates for spring (82%) and summer (85%) SATVI. Several environmental variables affected vegetation recovery trajectories as indicated by interactions with time since treatment. Yearly warm season precipitation had a positive effect on SATVI recovery that increased over time, whereas the positive effect of extreme high warm season precipitation following treatment decreased over time for both seasons of vegetation measurements. For spring SATVI, the positive effect of cool season yearly precipitation increased over time while the negative effect of extreme high temperatures following treatment became more negative over time. Invasive species presence led to higher spring, but not summer, SATVI. Conclusions Satellite-based remote sensing is a promising tool to assess vegetation recovery following restoration treatments, particularly when it is combined with ground-based monitoring. Our results suggest that weather extremes following restoration treatments can affect vegetation recovery trajectories and may be considered in management decisions such as the timing of restoration treatments."	16	0	0	0	10	0	19	2019-03-11	WOS:000459825800009	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Under climate change, habitats suitable for alpine vegetation will progressively decrease in scale, making their protection and conservation particularly important. In the Taisetsu Mountains of Japan, alpine vegetation has changed remarkably during the last decade. The aim of this study was to estimate the distribution of habitats suitable for alpine and subalpine vegetation types (snowbeds, shrubs, and alpine heathland/fellfield) and competing vegetation types (Sasa spp. and subarctic forest), while considering uncertainties in future predictions and climate scenarios. LocationTaisetsu Mountains, Daisetsuzan National Park, Hokkaido (northern Japan). MethodsWe estimated the habitat area suitable for each vegetation type from current vegetation maps on the basis of the predictions by three global climate models (GCMs) under two climate change scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) using five habitat suitability models (HSMs) in two periods (2046-2050 and 2096-2100). We also compared the performances of the HSMs. ResultsMean summer temperature and snow-cover period had significant effects on the distribution of all vegetation types. The estimated distribution area for suitable habitat did not differ markedly among GCMs and HSMs. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, habitats suitable for snowbeds and alpine heathland/fellfield drastically decreased overall but were preserved in some regions. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, however, subarctic forest almost completely replaced alpine and subalpine vegetation types over time. ConclusionsOur projections indicate that the severity of future climate change will determine whether or not habitats suitable for alpine vegetation will remain. Monitoring the dynamics of endemic and rare species for the effects of global warming should be the priority for adaptation strategies to enable timely conservation measures."	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2022-12-28	WOS:000897843300001	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Additionally, environmental parameters (soil parameters, PAR, N-deposition) have been analysed to describe the different vegetation types.Results: By linking the vegetation types to environmental parameters, it was possible to identify N-deposition as the most important factor for the changes. In the 1960s to 1980s the replacement of vegetation types adapted to N-poor conditions by N-rich vegetation was very fast. A vegetation type containing species signifying soil impoverishment vanished totally, another vegetation type indicating nutrient poor conditions decreased dramatically. However, since 1985 up to now the decrease of N-poor vegetation types has slowed, but is still ongoing. As a reason for the decreased rate of replacement, we stressed changes in the vertical structure: From 1961 to 1985 both N-deposition as well as changes in vertical vegetation structure seem to be important. Since 1985 up to now only minor changes in vertical structure could be found; changes are mainly due to N-availability.Conclusion: In this paper, the limitations of different methods to detect vegetation changes are discussed.

Land-use types according to historical maps were digitized and georeferenced. The maps were then used for both comparing the extent of cover types in each time step and analysing the nature of change through transition matrices. The sequence of changes concerning the proportion of land-use types was then compared with classes of pollen, which were assumed to represent corresponding vegetation types. Results Most of the area (>70%) has been continuously covered with forest. In the period between 1793 and 1830, the forest declined, being the main donor to agricultural land and villages. In the 20th century, the trend was reversed. We found a significant correlation between the percentage of the main vegetation types derived from historical maps and the corresponding vegetation types, as indicated by pollen, with a mean time lag of 20yr. Conclusion The BPF landscape has been quite stable throughout the last 200yr, mainly due to the high continuity of forest cover.

Increased levels of fine-scale habitat heterogeneity that resulted from these disturbances contribute to reduced wildfire risk and increased species diversity. Disturbance-based management tools utilize disturbances in order to promote biodiversity and reduce fire risk, but are complicated to apply effectively due to the natural regeneration ability of many woody species following disturbances. Therefore, their successful application requires a better understanding of woody regeneration dynamics. Here, we asked how disturbance-based management treatments affected the spatiotemporal dynamics of woody vegetation across 11 yrs in a Mediterranean landscape.Location: Ramat HaNadiv LTER, northern Israel.Methods: We analysed vegetation dynamics in a field experiment comprising five treatments: cattle grazing, goat grazing, shrub clearing, shrub clearing followed by goat grazing and undisturbed control. We used image analysis of high-resolution aerial photographs to map woody patches in our study plots. We then quantified the spatial pattern of woody vegetation using multiple landscape indices, and conducted a comparative analysis of woody regeneration rates under different management treatments.Results: Cattle grazing did not inhibit woody regeneration, as regeneration rates were similar to those found in undisturbed control plots. Shrub clearing led to rapid woody regeneration (7% yr(-1)), while a combination of shrub clearing and intense goat grazing halted woody regeneration completely. Finally, intense goat grazing not only prevented woody regeneration but led to significant decline inwoody cover (1% yr(-1)).Conclusions: Our results highlight the rapid regenerative response of woody vegetation to severe disturbances, and the growth rates we found can serve as guidelines for long-term management regimes aimed at maintaining low woody cover and biomass in fuel breaks and buffer zones."	28	0	0	0	16	0	29	2017-01-01	WOS:000396473500012	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We tracked changes of perennial vegetation using remote sensing to address the question of how prolonged drought and land-use intensification have affected perennial vegetation cover across a desert region in the early 21st century?Location: Mojave Desert, southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona, USA.Methods: We coupled the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Enhanced Vegetation Index (MODIS-EVI) with ground-based measurements of perennial vegetation cover taken in about 2000 and about 2010. Using the difference between these years, we determined perennial vegetation changes in the early 21st century and related these shifts to climate, soil and landscape properties, and patterns of land use.Results: We found a good fit between MODIS-EVI and perennial vegetation cover (2000: R-2 = 0.83 and 2010: R-2 = 0.74). The southwestern, far southeastern and central Mojave Desert had large declines in perennial vegetation cover in the early 21st century, while the northeastern and southeastern portions of the desert had increases. These changes were explained by 10-yr precipitation anomalies, particularly in the cool season and during extreme dry or wet years. Areas heavily impacted by visitor use or wildfire lost perennial vegetation cover, and vegetation in protected areas increased to a greater degree than in unprotected areas.Conclusions: We find that we can extrapolate previously documented declines of perennial plant cover to an entire desert, and demonstrate that prolonged water shortages coupled with land-use intensification create identifiable patterns of vegetation change in dryland regions."	13	1	0	0	9	0	16	2016-10-26	WOS:000384751300007	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Using mapping, table analysis (JUICE) and ordination techniques (NMDS).Results: Table analysis using JUICE and the phi-coefficient to identify diagnostic species revealed clear groups of diagnostic plant taxa in four of the five zonal vegetation complexes. Plant communities and zonal complexes were generally well separated in the NMDS ordination. The Alaska and Canada communities were spatially separated in the ordination because of different glacial histories and location in separate floristic provinces, but there was no single controlling environmental gradient. Vegetation structure, particularly that of bryophytes and total biomass, strongly affected thermal properties of the soils. Patterned-ground complexes with the largest thermal differential between the patterned-ground features and the surrounding vegetation exhibited the clearest patterned-ground morphologies.Conclusions: Characterizing the composition and structure of small-scale plant communities growing on distinctive microhabitats within patterned-ground complexes was necessary to understand the biological and physical controls of vegetation on patterned-ground morphology. Coarser-scale vegetation units, referred to here as 'zonal patterned-ground vegetation complexes' (groups of patterned-ground plant communities within zonal landscapes), were useful for landscape and regional-level comparisons and for extrapolation of information collected at plot scales to larger regions. Vegetation maps of the representative landscapes in each subzone were needed for extrapolation. Different growth characteristics of plants growing in northern and southern parts of the gradient have an important effect in stabilizing highly frost-active soils.

Therefore, identifying areas where these forests are expected to lose or retain climatically suitable space (i.e., climate change refugia) is urgently required. Here, we modeled the current and future climatic suitability for Araucaria moist forests aiming: (a) to identify areas of suitable climate (i.e., in situ and ex situ refugia); (b) to identify areas of climate retraction; and (c) to assess the effectiveness of protected areas to capture climatically suitable space.LocationAraucaria moist forests ecoregion, southern Brazil and northeast Argentina.MethodsWe mapped the potential distribution of Araucaria moist forests using an ensemble forecasting approach with 18 indicator tree species (all wet- and cold-adapted taxa), six algorithms, eight global circulation models, three representative concentration pathways (RCPs 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5), and three periods (current, 2050, and 2070).ResultsWe predicted substantial losses of future climatic suitability across almost the entire range where these forests occur, ranging from 43% to 64% under optimistic (RCP4.5/2050) and high-emissions (RCP8.5/2070) scenarios. We found that the protected-areas network captured only 3% of the climatically suitable space under current conditions. We found that only 4% (top 1% of cells) and 12% (top 5% of cells) of the potential refugia would be protected in the future, with less than half of their areas corresponding to in situ refugia.ConclusionsProjected losses of potential distribution and the low efficacy of protected areas to buffer climate change impacts point to a high-risk scenario for Araucaria moist forests in the near future.

Together with records of water level fluctuations on the site from May 2001 to May 2004, these data were used to calculate hydrological variables for each plant community. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify groups of plant communities with similar hydrological regimes.Results: 15 plant communities were mapped at Skea loghan, with the Cirsio-Molinietum and Ranunculo-Potentilletum anserinae being the dominant phytosociological associations. Skealoghan is subject to large temporal and spatial variation in its hydrological regime and fluctuations in water level are intrinsically linked to rainfall. The spatial variation in flooding can be linked to the vegetation zones.Conclusions: GIS and DGPS technology can be used to quantify the hydrological regime of different plant communities on turloughs.

Above-ground Net Primary Production (ANPP) is the main determinant of forage availability and hence of stocking density. A tool to track the seasonal and interannual changes in ANPP at the paddock level will be very important for livestock management. We studied the relationship between field ANPP data and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for rangelands of the Flooding Pampa of Argentina using spectral data provided by sensors on board of two satellites: NOAA/AVHRR and Landsat TM. The relationship between NDVI and ANPP was linear both for data derived from NOAA/AVHRR and Landsat TM. Changes in ANPP accounted for a large proportion of the temporal and spatial variation of NDVI: 71% of NOAA/AVHRR data and 74% of Landsat TM data. By inverting these models, ANPP may be inferred from NDVI data at a seasonal and paddock scale. NOAA/AVHRR data captured better the seasonal variation in ANPP and were less sensitive to local variations than Landsat TM data. In contrast, Landsat TM data were more sensitive to inter-site differences in primary production, except for the winter months. Thus, combining information from these two sources offers a good alternative for monitoring rangeland production at high temporal and spatial resolution."	81	2	0	0	47	11	93	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300006	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Location Gebel Elba, Egypt. Methods Based on 133 vegetation plots of 100 m(2), we calculated alpha (Shannon index) and beta [the first ordination axis of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS1)] plant diversity. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to map alpha and beta diversity based on various environmental variables derived from a digital elevation model, the SoilGrids dataset, and very high resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery. The predictive models for alpha and beta diversity were mapped within the northern slopes of Gebel Elba. An ANOVA post hoc test was used to compare Shannon index and NMDS1 values among plant communities. Results The selected models revealed the importance of altitude, landforms, solar insolation, catchment area, and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index for Shannon diversity and NMDS1. The GAMs explained 54.9% of Shannon diversity and 80.6% of NMDS1. The predicted diversity maps showed that the mountainous area was more diverse and substantially different from the open desert. The post-hoc test revealed a clear separation of mountain and desert vegetation. Conclusions Employing remotely sensed variables combined with ground truth data offers great opportunities for exploring spatial patterns of biodiversity.

Location The northwest and east of the Iberian Peninsula. Methods In each study site, we defined three fire recurrence scenarios for a reference period of 35 years. We used image texture derived from the surface reflectance channels of WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 (at a spatial resolution of 2 m x 2 m and 20 m x 20 m, respectively) as predictors of post-fire vegetation cover in Random Forest regression analysies. Percentage vegetation cover was sampled in two sets of field plots with a size roughly equivalent to the spatial resolution of the imagery. The plots were distributed following a stratified design according to fire recurrence scenarios. Model transferability was assessed within each study site by applying the vegetation cover model developed for a given fire recurrence scenario to predict vegetation cover in other scenarios, iteratively. Results For both wildfires, the highest model transferability between fire recurrence scenarios was achieved for those holding the most similar vegetation community composition regarding the balance of species abundance according to their plant-regenerative traits (root mean square error [RMSE] around or lower than 15%). Model transferability performance was highly improved by fine-grained remote-sensing data.

In this paper, remote sensing- and ground-based tree population data are used to examine past and on-going changes of the tree line ecotone in a sub-arctic region characterized by precipitation increase. Questions addressed are: (1) at what rate has the tree line ecotone changed since the mid-20th century; (2) can specific temporal dynamics be identified; and (3) do combined remote sensing and tree population analyses add essential knowledge for the interpretation of tree line changes?LocationKhibiny Mountains, Kola Peninsula, northwest Russia.MethodsAerial photos from 1958, high-resolution satellite imagery from 2006/2008 and age structure data for dominant tree line species (birch and pine) were used to analyse rate of change and temporal and species-specific tree line recruitment patterns. This was accomplished using digital elevation models, resolution-merging procedures, visual interpretation and dendroecological methods.ResultsMean tree line advance for birch and pine was recorded as 29 and 27 altitudinal metres (0.6 and 0.5myr(-1)), respectively. The advance was accompanied by an apparent infilling of pre-established tree populations and by recruitment beyond the tree line. Evident increased recruitment occurred in the late 1980s for birch and in the 1970s and 1990s for pine. Establishment showed no strong correlations with climate variables, but the importance of non-growing season variables was indicated.ConclusionsThe recorded tree line advance is modest compared to global model predictions for advance at high latitudes, but in accordance with results from a number of high-latitude areas. Concomitantly, the apparent increased recruitment is indicative of a more rapidly advancing tree line zone. Studies combining remote sensing and ground-based data minimize the risk of under- or overestimating potential tree line advance. Low detectability of small seedlings and saplings by remote sensing can cause underestimation of the current potential, while ground-based data used alone can overestimate potential advance. A balance between the two approaches is beneficial and enhances quality in production of change scenarios related to high latitudinal tree line areas at local to large regional scales."	61	6	0	0	44	1	70	2014-01-01	WOS:000328544400003	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Whether spraying with pre-emergent or bio-herbicides releases native plants from competition with exotics (spray-and-release strategy) and makes communities resistant to reinvasion by exotic annual grasses (e.g. cheatgrass, medusahead), without risks to non-target native plants or secondary invasion, is a major question for land managers of semiarid plant communities. Location Sagebrush steppe of southwest Idaho, USA. Methods We applied chemical herbicides (imazapic, rimsulfuron) and weed-suppressive bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens strains MB906 and D7) to three sagebrush steppe communities after fire. We measured plant cover prior to burning and for four years (five for exotic annual grasses) post treatment. Results Both chemical herbicides significantly reduced exotic annual grass cover in all communities in the first post-spraying year, but rimsulfuron plots were re-invaded after 1-2 years, while imazapic plots continued to resist reinvasion four and even five years post spraying, well after the herbicide should have degraded. We did not detect any increase in native perennial grass cover with either herbicide, and herbicides had both positive and negative effects on individual bunchgrass basal diameter, depending on species and plant community. Rimsulfuron was more damaging than imazapic to shallow-rooted perennial bunchgrasses. Moss and lichen cover, key components of soil integrity, increased with chemical herbicide treatments in some communities. Both herbicides increased secondary invaders (exotic forbs or grasses), which varied by plant community and herbicide. Weed-suppressive bacteria treatments had no significant effects on cover of any functional group. Conclusions While short-term effects of chemical herbicides that target exotic annual grasses were relatively consistent and predictable, longer-term effects were specific to the herbicide and plant community. The spray-and-release strategy may confer resistance to re-invasion by exotic annual grasses if herbicides prevent re-invasion for an extended period."	16	0	0	0	10	0	16	2022-06-07	WOS:000801224700001	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Moreover, alternative degraded states that are hardly reversible can be observed, resulting in low-diversity communities, dominated by invasive alien species. Therefore, the need arises to understand above-ground vegetation dynamics in these communities, and the potential of the seed bank to revert this degradation. In this study, we evaluated the impact of overseeding alien legumes coupled with phosphorus fertilization on native grasslands, in terms of above-ground vegetation composition and soil seed bank. MethodsA long-term experiment (23 years) was performed in eastern Uruguay with three treatments: (1) native grasslands and native grasslands overseeded with alien legumes and fertilized at a (2) moderate or (3) high phosphorus dosage. Vegetation surveys were done in 2009 and 2019 to evaluate changes, and the seed bank was sampled in 2019. ResultsNative grasslands had higher total richness, native species richness and abundance in both years, as well as a higher species turnover in both temporal and spatial dimensions. The dominant species in overseeded treatments was the invasive alien grass Cynodon dactylon. The seed bank was similar between treatments in terms of seed density and richness, but differed in composition, with a higher abundance of alien species in the overseeded grassland. Seed banks showed low similarity with the above-ground vegetation. ConclusionsThe overseeded grassland appears to be in a degraded state of low species diversity, with low turnover and invaded by alien species. The seeds in the soil appear to be insufficient to revert this condition and might be a hindrance for restoration due to the high abundance of alien species.

Fire effects on invasive and native warm-season grass species in a North American grassland at a time of extreme drought	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	18	4	NA	NA	637	649	NA	10.1111/avsc.12171	Article	OCT 2015	2015	"QuestionCan the timing of cutting or burning be used to selectively damage an invasive C-4 grass species while limiting collateral damage to dominant native C-4 grass species in a grassland community?LocationA medium to short grass prairie in central Texas, US.MethodsWe conducted six cut and burn trials between June 2011 and January 2012 during an exceptional drought year. Target species were the native, perennial, C-4 grass Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem) and the introduced, perennial, C-4 grass Bothriochloa ischaemum (yellow bluestem). Burn trials were conducted inside a steel barrel using standardized fuel loads. To assess recovery, we counted the first cohort of new tillers that emerged after treatment and tillers that grew in the subsequent spring. We also recorded phenological status, meteorological variables and burn temperatures to determine if tiller recovery was predictable.ResultsBothriochloa ischaemum responded more negatively to burning than to cutting, but these treatments were no different for S.scoparium. Both species produced the smallest number of tillers after the summer burns, and the burn datexspecies interaction was insignificant. On average, peak fire temperature inside tussocks was 100 degrees C higher in B.ischaemum than in S.scoparium. Judging from the reduction in tiller densities in undisturbed plots from spring 2011 to spring 2012, B.ischaemum was also more sensitive to drought. Multivariate models were significant and related burn recovery to peak fire temperature, among other factors, and recovery from cutting to ambient temperature on the day of cutting. In B.ischaemum, plants with higher investment in early reproductive growth suffered more burn damage.ConclusionsWe identified no optimal burn time that maximized discrimination between the two species. Nonetheless, the invasive species was more sensitive to both drought and fire, possibly due to higher heat exposure of growing points. Thus, burning during the summer of a drought year may constitute the sought-after treatment that selectively favours native species. Ultimately, successful management will involve fuel and temperature management combined with assessment of the relative phenologies of the target species prior to burning. This study suggests that a hot fire at a time when the invasive species has a larger investment in early reproductive growth will provide the best control."	18	0	0	0	14	0	25	2015-10-01	WOS:000361181500010	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

These grasslands are changing, partly through succession after abandonment and partly owing to environmental changes. Subalpine vegetation is also affected by artificially reduced avalanche frequency. Recent conservation efforts have attempted to reverse the negative trends of change. We ask: (1) How has subalpine vegetation changed following the abandonment and avalanche control? (2) Was conservation management able to reverse the post-abandonment trend of vegetation change? (3) Did avalanche disturbance have a positive effect on plant species diversity?Location: Summit area of the HrubATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE Jesenik Mountains (1,491 m a.s.l.), Eastern Sudetes, Czech Republic.Methods: Vegetation plots sampled in the 1970s were resurveyed in the 2000s and again in 2021. Subalpine vegetation was classified into six types, and transitions between these types over time were quantified. Vascular plant species richness and the proportion of threatened species were compared between periods, between areas with and without conservation management, and between areas affected vs unaffected by a large avalanche from 2019. Species composition was analysed using principal coordinate analysis and distance-based redundancy analysis.Results: Vegetation types remained relatively stable except for species-rich grasslands, some of which changed to heathlands or tall-forb vegetation. Some competitive species have increased, and species specialized to threatened habitats declined. Conservation management systematically implemented after 2010 slowed the decline of habitat-specialized species but did not reverse it. Disturbance by an avalanche positively affected species richness but not the number of threatened species.Conclusions: Subalpine vegetation is slowly losing its plant diversity owing to grazing cessation and possibly acidification from past atmospheric deposition. Recently implemented conservation management and restoration of avalanche activity are essential to stop this trend, but future monitoring is needed to evaluate the success of management actions."	8	0	0	0	7	0	8	2023-08-21	WOS:000937128000001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

As part of biodiversity conservation efforts, grassland variation needs to be investigated at different spatial scales. We aimed to assess the landscape mosaic variation that occurred between 1988 and 2015 in the higher Mediterranean mountains. We investigated the recovery or land-degradation processes related to land use change, the effects of site condition, the impacts on grassland mosaic heterogeneity, and the threats to biodiversity. Location Sibillini Mountains (central Italy), over 1,650 m a.s.l. Methods We used two-step object-based supervised classification on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images to analyze changes in landscape patterns and vegetation cover on formerly low-intensity pastures, by assessing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index variation between 1988 and 2015. Twenty percent of the polygons obtained from segmentation were visually interpreted and assigned to five land cover classes. We generated a land use transition matrix and used Fourier Transforms to detect trends in variation of landscape mosaics and fragmentation. Results We observed prominent dynamics of the grassland mosaic leading to the homogenization of its structure through decreasing patch heterogeneity, especially on south-facing slopes. Grasslands shifted from open communities to dense pastures, with a reduction of scree and spread of tall grasses. The former trend could be understood as a recovery process reverting screes to conditions in equilibrium with local landform and climatic features, while the invasion of tall grasses is a land-degradation process that might lead to local species extinction and loss of habitat connectivity. Conclusions Pronounced changes in the large-scale landscape characteristics, mainly due to land use changes, of which scientists and managers of protected areas are not fully aware, are underway in the top mountain sectors of the study area."	19	1	0	0	8	0	22	2019-06-06	WOS:000466383400005	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What effect do restoration treatments have on invasive and native species groundcover, biomass and physiological activity, and volumetric soil water content? Location Waianae Kai Forest Reserve, Island of Oahu, Hawaii, USA. Methods The invasive grass M. maximus was suppressed by initial mowing and pre- and post-planting herbicide applications. Native species were added in three outplant and four broadcast seed treatments in a complete randomized block design. Native species and M. maximus growth and ecophysiology, and volumetric soil water content were quantified for 8 mo following treatment establishment. Results Native species outplant survival ranged from 38% to 67%. Cover of M. maximus was significantly reduced in all outplant treatments compared with control and treated control (mowing and herbicide without native species additions), but did not differ across outplant treatments. Of the native species, Dodonaea viscosa biomass was higher than Cordia subcordata, while other native species did not differ. Maximum photosynthetic rates (Amax) did not differ across species in July. However, in August (drier period), M. maximus exhibited lower Amax than all native species except T. populnea, indicating adaptive dormancy during drought. Broadcast seeding with native species was not an effective restoration treatment, as field germination ranged from 0.5% to 2.3%. Conclusions Ecological restoration of highly invaded Hawaiian tropical dry lowland ecosystems can be mediated through aggressive invasive species suppression and native species outplanting. Recommendations for restoration include initial removal of invasive grasses, adaptive suppression of grasses post-outplanting, and utilization of diverse native species assemblages that are ecophysiologically adapted to local conditions and competitive with M. maximus."	46	1	0	0	43	4	65	2013-02-14	WOS:000312159400005	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

(2) Is there a spatial correlation between nitrogen deposition and changes in vegetation? (3) What changes could be observed in the cover of lichen vegetation and the invasive bryophyte Campylopus introflexus within this period? (4) What measures can be taken to counteract the effect of spontaneous forest establishment?LocationInland dune sites across the Netherlands are primarily located in the eastern part of the country.MethodsComparative analysis of vegetation maps made in 2007 and 2018. Lichen species trends were estimated based on a study with 75 permanent plots over the period 1999-2023.ResultsOur study shows that, with increasing N deposition, the spontaneous forest establishment rate doubles. The Netherlands loses 118 ha (0.7%) of inland dune vegetation to spontaneous forest establishment annually, which is largely compensated by nature restoration measures. Increasing nitrogen deposition causes a stronger dominance of Campylopus introflexus. This resulted in a 40% decrease in the abundance of terrestrial lichen species, and consequently in a decrease in overall habitat quality.ConclusionsN deposition has a positive effect on spontaneous forest establishment in inland dune areas across the Netherlands. In total, site management would have to fell a minimum of 118 ha of Scots pine annually as a restoration measure to combat the spontaneous establishment rate and maintain the current open area inland dune habitat. Habitat quality was negatively affected and visible as a strong decline in lichen abundance and an increase in the invasive moss Campylopus introflexus."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-05-25	WOS:001492370800001	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What plant traits explain understorey vegetation response to agricultural past land use and coniferous plantation?LocationForest of Orleans (50000ha), Loiret, north-central France.MethodsCanopy cover, herb layer composition, litter and soil properties were measured in 80100m(2) plots sampled in plantations of Pinus sylvestris or P.nigra vs natural regenerations of Quercus petraea and Q.robur along a gradient of forest continuity (using historical maps and aerial photos from 1840, 1949 and 2006). We related 15 plant traits to past land use and tree species using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses.ResultsThe magnitude of past land use effect largely exceeded that of coniferous plantation. Post-agricultural forests, even 150yr after afforestation, differed from ancient forests in soil properties (thinner humus layer, higher P content, higher pH and lower C/N ratio) and plant traits. Ancient forests hosted more forest core species, stress-tolerant, competitive species and bryophytes, but fewer ruderals, annuals/biennials, shrubs and trees and nutrient-demanding species, and had lower SLA and higher LDMC. Conifer plantations had a thicker humus layer, lower pH and higher C/N ratio than deciduous forests, and hosted more light-demanding species but less forest core species. Importantly, differences in soil and plant traits between conifer plantations and naturally regenerated deciduous stands were discernible in both recent and ancient forests, indicating that tree species lastingly influence ecosystem functioning.ConclusionsPast land use and coniferous plantation resulted in different understorey plant communities and traits under pine plantations and naturally regenerated oak stands. These differences were driven through soil acidification, litter decomposition rate, light conditions, canopy development, soil disturbance, stand management and dispersal and recruitment limitations. Coniferous plantations slowed down the recovery of post-agricultural forests to ancient deciduous forest conditions. Applying natural regeneration and favouring native deciduous tree species thus helps recreate or maintain ancient forest plant communities."	25	0	0	0	25	0	29	2017-07-04	WOS:000403676000015	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

For revealing long-term changes in species composition and rank abundance PCoA ordination was applied. The relative importance of management and environmental factors in structuring vegetation were explored by CCA ordination. Diversity, evenness and the relative number and abundance of red-listed species were compared between managed and abandoned stands.Results: Our results pointed out that grasslands which were formerly grazed and dominated by S. lessingiana, in the long-term absence of grazing, have been transformed into a S. pulcherrima dominated type. Management, probably by creating bare surfaces and preventing litter accumulation, had the strongest effect on the species composition and abundance in the grasslands. Abandoned grassland stands had lower diversity and evenness compared to continuously grazed stands. While at the same time, the relative number of threatened, rare species did not differ between managed and abandoned sites.Conclusion: Maintaining extensively grazed, as well as unmanaged, Stipa dominated grasslands would be important in order to create various habitat conditions for plant species, especially threatened and rare species, and promote diversity on the landscape scale."	56	1	0	0	54	1	64	2008-02-01	WOS:000252958300007	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Other, non-standard human-mediated dispersal vectors such as clothing and motor vehicles can also transport seeds of many species, and HMD vectors often transport seeds with a variety of dispersal specialisations.Recommendations: There should be a greater movement of grazing animals throughout the landscape, either within larger grazing areas or between existing grasslands. Where this is not possible, other, more directed dispersal of propagules from species-rich communities to target sites should be considered. The potential of non-standard HMD vectors to make a positive contribution to biodiversity should be considered, but more research into all types of HMD vectors is important if we are to fully understand their role in the dispersal of plant species in fragmented landscapes."	50	1	0	0	46	0	53	2011-07-16	WOS:000292339800001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

In this 18-yr study, we investigate the effects of long-term mowing on a tallgrass prairie community invaded by exotic yellow bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum; BOIS). We explore the influence of BOIS on species richness and composition in the face of different mowing treatments as well as monitoring any post-treatment legacy effects.Location: Northeast central Oklahoma, US.Methods: A total of 144 permanent plots were laid out comprising eight treatments (i.e. all combinations of Mar, Jun and Sept, mows resulting in three single mows, three double mows, one triple mow and an un-mowed control). Plots were mowed 1996-2011 and recovery was monitored through 2014. Repeated mixed model ANOVA, PERMANOVA and principal response curves were employed to analyse species richness and compositional changes from mowing. Correlation was used to explore the effects of BOIS on species richness.Results: Mowing resulted in higher species richness relative to the absence of mowing, with the highest levels being sustained in the late season mown plots throughout the study. Once mowing had ceased, early season mown plots declined in species richness down to the same levels as the un-mown plots, concomitant with the sharpest increased cover of BOIS in these plots relative to all other treatments. Overall, we found a strong negative correlation between BOIS cover and species richness. Species dissimilarity was highest between any plot that was mowed and the un-mown controls, as well as between March and September only treatments.Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential of mowing in maintaining high species richness. However, the positive response to early season mowing of the exotic yellow bluestem and ensuing negative effect on species richness suggests that BOIS can confound the favourable effects of mowing. We found only minor post-treatment legacy effects, since BOIS strongly re-established in the absence of mowing in all previously mown plots, especially the early season mown plots. Thus, we recommend sustained late season mowing to help control the spread of BOIS and maintain species-rich grasslands."	18	1	0	0	14	0	22	2016-10-26	WOS:000384751300008	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The aim of this investigation was to study the effects of fire intensity on seed germination and seedling growth of native species which belong to three functional groups (grasses, shrubs, and fire ephemerals). We addressed the following questions: (1) How does fire intensity affect the seed germination and seedling growth of the functional groups? Are there differences among species within each functional group? (2) How do seed traits (shape, size, protection structures of seeds, and embryo position) influence the resistance to high temperatures? (3) What conclusions at the community level can we infer from our results?Location: Northwestern Patagonian grasslands, Argentina.Methods: We performed two experimental burns using different amounts of grassland biomass to simulate low and high fire intensities on sowed seeds of eight native species (four grasses, two shrubs, and two fire ephemerals). We calculated the frequency of seed germination, mean germination time, and estimated seedling growth by weighing the dry biomass (roots and leaves). We examined the relationship of seed mass, length, and shape to the percentage of seed germination in low- and high-temperature treatments.Results: Both temperature treatments negatively affected the seed germination of all functional groups and species, except for the fire ephemeral Boopis gracilis with protected linear embryos. Among grasses, the presence of protective structures in Pappostipa speciosa seeds and of hairs in Poa ianuginosa seeds probably provides resistance to high temperatures. Root growth of seedlings of the grasses Pappostipa speciosa and Festuca paliescens was stimulated by high-temperature treatment ensuring post-fire establishment.Conclusions: Our results suggest that fire intensity influences the post-fire seed germination and seedling growth of the three dominant functional groups of northwestern Patagonian grasslands. In addition, we can affirm that the species of these functional groups have adaptations to resist wildfires and are capable of exploiting post-fire resources."	4	1	0	0	3	0	5	2022-10-29	WOS:000870745000001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, little is known about the influence of the elapsed time between seeding and invasion and its interaction with other characteristics such as species composition and density, despite the fact that it could substantially help developing effective management strategies. Methods In a pot experiment, we simulated invasion by three major invasive species (Ambrosia artemisiifolia,Bothriochloa barbinodis, andCortaderia selloana) in soil covered with recipient communities differing in species composition (one, three or nine species), density (700 or 2,778 seeds/m(2)), and time advance (established one or five months previously). We assessed early invasion success by measuring seedling emergence and survival over six months. Results Early invasion success was mainly explained by recipient community's time advance and composition (or their interaction), while density had limited influence. Polycultures (three or nine species) showed generally greater invasion resistance, most likely due to high above-ground biomass essentially produced by two species. Species composition interacted with time advance in two ways: (a)Bothriochloa barbinodisseedling emergence was impacted by composition only in communities having five months of advance, suggesting that the contribution of species composition to invasion resistance varies according to the age of the community, and (b)Ambrosia artemisiifoliaandCortaderia selloanasurvival was affected by time advance in polycultures only, which produced much more biomass than monocultures, implying that a greater head start provides a competitive advantage only if it allows a sufficient increase in biomass production. Conclusions Implementing revegetation as soon as site clearance work is over, as well as establishing productive native species may help reduce invasion success. How much of an advantage recipient community time advance represents depends on biomass production."	12	0	0	0	12	0	13	2020-07-01	WOS:000543807700003	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We also determined the importance of abiotic factors such as flow regime and land use in driving these changes.ResultsComparing data from pre- and post-1990 surveys revealed that IAPs occurred mainly on lowland rivers (<200m a.s.l.), regardless of time period, and their probability of occurrence increased over time and with rising frequency of high flows. Native plant species diversity declined over time with increasing IAP cover, along lowland rivers and along all rivers that experienced extended low flows during the growing season. These conditions particularly favoured native dominant species, whereas native subordinate species responded both positively and negatively to increased flood frequency depending on survey period. Over time, Salix spp. and larger native hydrophilic species, such as Sparganium erectum, increased along lowland rivers, replacing smaller-statured ruderal species and driving a shift towards increased shade tolerance of subcanopy and groundcover species. Smaller compositional changes occurred in the uplands and these changes lacked a clear environmental signature.ConclusionsNational-scale changes in native riparian vegetation are likely driven primarily by environmental changes and land-use effects, rather than invasion by IAPs. However, IAPs, and indeed native species that benefit from abiotic changes, in turn, likely exert secondary effects on native riparian vegetation. The trend towards reduced diversity, increased shade tolerance and increased dominance of some native species and IAPs is likely linked to a set of interacting factors, including drier summers, wetter winters, increased riparian tree cover, reduced livestock access to river banks and increased fine sediment input. Determining combined effects of land use, IAPs and climate-related changes in flow regime over decadal time scales (i.e. similar to 20yr) is important for predicting ecological responses of vulnerable habitats under future disturbance scenarios."	18	0	0	0	17	0	23	2017-07-01	WOS:000403676000011	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This approach assumes: (a) baseline seed bank communities are sufficient for native plant recovery regardless of site environmental conditions; (b) different management actions variably impact native and invader seed banks; (c) management actions reduce invader seed banks; while (d) native seed banks do not decline following management; and (e) returning above-ground vegetation reflects the seed bank. Do these assumptions hold true in the context of invasive Phragmites australis management?LocationGreat Salt Lake wetlands, Utah, USA.MethodsAcross six sites, we applied six Phragmites management treatments (solarization, or glyphosate or imazapyr herbicide in the summer or fall with mowing) for three years, and monitored two more. Each year, we assessed the above-ground vegetation and seed bank using the seedling emergence method.ResultsSite environmental conditions drove baseline seed bank communities: seed banks differed substantially across sites with varying anthropogenic degradation as less disturbed sites had greater seed bank richness. Different management actions had similar impacts on native and invader seed banks. Phragmites seed density was reduced after herbicide treatments while native seed bank communities were unaffected. Above-ground vegetation generally reflected seed bank communities. However, native graminoids were present in seed banks but surprisingly rare above-ground.ConclusionCommonly held assumptions about invasive plant management and native recovery from the seed bank did not all hold true. Native seed banks were particularly insufficient for recovery at sites with greater degradation, suggesting managers should prioritize management at less degraded sites or consider revegetation in highly degraded sites. Despite reductions in Phragmites seed bank density, Phragmites propagule pressure remained high, requiring a long-term management commitment. Often seed banks are insufficient and revegetation of desired above-ground species is necessary to meet restoration goals."	15	0	0	0	15	0	17	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800015	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Understanding how SSBs develop with time can inform restoration of resilient ecosystems. Here, in fire-prone Banksia woodland restoration following sand mining, we ask: (a) how does the smoke-responsive (dormancy broken by smoke) SSB develop over time; (b) what plant-trait and climate factors influence its development; and (c) what do the data suggest for the resilience of these restored woodlands to fire?Location: Ellenbrook, Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia (latitude -31.76, longitude 115.95).Methods: We used smoke, a key germination cue associated with fire disturbance, to trigger germination of the SSB in Banksia woodland restoration. Using a chronosequence of nine ages between 3 and 26 years since initiation of restoration, we tested how the SSB develops using counts and richness of germinating native and invasive annuals, and native perennial obligate seeding and resprouting species. To understand the contribution of above-ground restored vegetation to SSB development, we compared Sorensen's similarity of the smoke germinable SSB (smoked SSB) and untreated germinable SSB (control SSB) with above-ground vegetation.Results: Smoked SSB germinant density decreased with restoration age for both native and invasive annuals, but was stable for native perennials. Similarity between smoked SSB and above-ground vegetation was higher for perennial obligate seeders than for resprouters and peaked for perennials at 23 years.Conclusions: Post-fire regeneration potential of the SSB was evident across the chronosequence, with restoration age influencing the density of native annuals and overall composition of the SSB. The findings for perennial species suggest an increase in resilience to fire with restoration age."	7	0	0	0	2	0	7	2023-08-21	WOS:000945113100001	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Why is a community-level approach important in understanding invasion? Do native and non-native plant species differ in their successional trajectories within communities?Location: Northeastern United States, in the Piedmont region of New Jersey. Previously farmed since the 1700s, ten fields were experimentally retired from agriculture beginning in 1958.Methods: Fifty years of permanent plot data were used to quantify the Population demographics of the 84 most abundant species during succession. These measures were then used to compare native, non-native and non-native invasive species' Population dynamics in succession.Results: Once basic life-history characteristics were accounted for, there were no differences in the Population dynamics of native, non-native, and non-native invasive plant species. However, the species pool in this study was biased towards ruderal species, which largely constrained non-native species to early Succession.Conclusion: Successional systems are crucial to our understanding of invasions as they constrain all species to the role of colonizer. By focusing on the whole community, rather than on individual problematic species, we found no systematic differences between native and non-native species. Thus, knowing simple life-history information about a species would be much more useful in setting management priorities than where the species originated."	18	0	0	0	15	0	20	2009-02-01	WOS:000265846400006	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A repeated measures design was used, with floristic data recorded in permanent plots in the post-fire successions (n = 12) over a 7-year period. The data were analysed using multivariate ordination techniques (PCA, RDA and PRC) and mixed effects models.Results: The age of Calluna stands strongly influenced post-fire succession, different trends due to age explained 10.4% of variation in floristic data. Young heath showed faster succession towards pre-fire community composition than old heath, and this could partially be explained by succession-related factors: young heath had lower cover of mosses and lichens in the pre-burned vegetation, and lower cover of litter early in succession. Young heath had a less pronounced overall community response to fire than old heath. Vegetative regeneration of C. vulgaris was absent in both old and young heath, but Calluna still re-established as the dominant species within 5-7 years in both young and old stands. Regeneration dynamics were also affected by habitat conditions, different trends due to habitat explained 6% of variation.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that old stands do develop characteristic heathland vegetation and structure after fire, and while potential invasives into the system such as trees and rhizomatous species are present, they do not impair Calluna regeneration or vegetation development towards the target heathland community composition and structure. Further, as our young stands are only in their second fire rotation after restoration, we suggest that characteristic dynamics of managed heathlands can re-establish relatively rapidly, even in severely degenerated sites (450 years since last fire). Site-specific factors also need to be considered. We conclude that there is restoration potential in old heaths, despite slow dynamics in the first rotation."	24	0	0	0	13	0	26	2012-02-16	WOS:000299207600012	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The vegetation was sampled at different elevations of a sand dune which became partly invaded by the tree Robinia pseudo-acacia ca. 10 yr ago. Pre-abandonment vegetation records were used as historic references. Though composition of the non-invaded grassland only changed moderately, dominance of tall grasses (Elymus hispidus, Poa angustifolia) increased significantly at the cost of annuals and low stature perennials. In the stand invaded by Robinia most grassland species were lost and replaced by nitrophytes. Vertical position influenced species abundance, but affected the composition only moderately. Fine-scale zonation of the vegetation also changed with time. Species richness of the above-ground vegetation and the seed density of soil samples at the lower elevation were slightly greater than at the higher sites.Seed banks of sensitive grassland specialists (e.g. Pulsatilla pratensis subsp. hungarica) disappeared during grass encroachment. Following extinction from above-ground vegetation, restoration must rely on dispersal from adjacent areas. In contrast, several annuals and perennials, which survived this degradation stage in the above-ground vegetation, possessed seed banks. Many of these species became extinct from the vegetation during the Robinia invasion but left viable persistent seeds. This fact is promising for restoration of the Potentillo-Festucetum sandy pasture. Competitive weedy species and sprouting Robinia can, however, limit seedling establishment."	52	0	0	0	53	1	64	2003-12-01	WOS:000220133300009	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We tested the hypotheses that: (1) seed burial only favours the emergence of round seeds; and (2) straw mulching improves soil moisture and prevents the emergence of the invasive grass Urochloa decumbens, promoting the establishment of native tree seedlings.LocationExperimental field, Central Brazil. Savanna, recently dominated by exotic pasture.MethodsWe evaluated the effects of seed burial (surface and buried) and mulching (no-mulch, 5-cm straw mulch and 10-cm straw mulch) on the emergence, survival and growth of 16 species of native Cerrado tree species with variable seed sizes and shapes and seedling types. Thirty seeds of each species were sown per treatment combination in three blocks.ResultsSeed burial did not affect the emergence of species with round seeds, but negatively affected species with flat seeds and phanerocotylar-epigeal-foliaceous seedlings. Straw mulching reduced the emergence of flat seeds and phanerocotylar seedlings, but increased soil moisture and strongly reduced U.decumbens emergence, resulting in a higher growth rate of tree seedlings up to 1yr for five species.ConclusionDirect seeding is an effective technique to plant a mixture of Cerrado tree species for restoration, provided the soil is well prepared and there are mechanisms to control invasive species."	33	2	0	0	24	4	40	2017-07-01	WOS:000403676000010	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is above-ground vegetation correlated to the viable soil seed bank immediately following soil disturbance from restoration thinning treatments?Location: Northern Arizona, USA.Methods: Soil seed bank samples were taken along replicated transects and collected with a 5-cm diameter bulk density hammer. Samples included a 5-cm diameter O-horizon sample (at varying depths) plus the underlying mineral soil to a depth of 5 c m. The seedling emergent method was used to quantify seed bank species composition and density. The herbaceous and shrub plant community was quantified along the same transects using the point intercept method.Results: Early-successional or ruderal species were common in the soil seed bank at all three disturbance sites. Non-native species, notably Verbascum thapsus, were more numerous (up to 940 seeds/m(2)) under high disturbance with overgrazing and logging, and less common or absent under low disturbance. Most viable seeds were found in the O-horizon and the upper 5 cm of mineral soil; there was little correlation between species in the soil seed bank and the above-ground vegetation.Conclusions: We recommend that restoration plans be geared toward minimizing activities, such as severe soil disturbance, that may promote the spread of non-native invasive species, and that manual seeding be explored as an option to restore plant species diversity and abundance."	35	4	0	0	32	2	48	2005-05-01	WOS:000232547000013	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This study investigated the relationship between multispectral remote-sensing data from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 and species richness and diversity in mountainous and protected grasslands. LocationsGolden Gate Highlands National Park, Free State, South Africa. Methods: In-situ data of plant species composition and cover from 142 plots with 16 relev & eacute;s each were distributed across the study site and used to calculate species richness and Shannon-Wiener species diversity index (species diversity). We used a machine-learning random forest algorithm to optimize the prediction of species richness and diversity. The algorithm was used to identify the optimal spectral bands and vegetation indices for estimating species richness and diversity. Subsequently, the selected bands and vegetation indices were used to estimate species richness through random forest regression. Results: This research found weak relationships between remote-sensing vegetation indices and the diversity metrics, but significant relationships were found between some spectral bands and diversity metrics. Moreover, using machine-learning random forest, the multispectral data sets exhibited strong predictive powers. In this investigation, near-infrared (NIR) seemed to be the most selected band for both sensors to explain species diversity in mountainous grasslands. Main conclusions: This finding further ascertains the efficiency of optimizing high spatial resolution spectral information to estimate plant species richness and diversity. This research shows that NIR, Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) are the most adequate for predicting species richness and diversity in mountainous grasslands with relatively good accuracies.

(Chinese privet), affect tree growth rates in forested riverine wetlands?Location: Three sites along the Wolf River, in and near Memphis, Tennessee, USA.Methods: We cored and analysed 83 oak trees within three study sites. Correlations of river channelization and climatic variables with basal area increments (BAI) and detrended BAI (SFS) were analysed to investigate channelization effects. Significant correlations were removed from BAI chronologies (BAI-HR) to isolate the effect of L. sinense. We investigated effects of L. sinense on tree growth using a before-after/control-impact (BACI) experimental design with one location impacted by invasion (INV), two control locations that were not invaded (NON and REF) and covariates of tree age and size. We conducted a two-factor mixed effects ANCOVA to determine if there was a significant interaction (BACI) effect.Results: Channelization promoted faster canopy oak growth in all sites, spring drought significantly slowed growth in NON, while summer precipitation promoted wood production in NON. Investigation of L. sinense impact on tree growth revealed a significant BACI effect, such that trees in INV grew slower after invasion than trees in the non-invaded control sites (NON and REF).Conclusions: We suggest that faster growth after channelization may be a consequence of increased aerobic conditions, by enabling higher oxygen availability to tree roots. However, many of the obligate bottomland tree species struggle to regenerate in drier, post-channelized conditions. Thus, native drought-tolerant species may have an advantage in the sub-canopy and regeneration layers of these altered forests. Instead, L. sinense, an invasive and drought-tolerant species, has invaded most locations adjacent to the channelized portion of the Wolf River. L. sinense presence reduces the channelization advantage by slowing growth of canopy oaks and possibly contributing to accelerated mortality. These results suggest an emerging shift to a commonly held paradigm with respect to invasive shrub species. Not only do invasive shrubs crowd out other small woody species and herbaceous plants, but they also have the ability to impact the structure of the forest canopy."	8	0	0	0	7	0	11	2016-10-26	WOS:000384751300005	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We asked: how did vegetation succession in the low and high marsh respond to this change in management from a large-scale and long-term perspective, and what were the major drivers of successional change?Location: Wadden Sea coast, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.Methods: We used vegetation data from the Trilateral Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP) for around half of the Wadden Sea mainland salt marshes to identify main successional pathways of the TMAP vegetation types Puccinellia maritima and Festuca rubra, dominating low and high marsh areas, respectively, prior to the change in management. Drivers of succession were analysed using classification and regression tree models, a non-parametric vegetation modelling technique.Results: Since the abandonment of grazing and drainage, progressive succession towards the TMAP vegetation types Atriplex portulacoides and Elymus athericus strongly increased and mostly occurred in abandoned areas at medium to high elevation. Retarded and retrogressive succession decreased and mostly occurred in grazed and low-lying areas. Persistance of the early successional vegetation type Puccinellia maritima in the salt marshes of the northern Wadden Sea suggests that large-scale gradients of salinity, inundation frequency and sedimentation lead to geographical variation in the pace of succession.Conlusions: Considered from a large-scale and long-term perspective, abandonmnent of grazing and drainage caused spread of grazing-sensitive plant species from mid- and late-successional stages. This change in vegetation composition affects species diversity and ecosystem functions of the Wadden Sea mainland salt marshes. Grazing regime and elevation were found to be the most important drivers of succession. To achieve and maintain large-scale heterogeneity in vegetation composition, we recommend management to maintain a mosaic of grazed and ungrazed areas, and to consider the role of large-scale gradients of environmental factors driving succession."	23	0	0	0	22	0	26	2014-12-31	WOS:000345761800010	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Cover was assessed overa 12-year period from 1990. Pellet-group clearance counts provided data on sheep usage between 1990 and 1996. Snow-lie was mapped in the springs of 1991-1996.Results: The snow-fence created a gradient in sheep use and altered the duration of snow-lie. At the start of monitoring Racomitrium cover was lower immediately adjacent to the fence, and after 12 years its cover was significantly reduced within 10 in of the fence. Further away from the fence Racomitrium cover was relatively stable. The loss of Racomitrium was correlated both with increased snow-lie and heavier sheep usage. Grass cover increased near the fence and was related to sheep use. Dicranum fuscescens responded differently to Racomitrium, increasing significantly near the fence.Conclusions: We found that changes in snow-lie and grazing pressure quickly brought about vegetation change in this montane ecosystem. Racomitritum was the most sensitive species to the changes in grazing and snow-lie caused by the fence, having the biggest initial changes.

Our goal was to develop a tool for assigning vegetation-plot records to the habitats of the EUNIS system, use it to classify a European vegetation-plot database, and compile statistically-derived characteristic species combinations and distribution maps for these habitats. Location Europe. Methods We developed the classification expert system EUNIS-ESy, which contains definitions of individual EUNIS habitats based on their species composition and geographic location. Each habitat was formally defined as a formula in a computer language combining algebraic and set-theoretic concepts with formal logical operators. We applied this expert system to classify 1,261,373 vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA) and other databases. Then we determined diagnostic, constant and dominant species for each habitat by calculating species-to-habitat fidelity and constancy (occurrence frequency) in the classified data set. Finally, we mapped the plot locations for each habitat. Results Formal definitions were developed for 199 habitats at Level 3 of the EUNIS hierarchy, including 25 coastal, 18 wetland, 55 grassland, 43 shrubland, 46 forest and 12 man-made habitats. The expert system classified 1,125,121 vegetation plots to these habitat groups and 73,188 to other habitats, while 63,064 plots remained unclassified or were classified to more than one habitat. Data on each habitat were summarized in factsheets containing habitat description, distribution map, corresponding syntaxa and characteristic species combination. Conclusions EUNIS habitats were characterized for the first time in terms of their species composition and distribution, based on a classification of a European database of vegetation plots using the newly developed electronic expert system EUNIS-ESy. The data provided and the expert system have considerable potential for future use in European nature conservation planning, monitoring and assessment."	287	4	0	0	245	1	333	2020-08-16	WOS:000560187300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do SOMs provide robust alternatives to traditional classification methods, particularly when underlying species response functions are unknown or difficult to approximate, or when a need exists to continuously classify new samples obtained under ongoing long-term ecosystem monitoring programs as they become available? Location Coastal Louisiana, USA. Methods A SOM was trained from in-situ observations of 559 vegetation species relative cover data from 2,526 samples collected over 8 years at 343 locations across coastal Louisiana. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the SOM output to delineate vegetation community types, and indicator species analysis was conducted. Salinity and flood duration were compared across the delineated community types. Results The SOM patterned the 2,526 training samples into 260 output neurons, which were further clustered into eleven community types. Clear gradients in salinity and flood duration existed among the community types, and geographic zonation of the communities was evident across the landscape. At some locations assemblages were temporally stable; at other locations, they varied considerably. Samples not used in training the network were effectively projected onto the SOM and assigned to one of the delineated community types. Conclusions The SOM was effective in delineating plant communities in the region that were qualitatively similar to those obtained in previous investigations. Being robust to skewed distributions and the presence of outliers, SOMs provide an alternative to traditional distribution-based statistical approaches. Their ability to efficiently classify new data into existing community types makes their use an ideal approach to classifying samples obtained from ongoing, long-term ecological monitoring programs."	9	2	0	0	4	0	13	2019-06-06	WOS:000466383400003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

LocationUkrainian Crystalline Shield, Steppe and Forest-Steppe zones, Ukraine. MethodsThe field research was performed during 2013-2020. Analysis was done with the JUICE software using agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis in the integrated PC-Ord with data transformation, pseudospecies cut levels 0-5-25, distance measure - Jaccard, group linkage - Ward's method. For the ordination of the plots we used detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with the envfit function, implemented in the R package vegan. As environmental variables we used mean indicator values obtained for each species from the ITALIC database. A generalized synoptic table, which combined both our own and literature data, was clustered using Euclidean distances and the Ward error sum of squares hierarchical clustering method with Ward's criterion. ResultsSeven clusters were obtained after JUICE analysis based on 197 releves of lichen communities that included 119 lichen species. The main axis in both DCA and NMDS ordination is similar to the vector of substrate pH value. Communities on overhanging surfaces are acidophilous. Communities of water tracks are moderately basophilous to basophilous. Other communities included releves on different granite characterized as mainly neutrophilous. Lichen communities on siliceous rocks of the Ukrainian Crystalline Shield are assigned to the classes Rhizocarpetea geographici, Leprarietea chlorinae, and Collematetea cristati. Two new alliances (Aspicilion intermutantis and Staurothelion frustulentae), four new associations and three subassociation are described. ConclusionSilicicolous lichen communities of the Ukrainian Crystalline Shield differ from the known units of Central Europe by species composition, where lichens with arid ecology are present. Their local distribution depends mainly on a combination of substrate pH, degree of eutrophication, protection from rain, and substrate moisture."	4	0	0	0	3	0	5	2023-01-11	WOS:000903529100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In these approaches, all species are regarded as biologically equidistant regardless of the biological heterogeneity. The objective of the study is to evaluate the potential of the Discriminating Avalanche approach, which integrates species abundance and biological heterogeneity, as a new basis for forest classification.Location China, India, Iran, Ukraine, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Peru, and South Africa.Method We illustrate our approach using a set of 35 large tree-mapped forest plots from various regions of the world. Our dissimilarity matrices, which integrate species abundance with biological heterogeneity, are compared with the standard Bray-Curtis and Whittaker dissimilarity indices, and provide the quantitative basis for a hierarchical cluster analysis.Results Four distinct groups of forests were identified using the proposed forest dissimilarity matrix. Afro-montane forests from South Africa constitute a first group. A second group includes temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests dominated by oak (Quercus) and beech (Fagus) from Europe and China. Conifer-dominated forests constitute a third group. The remaining forests constitute the fourth group.Conclusion Biological heterogeneity provides a practical basis for vegetation classification. The results of this study, based on a variety of temperate and tropical forests, suggest that a measure of biological dissimilarity based on evolutionary and morphological differences among species is more effective than the traditional species abundance-based approaches to classify an arbitrary set of plant communities. This approach promises greater refinement and consistency in ecological classification. In particular, it has advantage in classifying forests along large geographic scales in situations of high beta diversity and species turnover."	7	1	0	0	7	0	8	2021-04-25	WOS:000636291500012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location The southern margin of the Pannonian plain (N and E Slovenia, N Croatia, N Serbia). Methods A database of 2,575 vegetation plots originally assigned to theMolinio-Arrhenathereteawas compiled. Semi-supervised classification based on theK-means algorithm was applied to assign plots into 12 a-priori alliances and to search for new alliances. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination with Ellenberg's indicator values and bioclimatic variables were applied to show the influence of ecological conditions on species composition. The plots within each alliance were further classified into associations using the beta flexible method. Results Classification resulted in 12 alliances recognized in the EuroVegChecklist, and two new groups appeared. The first group occurs in the eastern part of the research area, where many ruderal species appear. This group was treated as a new alliance,Salvio nemorosae-Arrhenatherionforming a vicariant syntaxon of the allianceArrhenatherion. The second group occurs in the western part. It is a transitional group between mesic (Arrhenatherion) and wet meadows (Deschampsion) and can be treated asAlopecurion. Besides, three new associations and six new subassociations were described, together with the typification of seven associations and of three subassociations. Numerical analyses revealed floristic, ecological and geographical differentiation among analysed vegetation types. Conclusions The communities showed typical Central European features in the western part, but their floristic and ecological conditions changed towards the eastern part, where the continental influence was more pronounced. The vegetation structure and plant species composition in the studied area were influenced by soil moisture and soil nutrient availability as well as by strong biogeographical and climatic gradients."	10	1	0	0	6	0	11	2020-08-20	WOS:000557277300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The releves were classified into vegetation types using the hierarchical ISOPAM method. Forest and shrubland types were described on the basis of diagnostic species occurrences and their distribution in relation to environmental factors. A map of the actual vegetation derived from remote-sensed images (Landsat) and field data was used to describe the current distribution and abundance of the different vegetation types.Results: The classification of the 351 plots x 837 species matrix revealed two major clusters comprising seven woody vegetation types corresponding to Chaco lowland and mountain forests and shrublands, Espinal forests and edaphic vegetation. The most important gradients in woody vegetation types are related to elevation, temperature and rainfall variables.Conclusions: Subtropical seasonally dry woody plant communities from the southern extreme of the Great Chaco and Espinal forests were described for the first time based on complete floristic data. Our results show that lowland Chaco native forests, as well as replacement communities, are still present in its southern distribution range and are well distinguishable from other vegetation types such as the Espinal and mountain forests. Overall, extensive Espinal forests have almost disappeared while Chaco vegetation is highly fragmented and degraded."	116	1	0	0	99	10	133	2018-05-08	WOS:000430912500014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How do the woody plant communities we describe, based on representative sampling, compare to those of previous New Zealand classifications?Methods: We used cluster analysis to classify data from 1177 systematically located vegetation plots, calculated spatial extent and ecological statistics for each alliance defined, and combined forest alliances into groups to assess correspondence with earlier mapped classifications. We used plot-based data on vegetation structure to infer potential community changes.Results: Twenty-four alliances were recognized, each of 19 to 105 plots, with estimated extents of 144 000-794 000 ha. Stand structure data suggest that 15 alliances are largely stable whereas nine may undergo compositional change. Among alliances, the proportion of exotic species ranged from 0 to 50%. Our forest and shrubland classification is another stage in progressively revising such classifications (i.e. forest class maps, vegetative cover map, ECOSAT woody classification and land cover database) produced over the last five decades.Conclusions: Compared to the previous classifications, our new classification incorporates alliances in disturbed landscapes, as well as those that are compositionally dynamic and which are also invaded by exotic species. It also provides greater partitioning within Nothofagus forests, but fails to distinguish some rare forest types, such as those dominated by Agathis australis.

Hedges (the woody, structural element) and hedge-bottoms (the mainly herbaceous ground flora) were analysed separately because different natural and management processes were expected to affect them.The 11 hedge classes varied in size from five to over 500 plots. Over two-thirds of all hedges were dominated by Crataegus spp. or Prunus spinosa. Hedge-bottoms were more evenly grouped into four classes whose species composition could be related to broad land use/habitat types: intensive arable, rotational/mixed farming, managed grasslands, and woodland. The woodland class was only 12% of the total, and species characteristic of true woodland habitats were uncommon even within that class, so our data do not support the hypothesis of hedgerows acting as 'woodland corridors' for plants.Richness/diversity scores differed markedly between different hedge and hedge-bottorn classes. The richest hedgerows, both in species and inferred habitats, were among the rarer types, while the most common classes (both hedge and hedge-bottorn) were consistently the poorest.Comparison of species composition and diversity in hedges and hedge-bottoms, and associations between them, all supported the hypothesis that the relative importance of historical, management and ecological effects differed between the two parts of the hedgerow; hedges and hedge-bottoms should be treated ecologically as largely independent units.The classifications and richness/diversity scores enable easy preliminary assessment of the conservation value of a hedgerow.

Here we present an efficient algorithm implementing the vegetation classification expert system in the statistical programming language R.Methods The principal idea of the R implementation is to solve the assignments to vegetation types not sequentially plot by plot but to parse the assignment rules into (nested) components that each can be evaluated by simultaneous vector-based processing of all plots in a database.Results and conclusions We demonstrate the algorithm taking the EUNIS classification expert system of European habitat types (EUNIS-ESy) as an example. The R code version of the vegetation classification expert system is particularly useful in large vegetation-plot databases because it solves all logical operations vector-wise across all plots, allowing for efficient evaluation of membership expressions and formulas. Another advantage of the R implementation is that membership formulas are not only readable but can also be produced as a machine-written result, for example as the output of classification algorithms run in R."	19	2	0	0	17	0	21	2021-04-25	WOS:000636291500003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Methods We used a dataset of 728 releves, which were resampled to reduce unbalanced sampling effort, resulting in a dataset of 568 releves and 846 taxa. We classified the plots by TWINSPAN, interpreted the resulting pools, and used them to develop formal definitions of phytosociological alliances characterised by L. spartum vegetation. The definitions were included in an expert system to assist automatic vegetation classification. We related the alliances to climatic factors and described their biogeographical features and ecological preferences.

We investigated whether it is possible to propose an optimal period during the year for making relevant releves of emergent wetland vegetation. Location Marshlands of the central Balkan Peninsula. Methods One hundred and eighty-five permanent vegetation plots were investigated in three distinct time periods: spring, summer and autumn. In order to identify the communities, cluster analyses were carried out, and diagnostic species for each cluster were determined. The potential for temporal change of the communities regarding the species and life form composition was assessed using PERMANOVA and NMDS analyses. The Friedman test was used to assess the significance of seasonal change in the communities regarding their species richness, recordability and Shannon diversity. Results The level of floristic similarity among the 11 phytocoenoses analyzed significantly varied over the growing season while the composition in terms of their diagnostic species remained unchanged. The majority of the communities showed statistically significant seasonal changes in the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the vegetation, life form composition and cover. Although different communities expressed significant modifications in these parameters between different pairs of seasons, all of them showed changes in the mentioned parameters between spring and autumn. The degree of intra-annual variation in the species richness, species recordability and Shannon diversity was low in almost all phytocoenoses. Conclusions Summer is the optimal period for recording most of the species from the total list of the communities developed on hydrologically stable habitats, while spring is more appropriate for making releves on periodically inundated habitats. The sampling time has negligible impact on the classification of associations but it could have important implications for the classification of higher-ranked syntaxonomic units of the class Phragmito-Magnocaricetea."	4	0	0	0	4	0	4	2019-06-06	WOS:000466383400002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Using the hierarchical ISOPAM method, the releves were classified into main forest types and their species composition, diversity and distribution were described. Their differentiation along main environmental gradients was analysed with classification and regression trees.Results: Eleven vegetation types of forests were distinguished and assigned to five vegetation classes: Quercetea mongolicae (representing the core of the Korean temperate forests), Vaccinio-Piceetea (subalpine coniferous forest), Fagetea crenatae (rare beech-dominated forest included within a sub-montane and sub-oceanic type of oak-dominated forest), Querco mongolicae-Betuletea davuricae (sub-continental drought- and fire-tolerant forest, differentiated along elevational gradient) and Camellietea japonicae (oceanic evergreen forest). At a higher hierarchical level, these 11 vegetation types were grouped into three clusters, which most probably reflect different vegetation development in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Within the three major vegetation clusters, each forest type occupies a distinct environment. The forest types are especially well separated along elevational and temperature gradients. The distribution of individual forest types is joinly driven by total amount of incoming energy and thermal extremes, both affecting water supply to plant communities.Conclusions: All distinguished vegetation types can be assigned to the recent syntaxonomic classification system. However, three main vegetation clusters do not correspond to traditionally distinguished syntaxonomic units. Nevertheless, the forest types within these clusters share common species with similar ecology and, especially, migration histories during the late glacial and post-glacial periods. Therefore, we interpret these clusters as biogeographic patterns reflecting vegetation history rather than the current environmental conditions."	30	0	0	0	26	1	35	2014-12-31	WOS:000345761800003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

These constitute the world's largest alpine biome, but their vegetation is virtually unknown. Due to their vast extent, they are relevant for functioning of large-scale climatic systems. In turn, arid and alpine biomes are suspected to be highly sensitive to ongoing climate change, underwent climate-driven changes during the Last Glacial Maximum and have been subject to overgrazing and desertification.Location: Northwestern Tibetan highlands (China: Xizang, Qinghai), 4200 to 5400 m a.s.l., total area ca. 800 000 km(2).Methods: Two hundred and fifty-three vegetation records with absolute percentage cover were classified based on expert knowledge and analysed by DCA; composition of plant functional types related to grazing resilience was also assessed.Results: Ten communities of alpine steppe were distinguished. A set of 11 alpine steppe species is distributed throughout the highlands, with a precipitation gradient between 350 mm yr(-1) (southeast) and 20 to 50 mm yr(-1) (northwest). The elevational range of more than 80% of species is larger than 1000 m. The data set comprises 30% endemic species, with ten endemic genera.Conclusions: The wide thermal and hygric range of many species and high rate of endemism do not support the idea of high sensitivity to climate change or occurrence of past climate-driven extinctions. The prevailing plant functional types are grazing resilient, and evidence for overgrazing is very limited. Cushion plants and dwarf shrubs, however, become increasingly rare around settlements, because they are uprooted for fuel. Hence, the world's largest arid alpine biome is apparently resilient to climatic changes and grazing. This contradicts common perceptions about arid and alpine ecosystems and therefore deserves intense multi-disciplinary research efforts."	61	7	0	0	48	0	68	2011-09-21	WOS:000294600100008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We address the question whether there is a transitional semi-evergreen bushland on the eastern escarpment of the Ethiopian Highlands, with unique floristic characteristics that distinguish it from the evergreen bushlands in other parts of Ethiopia and eastern Africa.Methods: Based on a review of the recent descriptions of evergreen bushlands in Ethiopia, we hypothesize that there is a distinct zone of natural semi-evergreen bushland, which is restricted to the eastern and southeastern escarpment of the Ethiopian Highlands. In contrast, evergreen bushlands in other parts of Ethiopia are considered to be of a secondary nature. To test this hypothesis, we carried out qualitative vegetation surveys in 354 locations across Ethiopia and classified the vegetation in these locations based on the occurrences of indicator species. Based on this data, we created predictive distribution models of the semi-evergreen bushland in Ethiopia using various environmental distribution models. We furthermore compared the occurrences of characteristic evergreen bushland species in Ethiopia with the occurrence of these species within the evergreen bushlands in Kenya and Uganda.Results: The vegetation surveys confirmed the existence of a distinct type of evergreen bushland vegetation. The transitional semi-evergreen bushland forms a transitional zone between the Acacia-Commiphora woodland and bushland and the Afromontane forest on the eastern and southeastern escarpments of Ethiopia, but is also characterized by a number of species that, within Ethiopia, are unique to this zone. Most of the characteristic species of the transitional semi-evergreen bushland are not found or only in lower densities in western Ethiopia. There is, furthermore, a limited overlap in characteristic species of the evergreen bushlands of Kenya and Uganda.Conclusions: Our results provide important information on the hitherto inadequately studied semi-evergreen bushland of Ethiopia. It highlights the unique character of this part of the evergreen bushlands in Ethiopia, which we argue should be taken into account for future conservation planning."	12	1	0	0	11	1	16	2016-06-01	WOS:000374545600017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Correlations between DCA releve scores and explanatory variables (EIV, portion of life forms and chorotypes, altitude, latitude and longitude) were subsequently calculated. Results Cluster analysis divided mesophilous beech forests of SE Europe into two major clusters. Beech forests can therefore be classified into two alliances, Aremonio-Fagion and Fagion moesiacae. Further division revealed seven beech and beechfir forest types, which we interpreted geographically and ecologically. A significant increase in the proportion of chamaephytes, hemicryptophytes and therophytes was detected along the main macroecological gradient towards the S and E. At the same time, the proportion of geophytes and phanerophytes significantly decreased in the same direction. There was also a significant increase in the proportion of Stenomediterranean, Eurymediterranean, Mediterranean-Montane, and Eurasian species, while Boreal species, as expected, decreased toward the southeast. The main differentiation of beech forests in SE Europe is due to macroecological factors (macro-climatic and historical development of vegetation), whereas local ecological factors (particularly temperature and moisture) are reflected in the differentiation of sub-alliances. Conclusions Our study confirmed two major groups of beech forests in the research area, which could be classified into two alliances. It also revealed that there is not just an altitudinal distribution of beech forests in the SE part of the research area, but also structural and functional changes of communities as a result of the altitudinal limitation of beech forests and changed macroclimatic factors."	35	2	0	0	27	0	42	2013-01-01	WOS:000312159400014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How does the structure of field boundaries determine the composition of vegetation?Location: Estonia, six 4 kin x 4 kin agricultural areas.Methods: We studied the vegetation of fields and field boundaries using 2 m x 2 m sample plots. We estimated the frequency of species in both habitat types, applied an MRPP test to analyse the vegetation composition of field boundaries with various combinations of landscape features (ditches, roads, tree and bush layers) illustrating this by DCA ordination, and used indicator species analysis to determine the characteristic species of each boundary type.Results: Ca. 45% of the flora of field boundaries comprised species found on agricultural land. Most typical species in fields - agrotolerants - were also the most common in field boundaries. The vegetation of road verges and grassy boundaries consisted mainly of disturbance-tolerant species. Woody boundaries were characterised by shade-tolerant and nitrophilous species. Ditch banks included species typical of moist habitats and semi-natural grasslands. Few threatened or protected species were observed.Conclusions: The vegetation composition of field boundaries varied due to the complex effects of landscape structure around and in these boundaries. Plant species in agricultural landscapes can be classified into two broad emergent groups on the basis of their different responses to agricultural disturbances-agrotolerant species and nature-value species. Agrotolerant species are promoted by agriculture, nature-value species include rare weeds and habitat specialists. We suggest that high-nature-value species should prevail in monitoring the effects of land-use intensification on biodiversity rather than total species richness."	44	0	0	0	41	0	44	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The data were classified using the hierarchical ISOmetric feature mapping and Partitioning Around Medoids, and ordinated through isometric feature mapping (ISOPAM). The environmental variables were related to the ISOPAM ordination.ResultsThe ISOPAM classification identified two clusters, five vegetation types and 17 plant communities, which were distributed across different elevations. There were notable differences in the diagnostic species, average percentages of endemic species, chorotypes and life forms among the various vegetation types and plant communities. The primary gradient in grassland vegetation was found to be associated with elevation and related climatic variables.ConclusionsThe study provides valuable insights into the montane grasslands of the Sierras Pampeanas in central Argentina. It presents a comprehensive classification of the region's grasslands, including tall tussock grasslands, humid grasslands, stony grasslands, and grasslands with scattered shrubs and trees. Each recognized unit is distinguished by diagnostic species and a distinct floristic composition. Our findings emphasize a significant division between grasslands at higher elevation, abundant in Andean species, and Piedmont and shrubby grasslands at lower elevations, characterized by a higher prevalence of Chacoan and other Neotropical species. Grassland vegetation in other regions of the Sierras Pampeanas remains poorly studied, requiring additional research to determine the syntaxonomic position of this vegetation."	2	0	0	0	1	0	2	2024-12-09	WOS:001368859900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Then, an expert system for automatic hierarchical classification was developed, based on the traditional system. The classification effectiveness was verified using fidelity measures, the occurrence of traditional characteristic species, consistency with semi-supervised K-means and modified TWINSPAN, and the similarity between each unit. To investigate correspondence to the environmental variables, a detrended correspondence analysis with the envfit function was used. Additionally, the occurring taxa were collated and compared with the flora lists of areas surrounding Japan.ResultsThe Japanese forest data set was classified into 34 alliances by the expert system, and 14 orders and six classes were distinguished. Most of these units had diagnostic taxa including existing characteristic species and the heatmap of the Bray-Curtis index showed the independence of each unit, and the similarity of the plot groups assigned to the same unit. Out of 34 alliances, clustering with semi-supervised K-means supported 21 alliances, and modified TWINSPAN supported 16 alliances. The four classes correspond to the thermal conditions and support the existing concept of vegetation zones. The lower-level vegetation units correspond to a narrower range of environmental variables than higher-level units, and species composition varied with limited environmental variables. A floristic composition comparison emphasized the complexity of the species composition of Japanese forests.ConclusionsThis study proposes the first formal Japanese forest classification at the class, order, and alliance levels, reflecting traditional phytosociology systems and based on large-scale vegetation plot data.

Our aims were to identify the main Iberian chionophilous vegetation groups, and analyse their plant diversity patterns and their role as refugia for snowbed glacial relicts, as well as that of Iberian high-mountain regions.LocationIberian high mountains.MethodsWe used the beta-flexible clustering method to classify 1002 vegetation releves of Iberian chionophilous vegetation, and computed species Indicator Values and frequencies for the resulting groups. We performed a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) ordination of the releves, and fitted six climatic variables to reveal the main ecological gradients. We constructed rarefaction curves to compare species richness between vegetation groups and between mountain regions.ResultsWe obtained eight vegetation groups, four consisting of snowbed vegetation and four of chionophilous grasslands. All but one group were present in the Pyrenees, where snowbed specialist richness was the highest. In southern and central Iberian ranges, snowbed vegetation was extremely scarce, and the main vegetation group corresponded to cryoromediterranean grasslands, where both species and specialist richness were the lowest. Snowbed and northern Iberian grassland groups accounted for similar high specialist richness, although specialists were infrequent and scarce at releve level in these grasslands.ConclusionsDespite the set of specialised species that thrive in snowbeds, many of them are also present but scarce in northern Iberian chionophilous grasslands. In a future scenario with a high reduction of snow cover duration, which may entail the disappearance of many snowbed vegetation patches, northern Iberian chionophilous grasslands may act as terminal refugia for snowbed specialists. Nevertheless, specialists are very threatened in central and southern Iberian ranges, where snowbed vegetation is infrequent and chionophilous grasslands provide almost no shelter to them."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2023-01-18	WOS:000903797500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Which classification at the alliance and suballiance level is the most convincing?LocationEurope and Asia Minor.MethodsWe applied a TWINSPAN classification to a data set of 24605 releves covering the whole range of Fagus sylvatica forests and the western part of Fagus orientalis forests. We identified 24 operational phytosociological units' (OPUs), which were used for further analysis. The position of each OPU along the soil pH and temperature gradient was evaluated using Ellenberg Indicator Values. Fidelity of species to OPUs was calculated using the phi coefficient and constancy ratio. We compared alternative alliance concepts, corresponding to groups of OPUs, in terms of number and frequency of diagnostic species. We also established formal definitions for the various alliance concepts based on comparison of the total cover of the diagnostic species groups, and evaluated alternative geographical subdivisions of beech forests.ResultsThe first and second division levels of TWINSPAN followed the temperature and soil pH gradients, while lower divisions were mainly geographical. We grouped the 22 OPUs of Fagus sylvatica forests into acidophytic, meso-basiphytic and thermo-basiphytic beech forests, and separated two OPUs of F.orientalis forests. However, a solution with only two ecologically defined alliances of F.sylvatica forests (acidophytic vs basiphytic) was clearly superior with regard to number and frequency of diagnostic species. In contrast, when comparing groupings with three to six geographical alliances of basiphytic beech forests, respectively, we did not find a strongly superior solution.ConclusionsWe propose to classify F.sylvatica forests into 15 suballiances - three acidophytic and 12 basiphytic ones. Separating these two groups at alliance or order level was clearly supported by our results. Concerning the grouping of the 12 basiphytic suballiances into ecological or geographical alliances, as advocated by many authors, we failed to find an optimal solution.

LocationSerbia, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Bulgaria and northern Greece. Methods: We extracted 5734 plots from the Balkan Dry Grassland Database corresponding to eight classes of dry grasslands reported from the region, using the EuroVegChecklist ES. This data set and later the plots within each derived subunit were subjected to a new numerical approach: starting with an initial partitioning (expert-interpreted TWINSPAN classification), diagnostic species were determined based on their phi-values for the target vegetation type and the differences in phi-values to the next similar types. These diagnostic species were fed into an ES to create a new partitioning, a procedure which was iterated until diagnostic species and species of the ES converged. Then the same approach was applied within each of the derived units to define the units of the next-lower level. Results: The iterative cluster optimisation (ICO) converged in all cases. The resulting hierarchical expert system (HES) classified 95% of all plots to alliances. We distinguished four classes with eight orders and 12 alliances: (1) Tuberarietea guttatae (Romuleion); (2) Stipo-Brachypodietea distachyi (Clinopodio alpini-Thymion striati); (3) Festuco-Brometea with Brachypodietalia pinnati (Chrysopogono-Danthonion calycinae and Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati), Festucetalia valesiacae (Festucion valesiacae), an unnamed order of rocky steppes (with Pimpinello-Thymion zygioidis) and Koelerietalia splendentis (Centaureo-Bromion fibrosi, Saturejion montanae and Diantho haematocalycis-Festucion hirtovaginatae); (four) Koelerio-Corynephoretea with Sedo acris-Festucetalia (Festucion vaginatae) and Trifolio arvensis-Festucetalia ovinae (Armerio rumelicae-Potentillion and Minuartio montanae-Poion molinerii all. nov.). Conclusion: sWe created a unified hierarchical classification with an electronic ES using diagnostic species defined by phi-values. Our new approach (ICO-HES: iterative cluster optimisation for hierarchical expert systems) allows dividing large data sets into meaningful units at several hierarchical levels, and thus has high potential for complex classifications.

We compared two collections of plot-based vegetation records originating from these two disciplines. The aim was to check the suitability of the collections for joint analysis and for addressing research questions from the opposing domains. We asked: are these collections complementary? If so, how can they be used for joint analysis? Location Europe. Methods We compared 13 311 phytosociological releves and 13 328 records from weed science, concerning both data collection properties and the recorded species richness. To deal with bias in the data, we also analysed different subsets (i.e., crops, geographical regions, organic vs conventional fields, center vs edge plots). Results Records from vegetation science have an average species number of 19.0 +/- 10.4. Metadata on survey methodology or agronomic practices are rare in this collection. Records from weed science have an average species number of 8.5 +/- 6.4. They are accompanied by extensive methodological information. Vegetation science records and the weed science records taken at field edges or from organic fields have similar species numbers. The collections cover different parts of Europe but the results are consistent in six geographical subsets and the overall data set. The difference in species numbers may be caused by differences in methodology between the disciplines, i.e., plot positioning within fields, plot sizes, or survey timing. Conclusion This comparison of arable weed data that were originally sampled with a different purpose represents a new effort in connecting research between vegetation scientists and weed scientists.

How does the current phytosociological classification of the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea vegetation differ among the NW Balkan countries?Location: NW Balkans (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia).Methods: 3635 releves originally assigned to the class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea were classified with a beta flexible method, and the crispness of classification was checked. DCA ordination with Pignatti indicator values and climate data were applied to show the influence of site conditions on species composition.Results: The classification was best interpreted at the level of 13 clusters, but could also be interpreted at the level of three groups of clusters. The first division was according to geography and climate: the first and third groups were concentrated in the NW part, while the second was restricted to the eastern part of the study area. The most important variable was site moisture, followed by nutrients and altitude, which corresponded with a west-east direction. The first group was very diverse and included communities on the wettest and most nutrient-rich sites (Potentillion anserinae, Cynosurion cristati, Calthion palustris, Molinion caeruleae, Molinio-Hordeion). The second group comprised mesophilous continental grasslands (Trifolio-Ranunculion pedati, Trifolion pallidi, Trifolion resupinati), while the third group consisted of grasslands from regions with abundant precipitation (Arrhenatherion elatioris, Deschampsion cespitosae, Pancicion serbicae, Triseto flavescentis-Polygonion bistortae).Conclusions: Our analysis can be used to unify different phytosociological classifications in different countries, also showing the transitional forms of well-known Central European vegetation types that have a different floristic composition and ecology in the Balkans.

However, the factors that determine the distribution of common species and the extent of their dominance and overlap are still being debated. Large-scale studies based on field data are of great interest in the face of biodiversity changes and climate change impacts. This research was designed to answer the following two questions: What are the dominant plant communities in the Patagonian steppes and how do they relate to environmental features, as measured by latitude, longitude, altitude, mean annual precipitation and mean temperature? What have been the recent changes in plant communities in terms of expansion and contraction of different types of communities?LocationPatagonian steppes (South America).MethodsWe used a large database of species-by-species vegetation cover from 426 monitoring plots in the South American Patagonian steppes, surveyed between 2007 and 2019, with two different assessment dates at least 5 years apart. We applied archetypal analysis to identify different vegetation compositions at a regional scale (called floristic archetypes) and to track their changes over time. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between floristic archetypes and spatial and meteorological variables to assess the association between floristic composition and the environmental context.ResultsSeven floristic archetypes were identified in the Patagonian steppes. The dominant and most widespread floristic archetype showed an expanding pattern in floristic trajectories and was positively associated with mean annual temperature. This floristic archetype was characterized by both drought- and grazing-tolerant species. Two floristic archetypes located at the longitudinal extremes showed decreasing relative participation in the vegetation configurations, and the archetype located towards the west showed a positive relationship with annual precipitation, suggesting a threatened scenario in the face of drier conditions. Southern floristic archetypes either showed a slight decrease or remained stable.ConclusionsPatagonian steppes are dominated by both drought- and grazing-tolerant species communities and their spatial distribution is expanding across different biomes, whereas the more forage-preferred species were associated with a decreasing floristic archetype. A projected drier and hotter climate scenario may potentiate this pattern. The floristic archetypes framework has potential as a monitoring tool for tracking changes in vegetation composition at a mesoscale and for identifying hotspots of vulnerable vegetation in the face of environmental changes.We studied vegetation compositions in Patagonia using archetype analysis, and their relationship with spatial and meteorological variables to assess changes over time and the association with environmental contexts.

The use of digital images in measuring plant species cover and species number in boreal forest vegetation was studied. Plant cover was estimated by manual delineation on photographs and subsequent digitized measurement of the areas. This value was regarded as the reference and compared with cover obtained by visual estimate, point frequency and automatic image analysis methods. The automatic image analysis was based on scanned photographs. Supervised image classification with ERDAS software was then used to distinguish between the covers of different plant species. When comparing the ability of the methods to detect species, the visual estimate method gave values similar to the reference. The study material was collected from three sites along a heavy-metal pollution transect in western Finland. All four methods detected, in a similar manner, differences between the plant species abundances along the transect. Compared with the reference, the digital images underestimated the cover of the lichens Cladina spp. and Cetraria islandica, but gave similar estimates for the dwarf shrubs Empetrum nigrum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea. The point frequency method overestimated the cover of all the species studied. The visual estimates of lichens were close to the reference, while the dwarf shrub covers were overestimated. The number of species detected using supervised image analysis and the point frequency method was lower than that with visual estimation. Visual estimation was faster, and the estimate closer to the reference cover values than the others. Digital images may be useful in detecting changes in some selected species in vegetation with a simple vertical structure but with taller, multilayered vegetation and a higher species number, the reliability of the cover estimates is lower."	55	2	0	0	39	0	68	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We applied clustering techniques to classify separately synoptic and releve data, and applied NMDS with passive projection of indicator values, climatic data and biogeographic geo-elements onto ordination diagrams to assist interpretation of the syntaxonomic patterns. We constructed elevation distribution profiles for alliances and classes of grasslands of several grassland classes from a broader study area to elucidate the relationship of the elevational sorting of the syntaxa in relation to latitude.ResultsThe analysis revealed six major vegetation types, classified into four orders: (1) Stipo pulcherrimae-Festucetalia pallentis, incl. (sub)montane rocky steppic grasslands of the Saturejion montanae of central Balkans, and the Koelerio-Festucion dalmaticae - submontane rocky grasslands of southern Serbia and Kosovo; (2) Astragalo onobrychidis-Potentilletalia represented by the Saturejo-Thymion (low-elevation steppic grasslands of southern Balkans); (3) Festucetalia valesiacae represented by grasslands on deep soil and low elevation of northern Greece, and finally (4) high-elevation rocky grasslands of southern Balkans, classified as a new alliance - Diantho haematocalycis-Festucion hirtovaginatae, that might belong to a new, yet undescribed, syntaxonomic order. Ordination suggests that the major differentiation of the high-rank syntaxa follows north-south geographic and low-high elevation gradients.ConclusionsBecause of the transitional biogeographic position of the studied region, as well as considerable large elevation span across latitudes, the diversity of vegetation types is high. The indication a putative new dry grassland order, the mid-high altitudes of the southern Balkans points to a need to re-assess the Balkan vegetation occupying the community niche between the low-elevation dry grasslands (Festuco-Brometea) and those typical of high elevations (Elyno-Seslerietea and Daphno-Festucetea), seeking parallels to patterns described from the western Alps, Pyrenees, and Apennines.

As a case study, we present the landscape classification of Hungary with a total area of 9.3 million ha.Location: Hungary.Methods: Data from the META (Magyarorszagi Elohelyek Terkepi Adatbazisa: GIS Database of the Hungarian Habitats) vegetation survey were used in our analyses. The basal units of the survey were hexagons with an area of 35 ha, in which surveyors estimated the cover of the various types of the (semi)-natural vegetation. The sample unit in our analyses was a rosette consisting of seven hexagons. The distance between sample units was calculated based on the relative cover of (semi-) natural habitats by Rao's beta diversity, a new distance measure that includes the similarities between habitats. A hierarchical classification was then performed using the UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) algorithm.Results: The optimal number of groups was 41 on the basis of average silhouette. Landscape types dominated by forests or grasslands were separated at the highest dissimilarity level. At lower levels, the division of groups could be attributed to differences in site conditions (dry, mesic, wet, saline). The most common landscape types (more than 400 occurrences) in Hungary are those dominated by zonal forests, degraded treeless habitats, xeric and mesic saline and alkaline habitats, and reedbeds and wet meadows. The rarest types (less than 50 occurrences) are mosaics of edaphic habitats, and coniferous forests.Conclusions: Landscape classification based on (semi-) natural vegetation may be used for estimating landscape diversity, landscape modeling, selection of study sites, regionalization of local scientific results, and for landscape development planning and nature conservation management. The new distance measure has met our expectations and resulted in a classification with clearly interpretable groups. It is likely that this distance measure may also prove to be appropriate for numerical syntaxonomy, in which the stability of the resulting groups may be increased by taking into consideration the similarities/differences in phytosociological preference of species."	17	0	0	0	12	0	17	2011-10-01	WOS:000294600100007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Determinants of plant community composition of remnant biancane badlands: a hierarchical approach to quantify species-environment relationships	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	14	3	NA	NA	378	387	NA	10.1111/j.1654-109X.2011.01131.x	Article	AUG 2011	2011	"Question: Which environmental variables best explain patterns in the vegetation of biancane badlands? What is the role of spatial scales in structuring the vegetation of biancane badlands within the agricultural matrix?Location: Five biancane badlands in Central Italy (Tuscany).Methods: An object-oriented approach on high-resolution multispectral images was used to classify physiognomic vegetation types in five biancane badlands. Within each badland, data on vascular plant species abundance were collected using a stratified random design. Variation partitioning based on partial redundancy analysis was used to evaluate the contribution of three sets of environmental predictors, recorded at the spatial scales of plot, patch and biancane badland in explaining patterns in plant community composition.Results: Environmental variables included in the final model - electrical conductivity and carbon/nitrogen ratio (plot scale), shape index (patch scale) and area (biancane badland scale) - accounted for 15.5% of the total variation in plant community composition. Soil characteristics measured at the plot level explained the majority of variation. In the smallest badlands, Bromus erectus perennial grasslands were absent, while annual grasslands, linked with harsh soil conditions (i.e. high soil salinity), were not affected by either the surface area of biancane badlands or by the soil nitrogen availability.Conclusions: The identification of the major predictors of patterns in remnant vegetation requires conducting investigations at multiple spatial scale. Management strategies should operate at different spatial scale, preventing any further reduction in the size of existing badlands and relying on habitat-instead of area-focused conservation practices."	25	1	0	0	16	0	26	2011-08-01	WOS:000292339800009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Hyrcanian ecoregion, Northern Iran. Methods A database of 1,597 vegetation plots of mostly 400 m(2) in size with a total of 802 vascular plant taxa was established, covering the whole geographic range of the Hyrcanian forests at altitudes ranging from -22 to 2,850 m a. s. l. An expert system was developed for automatic classification of vegetation plots into alliances and associations. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to determine the most important environmental and geographic gradients affecting species composition. Results Twenty-one associations and seven alliances of these forests, belonging to five orders and four classes, were defined. Among them, eleven associations and five alliances were described as new syntaxa. Alnion glutinosae and Smilaco excelsae-Alnion barbatae, both distributed in the lowland belt, include swamp and wet forests, respectively. Parrotio persicae-Carpinion betuli and Alnion subcordatae are respectively mesic and wet forests of the submontane belt. Solano kieseritzkii-Fagion orientalis is a mesic beech forest in the montane belt, and finally, Quercion macrantherae, an open oak forest, and Centaureo hyrcanicae-Carpinion orientalis, a dry hornbeam forest, occur in the upper-montane belt. DCA and CCA analyses showed that the distribution of these alliances and associations is mainly related to altitude and mean annual temperature. Conclusions Based on our results and comparison between the Hyrcanian and European forests, we propose a new, comprehensive syntaxonomic scheme for the Hyrcanian forests, supported by a classification expert system. Unlike previous studies, we linked the classification system to that of EuroVegChecklist because, though this area is outside of Europe, its vegetation is very similar to that of the European temperate forest vegetation."	63	3	0	0	54	0	68	2020-01-27	WOS:000507500400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We aimed to determine whether (a) classification of the kwongan vegetation of the Eneabba Sandplains leads to an ecologically informative classification scheme, and (b) we could identify environmental drivers underpinning the plant community patterns.Location: Township of Eneabba (29 degrees 82 ' S, 115 degrees 27 ' E), approximately 250 km north of Perth, Western Australia, covering 1,210 km(2).Methods: We used a data set consisting of 512 releves, collected following the standard field methodology of the Braun-Blanquet approach, and accompanied by an extensive set of environmental data consisting of 94 variables representing climate, fire, soil and terrain properties across 189 releves. The data were classified and ordinated by a series of multivariate analyses. OptimClass assisted in the selection of the most robust classification procedure. Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) inferred the major ecological drivers of the vegetation patterns.Results: Numerical classification, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and syntaxonomic tabular analysis revealed two major community groups (MCG A and B), eight community groups, and 17 communities in the kwongan vegetation of the study area. All vegetation units are characterised in terms of floristic composition and position along major ecological gradients in the studied area. The MCGs separated along a composite gradient of soil-texture and exchangeable cations. The first two db-RDA axes explained 21% of the total variance which is very low, considering the high number of environmental variables used.Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive insight into the high variability of vegetation types in hyper-diverse kwongan scrub at a landscape spatial scale; it is the first syntaxonomic account of the Western Australian kwongan vegetation, presenting a complete tabular comparative analysis. The studied major community groups segregate along a soil-texture and an exchangeable-cation content gradient. At a community scale, environmental filtering explained a small fraction of the vegetation-environment relationship. We suggest that the unexplained portion of the vegetation-environment relationship might be a product of slow-acting neutral processes in this hyper-diverse system; this assertion is amenable to rigorous future testing."	18	0	0	0	18	0	20	2018-11-27	WOS:000450061000013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Our aim is to produce a formalized classification of this vegetation and to identify the main factors driving its plant species composition at a continental scale.LocationAtlantic and Baltic coasts of Europe, Mediterranean Basin and the Black Sea region.MethodsWe compiled a database of 30,759 plots of coastal vegetation, which were resampled to reduce unbalanced sampling effort, obtaining a data set of 11,769 plots. We classified these plots with TWINSPAN, interpreted the resulting clusters and used them for developing formal definitions of phytosociological alliances of coastal dune vegetation, which were included in an expert system for automatic vegetation classification. We related the alliances to climatic factors and described their biogeographic features and their position in the coastal vegetation zonation. We examined and visualized the floristic relationships among these alliances by means of DCA ordination.ResultsWe defined 18 alliances of coastal dune vegetation, including the newly described Centaureo cuneifoliae-Verbascion pinnatifidi from the Aegean region. The main factors underlying the differentiation of these alliances were biogeographic and macroclimatic contrasts between the Atlantic-Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Sea regions, along with ecological differences between shifting and stable dunes. The main difference in species composition was between the Atlantic-Baltic and Mediterranean-Black Sea regions. Within the former region, the main difference was driven by the different ecological conditions between shifting and stable dunes, whereas within the latter, the main difference was biogeographic between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.ConclusionsThe first formal classification of the European coastal dune vegetation was established, accompanied by an expert system containing the formal definitions of alliances, which can be applied to new data sets. The new classification system critically revised the previous concepts and integrated them into a consistent framework, which reflects the main gradients in species composition driven by biogeographic influences, macroclimate and the position of the sites in the coast-inland zonation of the dune systems.

Associated documentation was consulted to compile species assemblages, and to identify indicator species, for national forest vegetation types. Indicator species were identified for each regional forest type by selecting those species that, among all the species listed for the same phytochorion (regional centre of endemism), were listed only for that forest type. For each of the national forest types, we counted the number of indicator species of the anticipated regional type. Floristic relationships (expressed by four different ecological distance measures) among national forest types were investigated based on distance-based redundancy analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using distance matrices and hierarchical clustering.Results For most of the national forests, the analysis of indicator species and floristic relationships confirmed the regional classification system for the majority of national forest types, including the allocation to different phytochoria. Permutation tests confirmed allocation of national forest types to regional typologies, although the number of possible permutations limited inferences for the Zambezian and Lake Victoria phytochoria. Two forest types from Ethiopia and Kenya did not correspond to regional forest types.Conclusions Our analysis provides support that as the classification systems are compatible, the resolution and information content of the vegetation map of Africa can be directly improved by adding information from national maps, probably leading to improved liability of its application domains. We found statistical evidence for a distinct Afromontane phytochorion. We suggest expanding the regional forest classification system with Afromontane moist transitional forest'.

Which environmental factors differentiate vegetation composition at the plot level: How can compositional pattern be best represented by a formal phytosociological classification. Location Soebatsfontein communal area and surroundings in the Namaqualand Hardeveld Bioregion of the Succulent Karoo Biome, Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Methods We recorded vascular plant species composition, together with a range of structural and soil parameters as well as grazing intensity, in 355 plots of 100 m2 size. This sample covered all vegetation types of the study area except those of river beds and anthropogenic sites. Vegetation classification was carried out using modified TWINSPAN followed by manual re-arrangement of a subset of plots with the aim of increasing floristic distinctiveness of the vegetation units. For the final vegetation units, we determined diagnostic species and environmental parameters, according to phi-values and ANOVA, respectively, and translated these into a phytosociological classification. Results The major factor influencing species composition and richness was soil salinity. At a broad scale, the less saline sites could be differentiated into sandy plains and rocky hills, and the saline sites into quartz fields, the centres of heuweltjies (termitaria) and the matrix between. We translated these patterns into two phytosociological classes with four orders, six alliances and 16 associations. Most of the syntaxa are very well defined in floristic terms, and all except the Othonnion cylindricae are new to science. The Hermannio trifurcae-Zygophylletea morgsanae represents the zonal vegetation of marginally saline soils, the Didelto carnosae-Cephalophylletea inaequalis the vegetation of saline soils. The vegetation of the extremely saline quartz patches probably belongs to a third class not described here due to the scarcity of representative plots. Conclusions Our phytosociological approach allowed the various degrees of ecological and floristic similarity to be represented by syntaxa of different ranks. A comparison with previous classifications from the Succulent Karoo revealed a high spatial turnover, with only two of our alliances and none of our associations coinciding with those found in previously studied areas of the Succulent Karoo.

To facilitate the development of vegetation science and its applications in natural conservation, a unified vegetation classification system is urgently required. Here we propose a unified eco-physiognomic-floristic vegetation classification system (EcoFloVCS) that combines eco-physiognomic and floristic characteristic classification systems.MethodsUnder the EcoFloVCS, plant communities are considered to have six key components (species composition, structure, habitat, development, locality, and function). Six associated characteristics are derived from these six components (dominant species, diagnostic species, physiognomy, distribution patterns, dynamics, and disturbance processes). These characteristics are used as the basis for community classification.Results and ConclusionsThe high-level units of this system agree with the UNESCO system, whereas the middle- and low-level units correspond to the Braun-Blanquet classification system. Both are connected by a Division (Subformation) unit. Based on the EcoFloVCS, a vegetation system was constructed for the four highest units worldwide that included seven Formation Classes, 22 Formation Subclasses, 39 Formation Groups, and 119 Formations. We assume that vegetation science will benefit from our unified EcoFloVCS through comparing and understanding community structures and functions on a global scale."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2024-12-13	WOS:001370970700001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, focussing on a pre-defined subset of species means that wider community-level differences may be overlooked. Can ancient semi-natural, ancient replanted, and recent woodland herb layer communities be distinguished by alpha, beta, and gamma diversity? How are any differences partitioned across AWI and non-AWI species communities? Location Cotswolds, southwest UK. Methods To quantify AWI and non-AWI responses to stand history in ancient semi-natural, ancient replanted, and recent woodland, we conducted floristic surveys of 45 sites. Using a modelling approach, we tested the relative and additive contribution of alpha-scale AWI and non-AWI species richness to woodland distinctiveness. Ordination was applied to analyse beta species composition distinctiveness, and multilevel pattern analysis was used to examine which species were significant contributors to gamma-scale richness differences. Results AWI species richness models significantly distinguished ancient semi-natural woodland from both ancient replanted and recent woodland at the alpha scale. For the classification of ancient semi-natural woodland and recent woodland, the hierarchical inclusion of non-AWI alpha richness resulted in a superior and more significant model. AWI gamma richness was numerically similar for all three woodland categories, whereas non-AWI was more varied. AWI and non-AWI species composition showed significant beta diversity differences among all woodland types, with six species being significant drivers of differences. Conclusions Our results have revealed previously undetected complexity in the contributions of AWI and non-AWI species to floristic distinctiveness of ancient woodland. In addition to traditional AWI species, the non-AWI assemblage also exhibited a sensitivity to habitat continuity that: (a) adds weight to the argument that ancient woodland is floristically distinct from recent woodland; and (b) provides a useful measure of success for ancient replanted woodland restoration."	6	2	0	0	7	0	11	2020-07-02	WOS:000541555800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We identified the main purposes and attributes on which to base the classification, defined assignment rules for vegetation plots, and prepared formal definitions for all the associations, alliances and orders of the class Phragmito-Magnocaricetea using formal logic. Each formula consists of the combination of functional species groups, cover values of individual species, and in the case of high-rank syntaxa also of discriminating species groups created using the Group Improvement (GRIMP) method.Results The European Phragmito-Magnocaricetea vegetation was classified into 92 associations grouped in 11 alliances and six orders. New syntaxa (previously invalidly published according to the International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature) were introduced: Bolboschoeno maritimi-Schoenoplection tabernaemontani, Glycerio maximae-Sietum latifolii, Glycerio notatae-Veronicetum beccabungae, Schoenoplectetum corymbosi and Thelypterido palustris-Caricetum elongatae.

We compared species composition among the habitat types using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). We then classified plant functional groups (PFG) based on four response traits: growth form, life span, plant height and flowering season, and compared richness patterns of PFG among the habitat types using analysis of covariance.ResultsThe estimated total richness was over 220 species in Slope_Paddy, Slope_Woodland, and Slope_Road, including more than 35 grassland species in each habitat type. Species composition at Levee habitat was significantly different from that at the other three habitat types as revealed by the NMDS axis 1 scores. The NMDS axis 2 scores for Levee and Slope_Road habitats were significantly different from those for Slope_Paddy and Slope_Woodland habitats. Species richness patterns along with the ten PFGs investigated in this study were also significantly different among the habitat types. Levee and Slope_Road habitats were characterized by a number of annual species, whereas tall perennial forbs, especially pteridophytes, characterized Slope_Paddy and Slope_Woodland habitats.ConclusionsWhile some species occurred in all four habitats, habitat specialists characterized by specific PFG responded to different disturbance regimes in each habitat type.

Moreover, we determined the mean cover percentage of life forms in all associations.ResultsAll high-alpine and subnival scree communities are arranged in one class (Didymophyso aucheri-Dracocephaletea aucheri), two orders (Physoptychio gnaphalodis-Brometalia tomentosi, Didymophysetalia aucheri), three alliances (Elymo longearistati-Astragalion macrosemii, Erigerontion venusti, Didymophysion aucheri) and ten associations, which are new to science, except for one association. The territory of the class extends from Alborz to NW Iran and probably to E Anatolia, Transcaucasia and the Zagros Mountains. Altitude, aspect and edaphic qualities are the major ecological factors influencing the species composition and vegetation mosaic.ConclusionsOur study introduces a formal syntaxonomic classification of the scree vegetation at high altitudes in Iran, thus providing a scheme for ongoing ecological surveys and monitoring programmes to assess the impacts of climate warming and of human land use on these unique ecosystems."	33	3	0	0	35	0	36	2014-01-22	WOS:000328544400015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) serve as an effective tool for classifying and mapping vegetation, and inform assessments and monitoring?Location: Voyageurs National Park, northern Minnesota, U. S. A and environs. The park contains 54243 ha of terrestrial habitat in the sub-boreal region of North America.Methods: We classified and mapped the natural vegetation using the USNVC, with 'alliance' and 'association' as base units. We compiled 259 classification plots and 1251 accuracy assessment test plots. Both plot and type ordinations were used to analyse vegetation and environmental patterns. Color infrared aerial photography (1: 15840 scale) was used for mapping. Polygons were manually drawn, then transferred into digital form. Classification and mapping products are stored in publicly available databases. Past. re and logging events were used to assess distribution of forest types.Results and Discussion: Ordination and cluster analyses confirmed 49 associations and 42 alliances, with three associations ranked as globally vulnerable to extirpation. Ordination provided a useful summary of vegetation and ecological gradients. Overall map accuracy was 82.4%. Pinus banksiana - Picea mariana forests were less frequent in areas unburned since the 1930s.Conclusion: The USNVC provides a consistent ecological tool for summarizing and mapping vegetation. The products provide a baseline for assessing forests and wetlands, including. re management. The standardized classification and map units provide local to continental perspectives on park resources through linkages to state, provincial, and national classifications in the U. S. and Canada, and to NatureServe's Ecological Systems classification."	25	3	0	0	23	0	37	2007-12-01	WOS:000250089300008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What are the main environmental factors affecting their diversity? What is their syntaxonomic position? Can we integrate them into the European vegetation classification system?Location Central and eastern Euxine Turkey and SW Georgia.Methods We collected 3104 vegetation plots of forest and shrubland vegetation in the study region and performed Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) classification. We described vegetation types based on the classification results, expert knowledge and information from literature sources. We defined diagnostic species and prepared distribution maps for each vegetation type. To determine the most significant environmental variables on floristic differentiation, we used canonical correspondence analysis. Detrended correspondence analysis with passive projection of most significant environmental variables was run to interpret the environmental variation of vegetation types.Results The studied vegetation was divided into 29 vegetation types related to seven main vegetation groups: relict Mediterranean forests and shrubland (mainly along the coastline, beside some inland localities), lowland to submontane forests, central Euxine mountain forests, eastern Euxine (Colchic) mountain forests, subeuxine forests, azonal riparian forests and subalpine and alpine shrubland. Elevation is the most important factor causing the differentiation in vegetation. It is followed by longitude and latitude. Among climatic variables, temperature seasonality, annual precipitation and precipitation of the wettest quarter are the most significant factors for vegetation differentiation. These factors correlate with the reduction of maritime climate and geomorphological features.Conclusions Vegetation types mostly correspond to the syntaxa accepted in the EuroVegChecklist. However, some of them do not appear in the EuroVegChecklist since they appear only beyond Europe. We described three syntaxa as new: Abietion equi-trojani, Querco cerridis-Carpinion orientalis and Piceo orientalis-Fagenion orientalis. The study revealed high vegetation diversity of the region that should be taken into consideration in ecosystem management and used as a reference in restoration and mitigation of the effects of global changes."	7	0	0	0	6	0	9	2023-12-23	WOS:001122107300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We applied agglomerative cluster algorithms (flexible beta/FLEX, average linkage/UPGMA, weighted linkage/WPGMA, complete linkage, Ward's clustering) and a divisive classification technique (TWINSPAN); data were reduced to presence/absence. We compared results against a published phytosociological classification (PHYTO), against environmental background data, and with respect to the presence of significant indicator species.Results: Complete linkage was inferior to other methods. TWINSPAN, UPGMA, flexible beta and WPGMA gave partly similar clusters, with FLEX and WARD showing the highest pair-wise similarity. Classifications of all methods except CL partly agreed with PHYTO classification. Clusters of all methods had significant indicator species, but Ward's method had the highest number of indicator species, followed by the PHYTO classification and FLEX, TWINSPAN, UPGMA and WPGMA. The latter four methods all yielded clusters that differed in terms of precipitation, but TWINSPAN, FLEX and Ward's method performed best under this criterion. PHYTO and CL ranked last in partitioning the precipitation gradient. Comparisons with ordinations indicated that classification algorithms capture the main floristic gradient but were less successful than the phytosociological approach to elucidate the finer structures.Conclusion: Performance of classification methods differed depending on the applied validation approach and we thus caution against uncritically adopting a single evaluation/validation criterion. Most numerical approaches can aid sorting of large data sets, while details of manual syntaxonomic classifications are not easily reproduced. Choice of the most appropriate classification and validation method thus clearly depends on the overall aim of a given study."	13	4	0	0	13	0	18	2011-10-01	WOS:000294600100009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How are these communities characterized by species origins, traits and ecological preferences?LocationAtlantic territories in the NW Iberian Peninsula (a.k.a. Cantabrian Mixed Forests ecoregion); south-western Europe.MethodsWe classified 2508 plots with the aim of being consistent with regional phytosociological expertise, while matching that expertise with current EuroVegChecklist alliances. We used modified TWINSPAN to revise the original phytosociological classification, followed by semi-supervised re-classification of the whole dataset. We determined the proportion of natives, archaeophytes, and neophytes. We also described the alliances in terms of species traits (lifeforms, height, and flowering phenology) and ecological requirements (temperature, moisture, light, nutrients, soil reaction, disturbance frequency, and severity).ResultsWe assigned 2086 vegetation plots to 25 anthropogenic alliances representing nine vegetation classes (Cymbalario-Parietarietea diffusae, Polygono-Poetea annuae, Papaveretea rhoeadis, Digitario sanguinalis-Eragrostietea minoris, Chenopodietea, Sisymbrietea, Bidentetea, Artemisietea vulgaris, and Epilobietea angustifolii). The plots included 1149 species: 78% natives, 15% archaeophytes and 7% neophytes. Vegetation groups were organized along a principal axis of abiotic stress (dry-sunny to moist-shady habitats) and a secondary axis of disturbance.ConclusionsIn the Iberian Atlantic territories, anthropogenic habitats host one third of the regional plant species pool and one fifth of the Iberian flora. Mesic perennial ruderal vegetation is especially rich in native species and can be a biodiversity asset in urban landscapes. Our biogeographical-level synthesis can improve the management of anthropogenic plant communities and contribute towards a European-level synthesis of human-made vegetation."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2025-01-19	WOS:001395413200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Elevation between 240 and 1,350 m a.s.l. in central Taiwan, East Asia. Methods We delimited the boundaries of landslides using aerial photographs taken between 1975 and 2015. We sampled 52 plots from 48 selected landslides and measured 21 environmental variables to identify the significant factors related to species composition. Cluster analysis and transformation-based redundancy analysis were used to determine the vegetation groups and corresponding environmental variables; the environmental differences between different vegetation types were evaluated by ANOVA. Results We classified the vegetation into four types and related each of them to a successional age, landslide position and soil pH, as well as Mn and Mg contents. Two early-successional types (aged 5-10 years) mainly occurred in habitats in steep slip zones, which are dominated by pioneer woody species and have a high coverage of grasses, forbs, or ferns thickets. In contrast, the mid-successional vegetation type (aged 16-40 years), growing on flat habitats, consists of pioneer woody species in the canopy layer and seedlings or saplings of shade-tolerant species in the understorey. Conclusions We confirmed that the composition and recruitment of species can be well explained by environmental differences between landslide zones and successional age. Some framework species and some shade-tolerant woody species can be applied to landslide scars with plant dispersal limitation problems and habitats suffering from poor local species pools, respectively. To overcome the problem of vegetation succession blocked by Miscanthus and ferns thickets, we suggest that pioneer woody species and herb species can be seeded on landslide scars at once for erosion control."	5	0	0	0	2	0	5	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Modifications were proposed and the modified protocol applied to the 10-ha old-growth stand and evaluated using permutation tests to assess the distinctiveness of primary attributes among types in the resulting typology.Results: We found a consistent bias in the classification protocol resulting from a failure of the prospect requirement: the compound classification rule rendered it virtually impossible for grid cells to be assigned to the Late Optimum phase. The proposed modified protocol alleviates this problem and was found to result in distinct types with statistically significantly different mean values for many primary attributes.Conclusions: Interpretations of a purported 'signature texture' for old-growth beech forests dependent on the absence of the Late Optimum phase when using the original classification protocol require reconsideration. The proposed modified protocol would be less susceptible to this bias, but caution is still advised, given the inherent constraints of the classification protocol at small scales."	33	1	0	0	23	0	35	2016-07-01	WOS:000384751300017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Using expert knowledge, 6574 of these plots were used to build a classification into broad vegetation types. The units of the resulting classification were formally defined using a Cocktail determination key, which can be used for the automatic assignment of new vegetation plots to these vegetation types.Results: Twelve vegetation types of zonal forests and nine types of azonal forests were distinguished. Zonal types in the subtropical region, from high mountains to foothills, are Juniperus subalpine coniferous woodland, Abies-Tsuga upper-montane coniferous forest, Chamaecyparis montane mixed cloud forest, Fagus montane deciduous broad-leaved cloud forest, Quercus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest, Machilus-Castanopsis sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest, Phoebe-Machilus sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest and Ficus-Machilus semi-evergreen foothill forest.

Along the temperature gradient, five altitudinal zones can be recognized. Azonal forest types develop at sites affected by the winter monsoon, on steep slopes, rocky soils, in seashore saline habitats and in places disturbed by fire, landslides and human activities.

The initial data set of 1056 plots was filtered according to physiognomic and floristic criteria, and geographically stratified. We used hierarchical agglomerative classification and semi-supervised classification techniques based on the k-means algorithm as a combination of methods to define vegetation types. A DCA analysis was performed to assess the main ecological drivers of diversity in the Molinio-Holoschoenion community.ResultsSeventeen vegetation types were defined, which can be classified in the following major vegetation groups: (1) tall humid grasslands on base-poor and sandy soils; (2) Scirpoides holoschoenus grasslands on base-rich soils; and (3) eastern Iberian and southwestern French Schoenus nigricans and/or Molinia caerulea grasslands. The water-logging gradient was recognized as a major underlying pattern influencing the diversity and distribution of Molinio-Holoschoenion, and at a second level, the soil factor.ConclusionsWe suggest a revision of the concept of the Molinio-Holoschoenion alliance to be considered for the interpretation of habitat type 6420 of the European Habitats Directive, which should include Mediterranean wet dune slacks and tall, humid inland grasslands.

The vegetation of these meadows has been the topic of few local studies, and little is known of species composition turnover across mountain ranges and along the latitudinal gradient. We sampled and analyzed community composition along a 1000-km gradient to answer the following questions: (1) what are the main community types in timberline meadows; (2) what are the most important abiotic gradients underlying their composition; and (3) how is species diversity related to environmental factors and how does it change along the latitudinal gradient?LocationSE and central British Columbia (Canada), NW Montana (USA).MethodsWe recorded data on cover and presence/absence of vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen species, as well as structure and environmental properties in 4mx4 m plots (n=112). Using the OptimClass approach, we classified plots into distinct community types. We used NMDS and multiple regressions to analyse the relationship between composition, species richness and environmental and geographic gradients.ResultsDespite drawing from a large geographic area, our classification revealed only four meadow communities. Mesic meadows were the most frequent and had a pronounced species turnover along latitude, resulting in two distinct community types. In addition, a three-dimensional ordination showed that vegetation structural properties, macroclimate and geographic predictors were important underlying gradients for species composition. Vascular species richness increased with soil pH, and exhibited a quadratic relationship with litter cover and latitude. Furthermore, in the latter case, it increased towards the southern and northern ends of our gradient.ConclusionsDetection of only four meadow communities along the 1000-km sampling gradient suggests a relatively recently established flora and a lack of regional differentiation consistent with the low level of endemism in the region. Higher vascular species diversity at the northern and southern edges of our gradient may reflect the geographic proximity to areas unglaciated during the Pleistocene, and suggests that areas farthest from the unglaciated edge may be experiencing colonization debt."	5	1	0	0	7	0	8	2014-01-22	WOS:000328544400014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We also explored how these plant communities differ in their endemisms, chorotypes and non-natives species composition, as well as in rock chemistry, elevation and climatic variables. Location Cordoba Province, Central Argentina. Methods The study was based on 505 phytosociological releves collected from 2009 to 2019 using the Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance scale. The hierarchical ISOmetric feature mapping and Partition Around Medoids (ISOPAM) analysis was applied. The vegetation matrix was ordinated through isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP), and the geochemical and bioclimatic variables were related to the ISOMAP ordination. Results We identified 14 plant communities distributed in three main clusters. We recorded 59 endemic species at the national level and 28 narrow endemics, restricted to the study area and nearby mountains. The number of non-native plants was relatively low (26 species). Perennial herbs (221 species), grasses (97 species) and shrubs (68 species) were the most prominent life forms. Plant communities were associated with rock chemistry (carbonate and acidic rocks), and also with elevation and climatic variables. Conclusion This study highlights the remarkable heterogeneity of outcrop vegetation in Central Argentina. It reveals that elevation and rock type (geochemical composition) were relevant factors associated with the floristic composition of plant communities and also, that outcrop habitats comprise a high level of endemisms, as well as a low number of non-native species, suggesting a high value for the conservation of local and regional biodiversity."	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2022-11-24	WOS:000882839100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In Finland, the Cajanderian forest site type classification is based on the composition of understorey vegetation with the assumption that it reflects in a predictable way the site's productive value. In Russia, the Sukachevian forest classification is similarly based on understorey vegetation but also accounts for tree species, soil wetness, and paludification. Here we ask whether Cajander's and Sukachev's forest types are effectively the same in terms of species composition, site productivity, and biodiversity. Location Boreal forests on mineral soils in Finland and the Russian part of Fennoscandia. Methods We use vegetation and soil survey data to compare the Cajanderian and the Sukachevian systems in terms of the understorey community composition (that is supposed to define them), soil fertility and tree productivity (that they are expected to indicate), and biodiversity (that is of interest for conservation purposes). We create and employ class prediction models to divide Russian and Finnish sites into Cajander's and Sukachev's types, respectively, based on vegetation composition. We perform cross-comparisons between the two systems by non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and statistical tests. Results Within both systems, the site types formed similar, meaningful gradients in terms of the studied variables. Certain site types from the two systems were largely overlapping in community composition and arranged similarly along the fertility gradient and may thus be considered comparable. Conclusions The Cajanderian and the Sukachevian systems were both developed in the European boreal zone but differ in terms of the exact rules by which site types are determined. Our results show that analogous types between the systems can be identified. These findings aid in endeavours of technology and information transfer between Finnish and Russian forests for the purposes of basic or applied ecological research and forest management."	18	1	0	0	16	0	19	2020-09-24	WOS:000568432900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Classification of South Brazilian grasslands: Implications for conservation	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	22	1	NA	NA	168	184	NA	10.1111/avsc.12413	Article	JAN 2019	2019	"Aims We offer a first classification of South Brazilian grasslands (Campos Sulinos) based on quantitative vegetation data and describing grassland types in terms of dominant and indicator species. Location South Brazilian grasslands (Parana, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul states). Methods We described vegetation plots in 167 sampling units throughout the region using a stratified nested design, totalizing 1,502 1 m(2) quadrats. We classified vegetation using cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, establishing three vegetation types and ten subtypes. We conducted indicator species analysis within the resulting subtypes, and for all possible combinations of subtypes. Results In the cluster analyses, a clear separation of poorly drained grasslands from the drier sites appeared. Further, a clear distinction between grasslands in the South Brazilian highland region, situated in the Atlantic Forest biome, and the grasslands of the Pampa biome, to the south, emerged, reflecting climatic and management differences. Highland grasslands showed lower species cover dominance, while in the Pampa, Paspalum notatum clearly was the most important species and the abundance of exotic species was higher. Conclusions Our study provides the first classification of South Brazilian grasslands based on quantitative vegetation data recorded in a standardized sampling design. The data support the division of grasslands into the main phytogeographic units of the region (Brazilian biome classification). Grasslands in these two regions also differ in terms of species dominance pattern (higher dominance in Pampa grasslands, likely also due to higher grazing levels) and in terms of conservation state (low presence of exotic species in highland grasslands). Our results are important for conservation policies, which can now consider the presence of different grassland types in different region, but more data will be necessary for a more detailed classification that considers different abiotic features in more detail."	99	1	0	0	82	18	107	2019-01-01	WOS:000459825800016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How are plant communities of these areas related to existing vegetation units of the European Vegetation Classification? What are the main environmental factors controlling transitions of vegetation along the bioclimate gradient? Location 1700-km Eurasia Arctic Transect (EAT), Yamal Peninsula and Franz Josef Land (FJL), Russia. Methods The Braun-Blanquet approach was used to sample mesic loamy and sandy plots on 14 total study sites at six locations, one in each of the five Arctic bioclimate subzones and the forest-tundra transition. Trends in soil factors, cover of plant growth forms (PGFs) and species diversity were examined along the summer warmth index (SWI) gradient and on loamy and sandy soils. Classification and ordination were used to group the plots and to test relationships between vegetation and environmental factors. Results Clear, mostly non-linear, trends occurred for soil factors, vegetation structure and species diversity along the climate gradient. Cluster analysis revealed seven groups with clear relationships to subzone and soil texture. Clusters at the ends of the bioclimate gradient (forest-tundra and polar desert) had many highly diagnostic taxa, whereas clusters from the Yamal Peninsula had only a few. Axis 1 of a DCA was strongly correlated with latitude and summer warmth; Axis 2 was strongly correlated with soil moisture, percentage sand and landscape age. Conclusions Summer temperature and soil texture have clear effects on tundra canopy structure and species composition, with consequences for ecosystem properties. Each layer of the plant canopy has a distinct region of peak abundance along the bioclimate gradient. The major vegetation types are weakly aligned with described classes of the European Vegetation Checklist, indicating a continuous floristic gradient rather than distinct subzone regions. The study provides ground-based vegetation data for satellite-based interpretations of the western maritime Eurasian Arctic, and the first vegetation data from Hayes Island, Franz Josef Land, which is strongly separated geographically and floristically from the rest of the gradient and most susceptible to on-going climate change."	10	0	0	0	6	0	11	2019-03-11	WOS:000459825800015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	17	3	NA	NA	556	566	NA	10.1111/avsc.12087	Article	JUL 2014	2014	"Questions: Several studies have demonstrated that data sets that combine vegetation plots recorded in different parts of the growing season might contain significant seasonal variability. The effects of this variability might confound some data analyses, such as vegetation classifications or beta diversity estimates, but the magnitude of these effects is unknown. Here, we try to quantify how strong these effects are, depending on the range of seasonal variation within the data set.Location: Southern Moravia, Czech Republic.Methods: We used two data sets of permanent plots (Forests and Dry Grasslands from the Czech Republic, each recorded in spring, summer and autumn) to analyse the similarity of partitions in hierarchical classifications with (1) different parameter settings (transformations of cover data and the beta parameter of the Beta flexible clustering method), and (2) different proportions of plots recorded in different parts of the growing season (added non-hierarchical k-means classification).Results: Single-season classifications based on the summer records were mostly robust to various cover data transformations and Beta settings, whereas spring and autumn records showed high variability in the resulting partitions. The comparisons of partitions based on the same parameter settings, but using two- or three-season data sets, revealed considerable discrepancies. In the analyses comparing summer records with seasonally heterogeneous data sets, the similarity of partitions rapidly declined after the substitution of a few plots recorded in different parts of the growing season, and non-hierarchical clustering showed higher partition similarity than hierarchical clustering alone in the Dry Grasslands. Compared to single-season data sets, we found higher beta diversity when combining spring and summer plots in both Forest and Dry Grassland data sets.Conclusions: The sampling date might strongly affect the results of classifications of temperate deciduous forests and dry grasslands. Therefore, for classification, we highly recommend using only summer-recorded plots. These plots are most robust with respect to various classification settings, correspond approximately to the phenological optimum of these vegetation types and are the most represented in vegetation databases from temperate regions. When the summer-recorded plots are less represented, we suggest careful seasonal stratification and the inclusion of information concerning the seasonal ratio of analysed data sets into each study."	9	0	0	0	8	0	10	2014-07-16	WOS:000337725300017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The goal of this study was to harness the potential of deep learning to advance habitat identification in Europe. We aimed to develop and evaluate models capable of assigning vegetation-plot records to the habitats of the European Nature Information System (EUNIS), a widely used reference framework for European habitat types.LocationThe framework was designed for use in Europe and adjacent areas (e.g., Anatolia, Caucasus).MethodsWe leveraged deep-learning techniques, such as transformers (i.e., models with attention components able to learn contextual relations between categorical and numerical features) that we trained using spatial k-fold cross-validation (CV) on vegetation plots sourced from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA), to show that they have great potential for classifying vegetation-plot records. We tested different network architectures, feature encodings, hyperparameter tuning and noise addition strategies to identify the optimal model. We used an independent test set from the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) to evaluate its performance and compare its results against the traditional expert systems.ResultsExploration of the use of deep learning applied to species composition and plot-location criteria for habitat classification led to the development of a framework containing a wide range of models. Our selected algorithm, applied to European habitat types, significantly improved habitat classification accuracy, achieving a more than twofold improvement compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method on an external data set, clearly outperforming expert systems. The framework is shared and maintained through a GitHub repository.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the potential benefits of the adoption of deep learning for improving the accuracy of vegetation classification. They highlight the importance of incorporating advanced technologies into habitat monitoring. These algorithms have shown to be better suited for habitat type prediction than expert systems. They push the accuracy score on a database containing hundreds of thousands of standardized presence/absence European surveys to 88.74%, as assessed by expert judgment. Finally, our results showcase that species dominance is a strong marker of ecosystems and that the exact cover abundance of the flora is not required to train neural networks with predictive performances. The framework we developed can be used by researchers and practitioners to accurately classify habitats.Hdm-framework, by leveraging vascular plant species composition coupled with environmental data, enhances vegetation classification, clearly outperforming the traditional expert systems on habitat type identification. The deep-learning models, trained on European flora, offer unparalleled accuracy, efficiency and robustness across diverse ecosystems.

The completeness and approach with which these subsets are sampled have implications for vegetation classification. Non-vascular plants are often omitted or sometimes treated separately, referring to their assemblages as synusiae (e.g. epiphytes on bark, saxicolous species on rocks). The distinction of complete plant communities (phytocoenoses or holocoenoses) from their parts (synusiae or merocoenoses) is crucial to avoid logical problems and inconsistencies in the resulting classification systems. We here describe theoretical differences between the phytocoenosis as a whole and its parts, and outline consequences of this distinction for practice and terminology in vegetation classification. To implement a clearer separation, we call for modifications of the International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature and the EuroVegChecklist. We believe that these steps will make vegetation classification systems better applicable and raise recognition of the importance of non-vascular plants in the vegetation as well as their interplay with vascular plants."	8	0	0	0	8	0	10	2019-12-06	WOS:000499061100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

An unsupervised classification (beta-flexible linkage method, Sorensen distance measure) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination were applied. Formal definitions of syntaxa based on species presence and covers, and respecting the results of the unsupervised classification, were developed and included in a classification expert system. Results The Oxycocco-Sphagnetea class, its two orders (Sphagno-Ericetalia tetralicis and Sphagnetalia medii) and seven compositionally distinct alliances were formally defined.

However, classification schemes of their vegetation and habitat types differ among European countries, and they are even ignored in some national schemes. This causes problems in conservation planning, monitoring and management. Hence we aimed at building the first unified vegetation classification for river gravel-bar habitats across European mountain systems.Location Europe.Methods In total 4,769 vegetation plot records of river gravel-bar plant communities were collected from national, regional or private databases, digitized from the literature and newly collected in the field. A hierarchical classification expert system with formal definitions of vegetation types was created. The definitions combined the criteria of presence or cover of groups of species with similar ecology or single species narrowly specialized to a particular gravel-bar habitat. The TWINSPAN classification was applied to early-successional vegetation types to check whether the classification based on formal definitions was supported by the results of unsupervised classification. Similarity patterns among vegetation types were visualized using the detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination.Results Early-successional and scrub gravel-bar vegetation types were respectively classified into two classes: Thlaspietea rotundifolii and Salicetea purpureae. Eleven associations and four alliances (Calamagrostion pseudophragmitae, Epilobion fleischeri, Salicion cantabricae and Salicion eleagno-daphnoidis) were defined formally. Based on a critical revision, some associations or alliances defined in the previous literature were merged or discarded. The main gradient in variability within the gravel-bar vegetation is connected with the altitudinal gradient, biogeographical variation, local hydromorphological processes and various successional changes.Conclusions The first unified and formalized classification system of the European mountain river gravel-bar vegetation was created, and species composition, ecology and distribution of these types were characterized.

Indicator species analysis was used to select the best dendrogram solution and identify diagnostic taxa of the main clusters. The dendrogram was interpreted from a syntaxonomic point of view, using nomenclatural type releves as a basis. The NMDS ordination was performed in order to visualize the floristic relationships among associations and high-rank syntaxa. MRPP was used to test for differences among alliances.ResultsThe classification revealed four main clusters of releves representing the chasmophytic vegetation of southern France, Sardinia and the northwestern part of Italy (Asplenienalia glandulosi/Asplenietalia glandulosi), the southwestern part of Italy and Malta (Tinguarrenalia siculae/Asplenietalia glandulosi), the Adriatic Basin area (Centaureo dalmaticae-Campanuletalia pyramidalis) and the southern Balkans (Onosmetalia frutescentis).

A first classification using noise clustering produced a large noise group containing over 50% of the releves. We then carried out a DCA to check the relative position of the noise group components with respect to the whole pool, and a K-means combined with species indicator analysis to obtain a more precise delimitation of clusters through their representative species.ResultsWe considered 17 groups as the optimum number of clusters when considering K-means and the corresponding indicator species. Pyrenean alpine vegetation separated first, showing a homogeneous pattern with a set of diagnostic taxa organized around two groups that coincide with one European class (Juncetea trifidi) and two alliances: Festucion eskiae in chionophilous environments and Festucion supinae in chionophobous habitats. The rest of the data correspond to the Iberian class Festucetea indigestae, recognized in three alliances corresponding to three territories: the Cantabrian Range, Central Iberian Peninsula (Sistema Central and Sistema Iberico) and Sierra Nevada. Four groups were extracted from the Cantabrian Range, which correspond to temperate (two groups) and Mediterranean (two groups) plant communities included in Teesdaliopsio-Luzulion. Two groups from Sierra Nevada - one oro- (Thymion serpylloidis) and another cryoromediterranean (Ptilotrichion purpurei) - were separated later on. Some relationships were found between the oromediterranean communities in the Central Mountains (Sierra de Guadarrama) and Sierra Nevada. This highlights the mediterranean character of this central Iberian mountain, compared to the rest of the central ranges (four groups representing cryoromediterranean vegetation) that were independently separated by the analysis and have a more submediterranean character. All are included in Jasionion carpetanae.ConclusionsThe Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Range show relationships in high-mountain vegetation but also differences since the Cantabrian Range has a major influence of Mediterranean taxa in their plant communities. Central Iberian mountains showed relationships with the other Mediterranean mountains through the presence of species of the Festuca indigesta gr. and other endemic taxa. The particular pattern of Sierra Nevada - very patchy and with lower cover values - hindered the separation of groups, but two groups were finally detected in the analysis based on the altitudinal gradient."	8	0	0	0	8	0	9	2017-07-04	WOS:000403676000018	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The resulting data set of 17 993 releves was classified using the TWINSPAN algorithm. We identified groups of clusters that corresponded to the class Festuco-Brometea. After excluding releves not belonging to our target class, we applied a consensus of three fidelity measures, also taking into account external knowledge, to establish the diagnostic species of the orders of the class. The original TWINSPAN divisions were revised on the basis of these diagnostic species.Results: The TWINSPAN classification revealed soil moisture as the most important environmental factor. Eight out of 16 TWINSPAN groups corresponded to Festuco-Brometea.

Using the available vegetation spatial data, we produced a composite map which identified 6323 wetlands >1ha. We then used the partitioning around medoids cluster analysis method for grouping wetlands based on 12 climate, topography, geology and soils spatial data layers and the wetland locations. We tested a range of cluster numbers from three to 20, and assessed the stability of the clustering by calculating mean silhouette widths. The derived classes were then characterized in terms of number of individual wetlands and their area, and also the number and area of individual wetlands found within protected areas such as national parks.ResultsWe found a peak in the mean silhouette width at 11 clusters, indicating that this was the optimal number of clusters for classifying the wetland data. We produced maps of wetland density for each of the 11 clusters and described the mean and mode environmental characteristics of each cluster. Each cluster represented a unique combination of environmental variables. For example, wetlands in cluster 2 are typically in the south, in areas of low evaporation and low average temperatures. An assessment of rarity found that wetlands in the largest cluster class had an areal extent of 14644ha, compared to 1414ha for the smallest cluster. All but one of the clusters had part of their range within protected areas.ConclusionsClustering environmental variables is an important but underutilized method for characterizing vegetation communities/ecoregions such as wetlands spatially. This approach can be used to produce objective, repeatable and defensible wetland community maps for assessing rarity."	16	1	0	0	14	0	17	2016-10-01	WOS:000386136600018	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What are the main diagnostic species of each type? What are the main environmental gradients that drive patterns of species composition? To what extent does biogeography influence community diversity?LocationIberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain, including the French Pyrenees).MethodsFormal definitions based on the Cocktail method were used to establish a typology of mesic grasslands of the Arrhenatheretalia order. This method was applied to a stratified data set of 3485 releves, also including other types of perennial grassland. Semi-supervised classification based on the K-means algorithm was used to assign almost 757 releves into the vegetation types defined by Cocktail and to identify new ones. The types were compared by means of detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) using climate data, altitude and Ellenberg indicator values as explanatory variables.ResultsFourteen ecologically well-defined associations were distinguished in the Arrhenatheretalia order: five in the Arrhenatherion alliance, two in Triseto-Polygonion and seven in Cynosurion. Soil reaction, summer aridity and altitude were identified as the most important determinants of species composition. These lithological and bioclimatic gradients are related to the biogeographic diversity of the study area, which is the main driver of community diversity in Arrhenatheretalia grasslands; it is more important than the management practices expressed in the concept of alliances. The classification and ordination analyses also showed a clear differentiation in community diversity according to biogeographic sectors (eastern Cantabrian-Atlantic, Galician-Portuguese, Carpetan-Leonese, Pyrenean, Orocantabrian/western Pyrenean and Oroiberian/Catalan-Valencian). In addition, moisture and nutrient content were more important than altitude in differentiating Arrhenatherion and Triseto-Polygonion communities in the Pyrenees.ConclusionsWe suggest a simplification of the traditional classification of the Iberian Arrhenatheretalia grasslands. For this revised classification, we propose an electronic expert system with consistent rules for assigning vegetation observations to the associations defined, and a list of the diagnostic species of each vegetation type. These results can be applied to identify and monitor the hay meadows included in Annex I of the European Habitats Directive, taking into account the biogeographic context of the indicator species."	28	1	0	0	27	0	30	2014-10-01	WOS:000342839200018	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, only a few of them have been included in the updated versions of the EuroVegChecklist so far. Here, we (1) review the new high-rank syntaxa published from Europe in the period 2017-2022 or before 2017 but not included in the EuroVegChecklist and (2) describe the temporal dynamics of publishing new high-rank syntaxa of European vegetation since the beginning of the Braun-Blanquet school in the early 20th century.Location Europe.Methods We searched for new descriptions of high-rank syntaxa from Europe by systematically reviewing the 2016 to 2022 volumes of 21 journals that regularly publish such descriptions. We also included syntaxa that were not listed in the EuroVegChecklist but were found through our additional non-systematic searches. We summarised the information on these syntaxa in a database and analyzed the frequency of descriptions of new syntaxa before and after the publication of the EuroVegChecklist.Results New syntaxa have been continually described for more than a century. There were several waves of new syntaxon descriptions, but no decrease in such descriptions after the EuroVegChecklist was published. We found 342 high-rank syntaxa (275 alliances, 48 orders and 19 classes) not included in the EuroVegChecklist, of which 69 were published before the EuroVegChecklist and 273 between 2017 and 2022. However, many of them were not described validly according to the International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature. Most of the new high-rank syntaxa were described both in the countries with well-studied vegetation (e.g., France, Italy, Spain) and in the countries with suspected gaps in vegetation research (e.g., Russia, Ukraine, Greece, Georgia).Conclusions As most of the newly described syntaxa have not been submitted to the European Vegetation Classification Committee for consideration, our list represents a source of information for vegetation scientists that complements the EuroVegChecklist and may serve as a basis for its future updates."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-10-07	WOS:001582992600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What are the main environmental gradients that drive patterns of species composition? Is it possible to classify these grasslands to phytosociological alliances that reflect management practices?LocationWestern and Central Europe (excluding the Alps and Carpathians).MethodsA database of 21 400 vegetation plots of mesic grasslands across Western and Central Europe was compiled. After geographically stratified resampling, semi-supervised classification based on the K-means algorithm was applied to assign a subset of plots into 32 a priori association-level vegetation types and to search for new types within the subset of non-assigned plots. The vegetation plots assigned into the final vegetation types were submitted to another K-means classification to show the grouping into higher-level vegetation types.ResultsA total of 36 associations were distinguished in the resampled subset of 8277 vegetation plots and were grouped into four large groups: (1) eutrophic and intensively managed hay meadows and permanent pastures; (2) nutrient-rich grasslands developed from recently abandoned fields or managed under irregular practices of mowing and manuring; (3) non-eutrophic lowland and submontane hay meadows; (4) extensively managed pastures and Atlantic grazed hay meadows. A PCoA of the associations of these four groups showed that extensively managed pastures were floristically more similar to non-eutrophic hay meadows than to permanent intensively managed pastures, which was more obvious in the Atlantic region than in Central Europe. Species composition of the lowland hay meadows was clearly differentiated according to biogeographic sectors. Other floristic differences were related to climate, altitude, soil base status and topography.ConclusionsThis analysis challenges the traditional concept of mesic grassland alliances separating hay meadows from pastures. New classification should be based mainly on the differences in management intensity rather than in management practice. Consequently, nutrient-poor extensive pastures, which currently are not considered in the European Habitats Directive, should receive the same conservation attention as low-intensive hay meadows, because both types of vegetation can be equally species-rich and do not differ substantially in floristic composition from each other."	27	0	0	0	23	0	31	2017-10-01	WOS:000412077700017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A comparative framework for broad-scale plot-based vegetation classification	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	18	4	NA	NA	543	560	NA	10.1111/avsc.12179	Review	OCT 2015	2015	"AimsClassification of vegetation is an essential tool to describe, understand, predict and manage biodiversity. Given the multiplicity of approaches to classify vegetation, it is important to develop international consensus around a set of general guidelines and purpose-specific standard protocols. Before these goals can be achieved, however, it is necessary to identify and understand the different choices that are made during the process of classifying vegetation. This paper presents a framework to facilitate comparisons between broad-scale plot-based classification approaches.ResultsOur framework is based on the distinction of four structural elements (plot record, vegetation type, consistent classification section and classification system) and two procedural elements (classification protocol and classification approach). For each element we describe essential properties that can be used for comparisons. We also review alternative choices regarding critical decisions of classification approaches; with a special focus on the procedures used to define vegetation types from plot records. We illustrate our comparative framework by applying it to different broad-scale classification approaches.ConclusionsOur framework will be useful for understanding and comparing plot-based vegetation classification approaches, as well as for integrating classification systems and their sections."	148	2	0	0	135	3	160	2015-10-01	WOS:000361181500002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Biogeographic patterns of base-rich fen vegetation across Europe	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	17	2	NA	NA	367	380	NA	10.1111/avsc.12065	Article	APR 2014	2014	"Questions What is the distribution of base-rich fen vegetation and the specialist species along European biogeographic regions? How do the gradients in species composition correlate to geography and climate at continental scale? What are the implications of such patterns for the classification of these habitats? Location Fifteen countries of Central, Western and Northern Europe. Methods We compiled a vegetation plot database of base-rich fens and related communities including vascular plants and bryophytes. The initial data set with 6943 plots was filtered according to the presence of specialists using discriminant analysis. We used DCA to analyse the correlation of species composition with geography and climate, and kriging interpolation for mapping gradients in the study area. Modified TWINSPAN was used to detect major vegetation groups. The results of the whole data set (plot size 1-100m(2)) were compared with those obtained from two subsets with plots of 1-5m(2) and 6-30m(2). Results Most of the specialists were distributed among all the biogeographic regions, but many were more represented in the Alpine than in the Atlantic, Boreal and Continental regions. Variation in species composition was mainly correlated to temperature, precipitation and latitude in the three data sets, showing a major gradient from (1) alpine belt fens characterized by spring species to (2) small sedge fens mainly distributed in mountain regions and (3) boreo-temperate fens reflecting waterlogged conditions. Conclusions Base-rich fen communities are widely distributed across European biogeographic regions, but the Alpine region can be considered as the compositional centre of this vegetation type. Large-scale gradients of species composition are mainly explained by climate, while the influence of latitude is probably correlated to increasing water table in the boreo-temperate regions. These gradients can be better understood by differentiating three major vegetation types, which should be considered when establishing classification systems of base-rich fens in Europe."	43	0	0	0	43	0	47	2014-04-01	WOS:000332774800017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How is species composition related to site conditions?Location: Catawba, Yadkin-PeeDee, Cape Fear, Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins, North Carolina Piedmont region, southeast USA.Methods: We recorded 194 alluvial vegetation plots. Vegetation types were derived using flexible beta-hierarchical cluster analysis and random forests classifiers to reassign misclassified plots. We used canonical correspondence analysis to show the relationship between species composition and key environmental variables.Results: Twelve forested vegetation types and two herbaceous types were distinguished, nested within a hierarchical classification structure of five higher-level groups. The five mega groups describe broad geomorphic-floristic conditions, whereas the narrower vegetation types characterize finer-scale floristic variation. Floristic variation is related to stream order and soil chemistry (pII and Ca:Mg ratio), as well as soil texture variables (percentage sand and percentage clay). We present a summary of floristic composition and structure, environmental setting and geographic distribution for each of the 14 vegetation types.Conclusions: We suggest recognition of 14 alluvial vegetation types in the North Carolina Piedmont.

Although their significance for biodiversity has been known, they have never been subject to systematic scientific research and thus, are not included in regional or national vegetation classification schemes. We provide the first vegetation survey of bedrock meadows and compare them to other major non-forest vegetation types in the region.Study area: Northwestern North America (United States, Canada).Methods: We surveyed 110 plots of bedrock meadow vegetation in Montana, Idaho, and British Columbia and compared them with data from 1052 plots from six studies of other open vegetation in the region: prairie and foothill grasslands, maritime mountain, alpine, and timberline meadows. We used cluster analysis to identify groups based on vascular plant composition, related abiotic and structural characteristics to clusters using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), and compared proportions of plant growth forms and life spans.Results: Cluster analysis identified five groups, with bedrock meadows forming a distinct community. According to the NMDS, bedrock meadows had a high cover of vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens and a low cover of litter. Their climate was intermediate between maritime mountain and interior timberline meadows. A distinct functional feature of bedrock meadows was their high proportions of annual plants (therophytes) and plants regenerating from bulbs and corms (geophytes)-a functional composition they shared with maritime mountain meadows.Conclusion: Bedrock meadows have distinct floristic, functional, and environmental features, are important hotspots for biodiversity, and host several rare plant species. They are an important habitat for conservation and environmental impact assessment and should be incorporated into regional and national classification schemes. Future research priority should be given to understanding their spatial extent, ecological functioning, and drivers of non-vascular and vascular species richness."	2	0	0	0	2	0	3	2023-01-20	WOS:000903797200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Our aim is to provide the first broad-scale classification of these pine forests based on a large data set of vegetation plots.Location: Southern Europe, North Africa, Levant, Anatolia, Crimea and the Caucasus.Methods: We prepared a data set of European and Mediterranean pine forest vegetation plots. We selected 7,277 plots dominated by the cold-sensitive Mediterranean pine species Pinus brutia, Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinaster and Pinus pinea. We classified these plots using TWINSPAN, interpreted the ecologically and biogeographically homogeneous TWINSPAN clusters as alliances, and developed an expert system for automatic vegetation classification at the class, order and alliance levels.Results: We described Pinetea halepensis as a new class for the Mediterranean lowland to submontane pine forests, included in the existing Pinetalia halepensis order, and distinguished 12 alliances of native thermophilous pine forests, including four newly described and three informal groups merging supposedly native stands and old-established plantations. The main gradients in species composition reflect elevational vegetation belts and the west-east, and partly north-south, biogeographical differences. Both temperature and precipitation seasonality co-vary with these gradients.Conclusions: We provide the first formal classification at the order and alliance levels for all the Mediterranean thermophilous pine forests based on vegetation-plot data. This classification includes traditional syntaxa, which have been critically revised, and a new class and four new alliances. We also outline a methodological workflow that might be useful for other vegetation classification syntheses.

Location Northeastern Australia. Methods Two classifications of savanna plant communities were formed independently with two different approaches: supervised and un-supervised (using agglomerative hierarchical clustering). Each approach used the same vegetation datasets and, importantly, classification criteria. The communities occur on two different landscapes, with differing environmental gradients, covering an area of 53,500 km(2). We compared the internal characteristics of plant communities between approaches and landscapes using four evaluation criteria: identifiability, distinctiveness, similarity of internal heterogeneity and predictability of species foliage cover. Additionally, we compared the central floristic concepts and compositional boundaries of communities identified by each approach. Results Supervised and un-supervised approaches recognised similar floristic community concepts. Compositional boundaries between communities were similar on the landscape with steeper environmental gradients but significantly different on the landscape with gradual environmental gradients. However, communities distinguished using supervised methods were significantly less distinct and identifiable, worse at predicting species foliage cover and significantly more variable in species composition than those identified using un-supervised methods. Conclusions Using supervised rather than un-supervised approaches to distinguish plant communities can result in less recognisable communities, possibly reducing their usefulness for land management planning. Importantly, we found a large disparity between the two approaches in delineating compositional boundaries between communities on landscapes with gradual environmental gradients. This is particularly relevant to communities in biomes such as the savanna which comprises 20% of the Earth's landmass. Ecologists can be more confident using a supervised approach on landscapes with steep environmental gradients but should target landscapes with gradual environmental gradients for un-supervised classification."	3	1	0	0	3	0	6	2019-06-01	WOS:000473236900002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

For classifying plots to vegetation types, covers are often transformed to decrease the effect of dominant species. However, it remains unclear which transformation is optimal. We suggest that for vegetation classification, optimal is such transformation that contributes to creating clusters of plots in an unsupervised classification that are most similar to the widely accepted vegetation types, e.g., phytosociological associations. Here our aim is to find and recommend such optimal transformation by testing a range of transformation options against the national vegetation classifications of three European countries. Location Czech Republic, The Netherlands, Great Britain. Methods Three national datasets of vegetation plots with species cover information, classified to associations or community types of the respective national vegetation classification systems, were analysed. From each dataset, multiple subsets of plots were selected randomly, each subset representing a vegetation-plot table containing several similar associations/community types. Species cover values in these subsets were subjected to various transformations (power transformation, logarithmic transformation and pseudo-species cut levels). Then each subset was classified by an agglomerative classification method (beta-flexible clustering with different beta values), and the classification was compared with the units of the national vegetation classification using the adjusted Rand index. Results Power transformations of percentage covers with an exponent between 0.3 and 0.6 produced the best match between the unsupervised classifications and the national vegetation classifications. This result did not depend on the classification method used. A similar degree of matching was achieved with some cut levels of pseudo-species and with logarithmic transformation of percentage cover.

Here we propose a unified vegetation classification of European fens at the alliance level, provide unequivocal assignment rules for individual vegetation plots, identify diagnostic species of fen alliances, and map their distribution.Location: Europe, western Siberia and SE Greenland.Methods: 29 049 vegetation-plot records of fens were selected from databases using a list of specialist fen species. Formal definitions of alliances were created using the presence, absence and abundance of Cocktail-based species groups and indicator species. DCA visualized the similarities among the alliances in an ordination space. The ISOPAM classification algorithm was applied to regional subsets with homogeneous plot size to check whether the classification based on formal definitions matches the results of unsupervised classifications.Results: The following alliances were defined: Caricion viridulo-trinervis (sub-halophytic Atlantic dune-slack fens), Caricion davallianae (temperate calcareous fens), Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis (arcto-alpine calcareous fens), Stygio-Caricion limosae (boreal topogenic brown-moss fens), Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnion nitentis (Sphagnum-brown-moss rich fens), Saxifrago-Tomentypnion (continental to boreo-continental nitrogen-limited brown-moss rich fens), Narthecion scardici (alpine fens with Balkan endemics), Caricion stantis (arctic brown-moss rich fens), Anagallido tenellae-Juncion bulbosi (Ibero-Atlantic moderately rich fens), Drepanocladion exannulati (arcto-boreal-alpine non-calcareous fens), Caricion fuscae (temperate moderately rich fens), Sphagno-Caricion canescentis (poor fens) and Scheuchzerion palustris (dystrophic hollows). The main variation in the species composition of European fens reflected site chemistry (pH, mineral richness) and sorted the plots from calcareous and extremely rich fens, through rich and moderately rich fens, to poor fens and dystrophic hollows. ISOPAM classified regional subsets according to this gradient, supporting the ecological meaningfulness of this classification concept on both the regional and continental scale. Geographic/macroclimatic variation was reflected in the second most important gradient.Conclusions: The pan-European classification of fen vegetation was proposed and supported by the data for the first time. Formal definitions developed here allow consistent and unequivocal assignment of individual vegetation plots to fen alliances at the continental scale."	88	0	0	0	88	0	102	2017-01-01	WOS:000396473500014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Nevertheless, the process of plot assignment to types is usually non-standardized, and assignment consistency remains poorly explored. To date, the efficiency of automatic classification programs has been assessed by comparing them with a unique expert judgment. Therefore, we investigated the consistency of five phytosociology expert judgments, and the consistency of these judgements with those of automatic classification programs. Location Mainland France. Methods We used 273 vegetation plots distributed across France and covering the diversity of the temperate and mountainous forest ecosystems of Western Europe. We asked a representative panel of five French organizations with recognized expertise in phytosociology to assign each plot to vegetation units. We provided a phytosociological classification including 228 associations, 43 alliances and eight classes. The assignments were compared among experts using an agreement ratio. We then compared the assignments suggested by three automatic classification programs with the expert judgments. Results We observed small differences among the agreement ratios of the expert organizations; a given expert organization agreed with another one on association assignment one time in four on average, and one time in two on alliance assignment. The agreement ratios of the automatic classification programs were globally lower, but close to expert judgments. Conclusions The results support the current trend toward unifying the existing classifications and specifying the assignment rules by creating guiding tools, which will decrease inter-observer variation. As compared to a pool of phytosociology experts, programs perform similarly to individual experts in vegetation unit assignment, especially at the alliance level. Although programs still need to be improved, these results pave the way for the creation of habitat time series crucial for the monitoring and conservation of biodiversity."	6	0	0	0	5	0	7	2020-08-07	WOS:000556428500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

After filtering of plots according to their area and geographic stratification, 1892 plots were used to build a typology from association to order level using multivariate classification methods (Fuzzy C-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering). The phi fidelity index was used to determine the diagnostic species of the syntaxa in the proposed classification. Main climatic gradients were explored using non-metric multidimensional gradient analysis, and ANOVA was carried out in order to define the bioclimatic features of Iberian floodplain forests.Results: A total of 41 floodplain forest associations were distinguished for the Iberian Peninsula, grouped in nine suballiances, four alliances and two orders. Mediterraneity (summer aridity) was the main climatic driver, as it separates the temperate floodplain forests of the order Alno-Fraxinetalia from the Mediterranean forests of the Populetalia albae. Continentality and precipitation were mainly relevant at alliance level, as they separated both the temperate alliances Alnion and Hyperico-Alnion, the latter more oceanic, and the Mediterranean alliances Populion and Osmundo-Alnion, the latter from more rainy areas. Temperature was an important driver at association level, as the associations included in the same suballiance or alliance differed regarding their thermicity index.Conclusions: Our study develops the first formalized classification of Iberian floodplain forests and provides their bioclimatic diagnosis. One new alliance, Hyperico-Alnion, is proposed for floodplain forests of the Cantabrian watershed. Mediterraneity, continentality and precipitation drive floodplain forest diversity at broad scale, while temperature is the main bioclimatic driver at fine scale. The proposed classification provides the scientific basis for the conservation of this habitat type, with high conservation priority, in southern Europe."	25	2	0	0	21	0	29	2016-06-01	WOS:000374545600016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Therefore, we aim to provide a vegetation classification and to describe the main biogeographical patterns of floodplain forests and alder carrs in Europe.Location: Europe.Methods: A database of more than 40 000 vegetation plots of floodplain forests and alder carrs across Europe was compiled. After geographic stratification, 16 392 plots were available for classification, which was performed using the supervised method Cocktail. We also searched for new associations using semi-supervised K-means classification. The main biogeographic patterns and climate-related gradients in species composition were determined using detrended correspondence analysis and cluster analysis.Results: Thirty associations of floodplain forests and alder carrs were distinguished, which belong to five alliances. The Alnion incanae includes riparian, seepage and hardwood floodplain forests in the nemoral and hemiboreal zones (dominated by Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior) and in the boreal zone (dominated by A. incana). The Osmundo-Alnion represents oceanic vegetation dominated by Alnus glutinosa, Fraxinus angustifolia and F. excelsior distributed mostly on the Iberian Peninsula and composed of species with Atlantic distribution and Iberian endemics. The Populion albae comprises floodplain forests frequently dominated by Fraxinus angustifolia, Populus alba and P. nigra that are widespread in floodplains of large rivers under summer-dry climates in the Mediterranean region. The Platanion orientalis represents eastern Mediterranean floodplain forests dominated by Platanus orientalis. The Alnion glutinosae includes forest swamps dominated by Alnus glutinosa distributed mostly in the nemoral and hemiboreal zones. The main biogeographic patterns within European floodplain forests and alder carrs reflect the climatic contrasts between the Mediterranean, nemoral, boreal and mountain regions. Oceanic floodplain forests differ from those in the rest of Europe. The hydrological regime appears to be the most important factor influencing species composition within regions.Conclusions: This study is the first applying a formalized classification at the association level for a broad vegetation type at the continental scale.

We determined the database clustering tendency (Hopkins' test analysis) and estimated its optimal number of clusters (Elbow method). We performed a cluster analysis (modified TWINSPAN) and improved the validity of the resulting groups by approximating natural clustering using the Silhouette algorithm. We visualized the results by calculating Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling and drawing distribution maps for the observed vegetation communities.ResultsWe distinguished nine classes representing Sinai desert vegetation: Salicornietea fruticosae, Retametea raetam, Haloxylonetea salicornici, Retamo-Tamaricetea fluviatilis, Acacietea tortilis, Artemisietea herbae-albae, Anabasietea articulatae, Chiliadenetea iphionoidis, and Stellarietea mediae. We distinguished 25 vegetation groups, of which seven are new findings, representing four main vegetation groups: salt desert, lowland desert, mountain desert, and ruderal desert. We observed a high diversity in life forms, chorotypes, and alpha-diversity of the vegetation among the main groups. Therophytes, chamaephytes, hemicryptophytes, and phanerophytes are the dominant life forms. Prevailing chorotypes are Saharo-Arabian, Mediterranean, Mediterranean-Irano-Turanian and Irano-Turanian-Saharo-Arabian. The salt desert and lowland desert vegetation are species-poor, whereas the mountain desert vegetation is relatively species-rich. The ruderal desert vegetation is the most species-rich.ConclusionWe present a common classification of Sinai desert vegetation based on cutting-edge methods and provide an updated description of the desert vegetation groups of Sinai.

What are their ecological relationships in the zonal and successional gradients typical of coastal dune systems? Does climate affect the latitudinal distribution of the azonal vegetation? What other environmental factors influence their distribution on the regional or local scale?Location: Pacific coast of North America, from Baja California (23 degrees 02' N) to Cook Inlet, Alaska (61 degrees 30' N).Methods: A total of 1730 phytosociological releves were obtained by sampling 279 coastal localities. In all localities, zonation was interpreted by considering transects from the shoreline inland. Through traditional phytosociological tabular classification and average linkage clustering, releves were syntaxonomically classified. Syntaxa, supported by fidelity calculations, are described and interpreted according to their phytogeographical distribution, their relationships with macrobioclimate (MB) and bioclimates (BIO), and to the topographic and ecological gradients typical of coastal sandy areas.Results: Our bioclimate analysis served to define four MB and 11 BIO, each characterized by a particular type of potential natural vegetation. By floristically analysing the 522 vascular taxa detected, these were related to 16 phytogeographical elements. Syntaxonomically, the communities observed comprise 74 vegetation types, 70 of which are considered associations characterized by their diagnostic combination of species. These associations were classified into 24 alliances, 16 orders and 12 phytosociological classes. Two new classes, five new orders, 10 new alliances and 34 new associations are presented. Some syntaxa have been revised or validated.Conclusions: The coastal vegetation of the northern Pacific shows a distribution that is mainly linked to the four MB of the latitudinal gradient examined. Higher syntaxa are preferentially linked to a macrobioclimate, although some edaphic factors determine that some occupy two different but geographically close bioclimate zones. Regional factors, such as alkaline sands, induce the appearance of specialized vegetation types rich in endemic plants."	22	0	0	0	18	4	23	2011-09-21	WOS:000294600100003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In the paper we describe the classification of Danish grasslands according to the Habitats Directive of the European Union, and demonstrate how a supervised classification can be used to achieve a standardized and statistical interpretation within a local flora. We thereby offer a statistical solution to the legal problem of protection of certain selected habitat types. The Habitats Directive protects three types of Danish grassland habitats, whereas two remaining types fall outside protection. A classification model is developed, using available Danish grassland data, for the discrimination of these five types based on their species composition. This new Habitats Directive classification is compared to a previously published unsupervised classification of Danish grassland vegetation. An indicator species analysis is used to find significant indicator species for the three protected habitat types in Denmark, and these are compared to the characteristic species mentioned in the interpretation manual of the Habitats Directive.

Then, we used the EUNIS Habitat Classification expert system, the modified Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and the semi-supervised k-means classification to classify all Forest plots into regionalised EUNIS habitat types. We determined the environmental space of each ecological forest type with bioclimatic and soil variables, and computed principal components analysis (PCA), generalised linear models (GLMs) and PERMANOVA to evaluate climatic differences among forests.ResultsWe identified 24 ecological forest habitat types (12 broadleaved deciduous, seven broadleaved evergreen and five coniferous), whose regional distribution is mainly driven by the oceanic influence and the amount and seasonality of annual precipitation. Most forest types had a specific climatic optimum, but there were also climatic overlaps in habitats traditionally favoured by human activities.ConclusionsThe Cantabrian Mixed Forests ecoregion is a hotspot of forest diversity within the temperate deciduous forest biome in Europe, including multiple functional and ecological forest types. Such forest diversity is explained by present macro- and mesoclimatic heterogeneity, Pleistocene refugia, and the legacy of human intervention during the Holocene.The Cantabrian Mixed Forests ecoregion is a meeting-point for deciduous, evergreen and coniferous forest diversity in southern Europe.

However, their national classification systems are poorly compatible, and a broad-scale classification based on numerical analyses is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to establish a unified formalized classification system based on a large data set of vegetation plots covering the entire range of these forests.Location: Europe, Anatolia, Caucasus and northern Iran.Methods: We compiled a data set of 15,817 vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive and the Hyrcanian Forest Vegetation Database, using the formal definition of the EUNIS habitat type T1E Carpinus and Quercus mesic deciduous forest. We classified the data set using TWINSPAN. Biogeographically and ecologically similar plot clusters were merged into oak-hornbeam forest types, which were interpreted as alliances. We also developed expert systems for automatically classifying vegetation at the alliance level for both the EuroVegChecklist (EVC) system and the revised classification. In addition, we calculated ordinations to show the major gradients in the species composition of the data set.Results: We present a revised classification system of the order Carpinetalia betuli with nine alliances, including basic descriptions of their species composition, distribution, ecology and syntaxonomy. The analyses largely supported the biogeographic concept of classification, analogous to EVC. Compared to EVC, we recognized an additional alliance Physospermo verticillati-Quercion cerridis (southern Italy) but found no support for the alliances Astrantio-Carpinion, Erythronio-Carpinion and Scillo-Quercion. The greatest difference in species composition was found between the southern and northern-northeastern Carpinetalia types. Expert systems for the revised classification system (similar to 89% of plots classified) and the EVC system (similar to 72%) are also included.Conclusions: We provide the first comprehensive overview of alliances of the order Carpinetalia betuli across its whole distribution range.

Objective The present article documents a joint phytosociological and geographical approach to improve vegetation cartography in temperate-tropical transitional ecosystems. Location The research was conducted at national (Mexico) and state (Michoacan) scales. Mexico and Michoacan have been recognized as regions of high eco-geographical complexity, where temperate-tropical conditions intermingle, creating large eco-socio-cultural mosaics. Methods Data from 268 field verification sites and 223 releves surveyed during the last two decades and recent land cover sources were used as the main inputs. The results were further validated by three workshops with local botanists and field verification during 2021. Results At the national level, Mexico's forests, shrubs, herbs, and non-vascular major formation classes were hierarchically split by dominant life forms and prevailing climatic affiliations. At the state level, these major formation classes split into 19 sub-formations, of which 15 were forest communities.

The vegetation survey on 194 releves in a nested plot design of up to 100 m(2) encompassed examiniation of various site conditions. We applied cluster and indicator species analysis for vegetation classification, and indirect multivariate ordination to assess vegetation-environment relationships.Results: We classified 13 unranked communities in two sub-alpine groups and one alpine group, plus the very distinct vegetation around camp sites of semi-nomadic herders. Important drivers for vegetation differentiation are altitude as proxy for temperature, latitude as proxy for orographically founded differences in bedrock and precipitation, aspect, soil factors, such as content of organic matter and variables connected to land-use types and intensity (e.g. pasturing vs hay meadows, browsing tracks). In consequence, also effects on species richness are detectable. Furthermore, we found only partial concordance of our communities with existing vegetation classifications in the Greater Caucasus.Conclusions: A state-of-the-art classification and ordination of regional high-mountain grassland communities and their environmental drivers fills a gap in knowledge about this vegetation. It is widely unknown to international audience and remained almost unstudied during the last 25 yr, when severe shifts in land use remarkably changed the natural conditions.

These were clustered into emergent groups according to 14 life-traits related to plant dispersal, establishment and persistence. Forest fragments were classified according to similar distribution of the identified emergent groups. Environmental factors were related to the emergent group richness in each forest type using generalized linear models.Results: Contrary to former species centred classifications, only two groups of forests, each with clearly different emergent group composition and conservation requirements, were detected: (1) swamp forests characterized by anemogamous perennials, annuals and hydrochorous perennials and (2) moist forests characterized by barochorous perennials, small geophytes and zoochorous phanerophytes. From a conservation point of view, priority should be given to large swamp forest with intact flooding regimes. This is in accordance with the high wind and water dispersal capacities of their typical emergent groups. For the moist forests, conservation priorities should be high forest connectivity and historical continuity since dispersal and establishment of their characteristic emergent groups are highly limited.Conclusions: The described methodology, situated at an intermediate integration level between the individual species and whole community descriptors, takes advantage of both conservation plans built for single species and the synthetic power of broad ecological measures."	26	0	0	0	23	0	28	2007-04-01	WOS:000245934700009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Nevertheless, there is little evidence as to whether this link is maintained at fine scales, as well as to how it is influenced by vegetation's vertical complexity. Here we test, at the community level in grasslands, the link between diversity of the spectral signal (S-Div) and taxonomic diversity (T-Div), and the influence of vertical complexity. Methods We used 196 1.5 m x 1.5 m experimental communities with different biodiversity levels. To measure vertical complexity, we quantified height diversity (H-Div) of the most abundant species in the community. T-Div was calculated using the Shannon index based on species cover. Canopy spectral information was gathered using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted with a multi-spectral sensor providing spectral information via six 10-nm bands covering the visible and near-infrared region at a spatial resolution of 3 cm. We measured S-Div in a core area of 1 m x1 m within the communities as mean Euclidean distance of all pixels in a feature space spanned between the two first components of a PCA calculated for the complete raster stack. We modelled S-Div through mixed-effect linear models, using T-Div, H-Div, and their interaction as fixed-effect predictors. Results Contrary to our expectations, T-Div was negatively linked to S-Div. The diversity in plant height was positively related to S-Div. More importantly, diversity in plant height and T-Div had a significant negative interaction, meaning the more complex the vegetation was in terms of height, the more the S-Div-T-Div relationship became negative. Conclusions Our results suggest that in order to exploit the S-Div-T-Div link for monitoring purposes, it needs to be contextualized. Moreover, the results highlight that communities' functional characteristics (i.e. plant height) mediate such a link, calling for new insights into the relation between S-Div and functional diversity."	43	1	0	0	23	0	45	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900003	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

NDVI is a surrogate for the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation This functional attribute has a short-time response to disturbances. is connected to ecosystem services and can be monitored through remote sensing. First, we provide a baseline description of the NDVI dynamics in the parks and analysed its temporal trends (1981-2003). Then. we evaluated the relationships of the seasonal dynamics and interannual trends with the climate conditions, vegetation types and conservation histories of the parks.Results: The parks showed two patterns of NDVI dynamics corresponding to Mediterranean and Eurosiberian regions. Most parks showed areas with positive NDVI trends that tended to have higher proportions of Mediterranean coniferous and mixed forests. oro-Mediterranean scrublands, healthlands. maquis and garrigues. Negative trends were scarce and associated with marshes and Alpine coniferous forests. The lack of a common response in all parks was related to their different environmental conditions. management. and conservation histories.Conclusions: National parks are changing in the short term but not uniformly.

Savanna woody vegetation classification - now in 3-D	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	17	1	NA	NA	172	184	NA	10.1111/avsc.12048	Article	JAN 2014	2014	"QuestionThe co-existence of woody plants and grasses characterize savannas, with the horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of trees creating a heterogeneous biotic environment. To understand the influence of biogeophysical drivers on the spatial patterns of 3-D structure of woody vegetation, these patterns need to be explained over large areas to capture the context. Is there a spatially explicit, ecologically meaningful way to capture the patterns and context of 3-D woody vegetation structure?LocationClassification development and testing sites: landscapes in Bushbuckridge Municipality, Sabi Sand Wildtuin and Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga province, north-east South Africa.MethodsThe aforementioned structural classification approach requires appropriate 3-D and spatially explicit remote sensing data. A LiDAR-based canopy height model (CHM) and volumetric pixel (voxel) data from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory Alpha system were used to create the structural classification. First, we segmented the CHM images using multi-threshold and multi-resolution image segmentation techniques, and classified the image segments into four height classes, namely shrub (1-3m), low tree (3-6m), high tree (6-10m) or tall tree (>10m). A hierarchical a priori approach was used to develop classification criteria. The following metrics were calculated for 0.25-ha grid cells based on the cover and spatial arrangement of the four height classes: canopy cover, sub-canopy cover, canopy layers, Simpson's diversity index and cohesion. Top of canopy vegetation was classified using each metric at the 0.25-ha scale, with canopy cover being the primary classification metric. Subsequently, individual layers identified within the canopy were classified using the voxel data. We use a code system for describing classes to ensure standardization between different regions; a more traditional naming system may be used in addition for interpretation.ConclusionThis system provides a more comprehensive classification of the horizontal and vertical structural diversity of savannas compared to the traditional vegetation classification systems. The description of multi-layers within the canopy should allow for a sensitive change detection method. The classification can be used in many current focus areas, including habitat suitability mapping for biodiversity conservation, strategic adaptive management and monitoring land-cover change."	13	0	0	0	8	0	17	2014-01-22	WOS:000328544400017	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We included high-resolution predictors derived from digital height models and from satellite spectral images. Coarser-scaled predictors characterizing climatic and topographic conditions were also included, as were soil properties and geology. We applied hierarchical partitioning to regression models to investigate the independent contribution of each predictor set to species richness models.Results: Predictors derived from high-resolution remote sensing data substantially improved the species richness models (increase 14-55% of R-2). However, coarse-scaled climatic and topographic predictors still explained a high proportion of the variance in the species richness data in all models, independently of other predictors commonly used. The importance of the remotely sensed variables was strongly dependent on the biogeographic region considered. The species richness models of smaller organisms of the forest floor (herbs and edaphic bryophytes) benefited greatly from adding high-resolution topographic predictors, indicating the importance of microtopographic heterogeneity for these groups. Both epiphytic lichens and herbs responded strongly to indicators of structural properties of the forest stand.Conclusions: High-resolution remote sensing data is a proxy for micro-environmental structures and variation in these structures. Our results show that predictors derived from such data can improve species richness models considerably, especially in regions with low climatic and/or topographic variation. High-resolution remote sensing variables excellently complement coarser-scaled predictors, as they are available over large areas at low cost."	33	2	0	0	27	0	41	2013-10-01	WOS:000324090800001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The underlying assumptions are that higher spectral variation in canopy reflectance (depending on scale) is caused by either (1) variation in habitats or linked vegetation types or plant communities with their specific optical community traits or (2) variation in the species themselves and their specific optical traits. Methods The SVH was examined in several empirical remote-sensing case studies, which often report some correlation between spectral variation and biodiversity-related variables (mostly plant species counts); however, the strength of the observed correlations varies between studies. In contrast, studies focussing on understanding the causal relationship between (plant) species counts and spectral variation remain scarce. Here, we discuss these causal relationships and support our perspectives through simulations and experimental data. Results We reveal that in many situations the spectral variation caused by species or functional traits is subtle in comparison to other factors such as seasonality and physiological status. Moreover, the degree of contrast in reflectance has little to do with the number but rather with the identity of the species or communities involved. Hence, spectral variability should not be expressed based on contrast but rather based on metrics expressing manifoldness. While we describe cases where a certain link between spectral variation and plant species diversity can be expected, we believe that as a scientific hypothesis (which suggests a general validity of this assumed relationship) the SVH is flawed and requires refinement. Conclusions To this end we call for more research examining the drivers of spectral variation in vegetation canopies and their link to plant species diversity and biodiversity in general. Such research will allow critically assessing under which conditions spectral variation is a useful indicator for biodiversity monitoring and how it could be integrated into monitoring networks."	75	1	0	0	44	0	77	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000010	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How do these data perform compared to full range imaging spectroscopy data? Which spectral and spatial characteristics of remote sensing data are important for accurate mapping of habitats and their variability?LocationA mire complex in Bavaria, southern Germany.MethodsTo compare the performance of imaging spectroscopy and multispectral remote sensing data, airborne spectroscopy data (AISA Dual) were spectrally and spatially resampled to the characteristics of two state-of-the-art multispectral sensors (RapidEye and Sentinel-2), resulting in three data sets with different spectral and spatial resolution. Based on the three data sets, we used a combination of field surveys, ordination techniques (non-metric multidimensional scaling), as well as regression and classification techniques (Random Forests) to derive maps of the distribution of Natura 2000 habitat types and their compositional variability. Subsequently, we analysed effects of the spatial and spectral image resolution and spectral coverage on the mapping performance.ResultsMire habitat types and their floristic composition could be accurately mapped with multispectral remote sensing data. In the case of accentuated floristic differences between habitats, the fits of the models for the three sensors differed only marginally. These effects and the importance of the spatial resolution are discussed.ConclusionsThe results are encouraging and confirm that multispectral data may allow the combined mapping of discrete habitats and their local variability.

To understand the causes of this variability, long-term monitoring of existing projects is critical, but this comes at considerable costs. Current literature counts several studies using time series of satellite images to assess vegetation responses to disturbances and landscape transformations. Yet such methods are seldom used in the restoration literature and in practice. This synthesis seeks to identify how common remote sensing approaches for the assessment of plant recovery could inform the monitoring and management of restored plant communities. Methods This paper reviews the methods and metrics used to detect trajectories (i.e., change through time) in plant properties from rich time series of aerial and satellite images following change drivers including fire, extreme climatic events, climate change, and pest outbreaks. Specifically, it reviews the sensors, vegetation properties, modeling approaches, and indicators that can help measure plant stress and response to interventions. Results and Conclusions Remote sensing methods commonly used in disturbance ecology and assessments of land-cover changes could inform the monitoring of restoration projects at low cost and over large spatio-temporal scales, thus bridging the gap between field surveys to rapidly identify stressors or unexpected vegetation responses. Potential applications include comparing sites to identify factors impacting their responses to restoration, assessing restoration success, and testing ecological hypotheses to guide future project planning and design."	6	0	0	0	2	0	7	2022-06-01	WOS:000799976900001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for individual species, but projects mapping multiple species are rarer. We compare maps of plant community composition assembled by stacking results from many SDMs with multivariate maps constructed using nearest-neighbor imputation.Location: Western Cascades ecoregion, Oregon and California, USA.Methods: We mapped distributions and abundances of 28 tree species over 4,007,110 ha at 30-m resolution using three approaches: SDMs using machine learning (random forest) to yield: (1) binary (RF_Bin); (2) basal area (abundance; RF_Abund) predictions; and (3) multi-species basal area predictions using a nearest-neighbor imputation variant based on random forest (RF_NN). We evaluated accuracy of binary predictions for all models, compared area mapped with plot-based areal estimates, assessed species abundance at two spatial scales and evaluated communities for species richness, problematic compositional errors and overall community composition.Results: RF_Bin yielded the strongest binary predictions (median True Skill Statistics; RF_Bin: 0.57, RF_NN: 0.38, RF_Abund: 0.27). Plot-scale predictions of abundance were poor for RF_Abund and RF_NN (median Agreement Coefficient (AC): -1.77 and -2.28), but strong when summarized over 50-km radius tessellated hexagons (median AC for both: 0.79). RF_Abund's strength with abundance and weakness with binary predictions stems from predicting small values instead of zeros. The number of zero value predictions from RF_NN was closest to counts of zeros in the plot data. Correspondingly, RF_NN's map-based species area estimates closely matched plot-based area estimates. RF_NN also performed best for community-level accuracy metrics.Conclusions: RF_NN was the best technique for building a broad-scale map of diversity and composition because the modelling framework maintained inter-species relationships from the input plot data. Re-assembling communities from single variable maps often yielded unrealistic communities. Although RF_NN rarely excelled at single species predictions of presence or abundance, it was often adequate to many (but not all) applications in both dimensions. We discuss our results in the context of map utility for applications in the fields of ecology, conservation and natural resource management planning. We highlight how RF_NN is well-suited for mapping current but not future vegetation."	37	2	0	0	30	1	46	2014-07-01	WOS:000337725300014	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A climate-based ecological model may provide an effective alternative to the traditional approach for assessing limitations, thresholds, and the potential distribution of forests. The main objective of this study is to develop such a model, with a machine-learning approach based on scale-free climate variable estimates and classified vegetation plots, to generate a fine-scale predicted vegetation map of Taiwan, a subtropical mountainous island.Location Taiwan.Methods A total of 3,824 plots from 13 climate-related forest types and 57 climatic variable estimates for each plot were used to build an individual ecological niche model for each forest type with random forest (RF). A predicted vegetation map was developed through the assemblage of RF predictions for each forest type at the spatial resolution of 100 m. The accuracy of the ensemble RF model was evaluated by comparing the predicted forest type with its original classification by plot.Results The climate environment of regions higher than 100 m above sea level in Taiwan was classified into potential habitats of 13 forest types by using model predictions. The predicted vegetation map displays a distinct altitudinal zonation from subalpine to montane cloud forests, followed by the latitudinal differentiation of subtropical mountain forests in the north and tropical montane forests in the south, with an average mismatch rate of 6.59%. An elevational profile and 3D visualization demonstrate the excellence of the model in estimating a fine, precise, and topographically corresponding potential distribution of forests.Conclusions The machine-learning approach is effective for handling a large number of variables and to provide accurate predictions.

After image pre-processing, supervised maximum likelihood classification was performed on the images and on all two-, three-, four- and five-date combinations. Relationships between tree species composition and canopy density were assessed using regression analyses.Results: The image with the greatest tree species discrimination was acquired on 27/10 when the overstorey species were in different stages of leaf tinting and fall. In this image, tree species were mapped with an overall classification accuracy (OCA) of 71% (kappa 0.63). A similar OCA was achieved from the other four images combined (OCA 72%, kappa 0.64). The highest classification accuracy was achieved by combining three images: 17 March, 16 July, 27 October. This achieved an OCA of 84% (kappa 0.79), increasing to 88% (kappa 0.85) after a post-classification clump and sieve procedure. Canopy height and percentage cover of oak explained 72% of variance in canopy density.Conclusions: The ability to discriminate and map temperate deciduous tree species in airborne multi-spectral imagery is increased using time-series data. An autumn image supplemented with an image from both the green-up and full-leaf phases was optimum. The derived tree species map provides a more powerful ecological tool for determining woodland structural/compositional relationships than field-based measures."	151	12	0	0	55	1	177	2010-02-01	WOS:000273601700008	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This heterogeneity often represents a severe problem for traditional mapping or ground survey techniques. The work presented here proposes to apply a very detailed CORINE land cover map as baseline information for plant community sampling and analysis in a coastal dune landscape.Location: Molise coast, Central Italy.Method: We analysed through an error matrix the coherence between land cover classes and vegetation types identified through a field survey. The CORINE land cover map (scale 1 :5000) of the Molise coast was used with the CORINE legend expanded to a fourth level of detail for natural and semi-natural areas. Vegetation data were collected following a random stratified sampling design using the CORINE land cover classes as strata. An error matrix was used to compare, on a category-by-category basis, the relationship between vegetation types (obtained by cluster analyses of sampling plots) and land cover classes of the same area.Results: The coincidence between both classification approaches is quite good. Only one land cover class shows a very weak agreement with its corresponding vegetation type; this result was interpreted as being related to human disturbance.Conclusions: Since it is based on a standard land cover classification, the proposal has a potential for application to most European coastal systems.

Instead of plant species or communities we used mean indicator values of vegetation records as response variables. To improve the differential power of indicator values for wetland habitat conditions, we calibrated these values using field data. Different methods were tested with our predictive models in three mires to see which calibration method is best in enhancing model performance. To assess the effect of the uneven distribution of vegetation records along environmental gradients. calibrations based on random and evenly distributed samples were compared. As a test of the predictive power of the models we used r(2) between ground truth and model prediction.This approach is illustrated through an application with nutrient indicator values in the mire La Burtigniere.Results: Model performances were not the same for the three mires. The predictive power was better for the nutrient values, soil reaction and humus values than for light and moisture values. 2000 records were sufficient as basis for re-calibration. Models based on original Landolt indicator values were overall the weakest compared with re-calibrated values. By comparing the predictive power of Models based on randomly or evenly selected records were about equally predictive.Conclusions: 1. A habitat-specific re-calibration of the Landolt indicator values enhances the predictive mapping of the Swiss mire ecosystems. 2. The re-calibration based on weighted averaging gives a better performance than the one based on Gaussian logistic regression. 3. The uneven distribution of indicator values due to the over-representation of mire habitats does not hamper model performance. 4. 2000 vegetation records are a sufficient basis for an optimal re-calibration of the vegetation types. An illustration of the method is given by using the soil fertility pattern of the mire La Burtigniere."	17	0	0	0	12	0	18	2007-08-01	WOS:000247766700004	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We produced a map showing 13 clearly differentiated land-cover types, and described the composition and structure of the plant communities, in an area of almost 40 000 km2 in central Argentina. The land-cover map obtained shows that the Chaco vegetation in central Argentina is highly disturbed. In the lowland part of the area the dominant land-cover types are largely cultural landscapes and substitute shrublands, which have displaced the original Chaco forests, leaving only small isolated remnants generally confined to sites with some kind of constrain for agriculture. The use of TM images and the multivariate analysis of phytosociological data showed a qualified, high accuracy mapping capability for land-cover types in the Chaco region (ca. 85% overall accuracy). Our results highlight the utility of TM and field data in a subtropical to warm-temperate region, which is promising where other ancillary data are not available and a rapid acquisition of reliable vegetation data is required, so constituting a starting point for an imperative and more extensive classification and mapping of the endangered Chaco region."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	2002-12-01	BCI:BCI200300249754	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Grid maps are used as a basic vegetation data base in Japan; they are simplified from vector-based vegetation maps. We estimated the frequency error or lack of information corresponding to reduced resolution and examined the reliable limits of this data base. We produced 10 grid maps on five different scales from 50 m to 1000 m using two different methods using both the whole cell (W-method) and only the central circle (C-method) from a vegetation map at scale 1: 25 000. We found that patches larger than the area of a cell on a vector-based map could be kept almost certainly on any map, but many patches of less than the cell size were lost. The number of missing patches with the C-method is fewer at every scale than those with the W-method. Though the value of Morisita's C ? (p) index showed that the similarity with the original map was high - from the 50-m to the 200-m resolution - it was increasingly lower on the 400-m and 1000-m grid maps. The values of the Shannon index on the original map, 50-m and 100-m grid maps were not different, but they decreased from the 200-m to 1000-m grid maps. Because the vegetation data base of the Japanese Environment Agency used a 1000-m C-method grid map, we found that much information on patches less than 100 ha had disappeared. Information about dominant vegetation or large patches is almost accurate in this data base."	9	1	0	0	4	0	11	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900007	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We employed gradient analysis by means of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) as a prediction tool and image segmentation as a filter for reducing the number of incorrect predictions. Topographical variables reflecting relief properties at different scales were used as surrogates for environmental conditions in combination with spectral band values from infrared orthophotographs. Coupling topographic correlation using CCA and image analysis proved practicable to map the distribution of alpine plant communities. Although plant communities often showed similar spectral response, they were mapped according to their specific topographical niches. Generally, topographic variables, indicative of environmental gradients controlling plant distribution, provided this information in most cases. The importance of spectral vs topographic variables varied among plant communities. Whereas the correlation between topography and plant species distribution was particularly significant for mapping alpine grasslands, spectral texture measures proved to be of major importance in discriminating between pioneer communities. Post-processing by image segmentation improved overall accuracy by 12%. A total of 17 plant communities and their mosaics were mapped, with an overall accuracy of 69.4% and a x value of 0.64.

The area is characterized by V-shaped river valleys deeply incised into a gently undulating landscape. Five stages of phenological development were defined, based upon phenological spectra of plant communities in late April 96 sites, more or less regularly spaced over the area, were assigned to one of these stages using field observations of these spectra. Potential direct solar irradiation was calculated from a digital elevation model for a 25 m x 25 m grid extending over the study area. A method was developed for interpolation of phenological observations by weighted regression of phenology on the irradiation model. This interpolation enables the prediction of the local stage of phenological development across the study area without levelling out phenological patterns dependent upon small-scale topographic variation. Spring phenological events appear to be more advanced in the valleys (except for steep north-facing slopes) than in the adjacent landscape. Possible climatic processes underlying this pattern are discussed with emphasis on temperature inversions in the river valleys. Cold-air-drainage inversions reported from the valleys are probably too infrequent and of too short duration to delay plant phenology. The combined effects of advanced phenology and the increased risk of spring frost injury due to these inversions in the valleys may be an explanation for local distributional patterns of flora and vegetation."	17	0	0	0	9	0	17	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900008	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Experimental studies testing the influence of site, mapping scale, and differences in experience level on inconsistency in field-based ecosystem mapping are lacking. Here, we study how inconsistencies in field-based ecosystem maps depend on these factors.Location: Iskoras and Guollemuorsuolu, northeastern Norway, and Landsvik and Lygra, western Norway.Methods: In a balanced experiment, four sites were field-mapped wall-to-wall to scales 1:5000 and 1:20,000 by 12 mappers, representing three experience levels. Thematic inconsistency was calculated by overlay analysis of map pairs from the same site, mapped to the same scale. We tested for significant differences between sites, scales, and experience-level groups. Principal components analysis was used in an analysis of additional map inconsistencies and their relationships with site, scale and differences in experience level and time consumption were analysed with redundancy analysis.Results: On average, thematic inconsistency was 51%. The most important predictor for thematic inconsistency, and for all map inconsistencies, was site. Scale and its interaction with site predicted map inconsistencies, but only the latter were important for thematic inconsistency. The only experience-level group that differed significantly from the mean thematic inconsistency was that of the most experienced mappers, with nine percentage points. Experience had no significant effect on map inconsistency as a whole.Conclusion: Thematic inconsistency was high for all but the dominant thematic units, with potentially adverse consequences for mapping ecosystems that are fragmented or have low coverage. Interactions between site and mapping system properties are considered the main reasons why no relationships between scale and thematic inconsistency were observed. More controlled experiments are needed to quantify the effect of other factors on inconsistency in field-based mapping."	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2023-08-21	WOS:000938291400001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Disturbance is a prime driver of succession in most of the boreal zone, producing landscape diversity characterized by a large-scale vegetation mosaic of early to late succession states. When mapping the circumboreal vegetation, spatial extent, time involved from disturbance to recovered condition and likelihood of interacting disturbance types are crucial for how current vegetation is interpreted and subsequently included as map characteristics. In this paper we present examples from the boreal zone where natural and/or anthropogenic disturbance regimes dominate the state and distribution of vegetation, and possibilities for assessing the nature and extent of the disturbed regions using remotely sensed data.Conclusion: Disturbed vegetation occupies large areas in the boreal zone and related vegetation successions should be adequately represented when mapping the zone. In regions where the 'potential natural vegetation' is a hypothetical reconstruction from remnants of 'natural' vegetation it would be preferable to use the concept of 'actual real vegetation' for which remote sensing at coarse, medium and fine resolution is an efficient tool.

The rank and magnitude of differences indicated that ribbons at Flattop and Park Range are more similar to each other than to those at Medicine Bow. Flattop ribbons were also more elongated, narrower and less variable than those at Park Range, suggesting differences in the type and strength of structural control. Previous research showed that Flattop ribbons occupy regular lithologic ridges, while our observations of ribbons and analysis of geologic maps suggests weaker and less consistent microtopographic control at Park Range, and dominant wind-snowdrift interactions with little to no microtopographic influence at Medicine Bow.Conclusions: Landscape metrics indicate differences in pattern among sites that reflect differences in dominant factors influencing ribbon forest development and maintenance.

Here, we assessed, for the first time, the potential use of remotely sensed descriptors of water and carbon cycles derived from Copernicus Sentinel 2 images for fine-scale habitat characterization and mapping of narrow endemic serpentine-tolerant species.LocationWe focused on three endemic species with a very limited distribution in the Serra de Careon ultramafic outcrop, a regional plant biodiversity hotspot in Spain.MethodsWe developed SDMs based solely on remotely sensed descriptors of plant water content and habitat dynamics estimated from multitemporal Sentinel 2 images.ResultsThe predictive capacity of the models was very high (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) > 0.9, sensitivity > 90 and specificity > 84), even for projections beyond the range of data used for calibration (AUC > 0.8, sensitivity > 77 and specificity > 81). Overall, the suitable habitat areas predicted by the models were similar for all three species (Schoener's D metric > 0.7). The annual mean and coefficient of variation of the Normalized Difference of Water Index provided a good representation of the hydromorphic soils with serpentine clay minerals and characterized by the formation of temporary pools during winter months. The annual mean and coefficient of variation of the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index were also important predictors owing to their capacity to capture the serpentine habitat conditions, characterized by open vegetation and highly exposed soil.ConclusionsThese findings confirm the potential of ecosystem functioning descriptors derived from spectral Sentinel 2 indices as a cost-effective means of characterizing the ecological niche of endemic plant species in serpentine habitats and as a promising tool to support their conservation and monitoring."	4	0	0	0	2	0	4	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800004	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Predictive mapping of vegetation using models linking vegetation units to mapped environmental variables has been advocated for remote areas. In this study, three different types of model were employed (within a GIS) to produce vegetation maps of the Hamersley Ranges region of Western Australia. The models were: (1) decision trees; (2) statistical models; and (3) heuristic/conceptual models. Maps were produced for three different levels of a floristic classification, i.e. 16 communities in two community groups with eight subgroups. All models satisfactorily established relationships between the vegetation units and available predictor variables, except where the number of sites of a particular unit was small. The different models often made similar predictions, especially for more widespread vegetation units. Map accuracy (as determined by field testing of maps) improved with increasing level of abstraction, with plant community maps ca. 50 % correct, subgroup maps ca. 60 % correct and group maps 90 % correct. Map inaccuracies were due to several factors, including low sample numbers producing unrepresentative models, poor resolution of and errors in available maps of predictor variables, and available predictor variables not being able to differentiate between certain vegetation units, particularly at the plant community level. Of these factors, poor resolution of maps was seen as the most critical. One type of model could not be recommended over another; however the choice of model will be largely dependent on the nature of the data set and the type of map coverage required."	9	0	0	0	5	1	9	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900004	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To this end, we develop and evaluate the mapping method of hierarchical object-based classification with a rule-based expert system. Location: San Clemente Island, California, USA. Methods: We developed and tested an approach based on hierarchical object-based classification with a rule-based expert system to effectively map vegetation communities on SCI following the Manual of California Vegetation classification system. In this mapping approach, the shrub species defining each vegetation community and non-shrub growth forms were first mapped using aerial imagery and lidar data, then used as input in an automated mapping rule set that incorporates the percent cover rules of a field-based mapping rule set. Results: The final vegetation map portrays the distribution of 19 vegetation communities across SCI, with the largest areas comprised of California Annual and Perennial Grassland (35%) and three types of coastal sage scrub and maritime succulent scrub, comprising a combined 53% of the area. Map accuracy was assessed to be 79% based on fuzzy methods and 61% with a traditional accuracy assessment. The accuracy of tree identification was assessed to be 81%, but species-level tree accuracy was 45%. Conclusions: Semi-automated approaches to vegetation community mapping can produce repeatable maps over large spatial extents that facilitate ecological management efforts. However, some low-statured shrub community types were difficult to differentiate due to patchy canopies of co-occurring species including abundant non-native grasses characteristic of complex disturbance histories. Species-level tree mapping accuracy was low due to the difficulty of identifying species within poorly illuminated canyons, resulting from sub-optimal image acquisition timing."	6	0	0	0	5	0	6	2019-12-27	WOS:000502572000001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Image analyses are often coupled with semi-automated or automated workflows to reduce the amount of human labor input compared with traditional manual procedures. This study aims to evaluate and compare different image segmentation methods for plant cover analysis using digital RGB and thermal images, focusing on the effectiveness of semi-automated and manual segmentation techniques in monitoring plant cover on green roofs. Location: An Extensive green roof in the City of Toronto. Methods: We surveyed the plant cover of an extensive green roof using digital and thermal imagery. The plant cover values were obtained using three methods: traditional manual segmentation based on a visual examination (MS), ImageJ Color Threshold (CT) and Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS), all performed within FIJI (a distribution of ImageJ). Manual segmentation based on visual examination was used as a reference standard. Results: Significant correlation was found between the cover estimation using the CT and TWS methods relative to MS, and between cover estimation using the thermal image and the RGB image. TWS overestimated plant cover on thermal images while producing an underestimation on RGB images. CT demonstrated a performance closer to MS than TWS, indicating that manually customized methods produced results more aligned with MS. The estimated cover values by MS were not significantly affected by the image type (digital RGB or thermal). Conclusions: Results suggest that RGB and thermal imaging techniques may provide complementary results and reveal unique information regarding the functioning of green roofs. The accuracy of supervised machine-learning methods could be enhanced with site-specific data to provide a more accurate and efficient estimation of plant cover, which might be beneficial for long-term studies on green roofs and ecological sites in remote locations."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2024-06-25	WOS:001249567400001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We ask: (i) is it possible to differentiate shrub species with a unique growth form by their reflectance signature; (ii) which of the tested multispectral sensors produces the best separation; and (iii) how are the results affected by the timing of data acquisition in the vegetation period?Location: Kazbegi district, Central Greater Caucasus, Georgia.Method: We analysed three shrub (Betula litwinowii, Rhododendron caucasicum, Hippophae rhamnoides) and one tall forb (Veratrum lobelianum) species occurring in the sub-alpine to alpine belt The vegetation of 52 releves was analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling and indicator species analysis. From field spectrometric data we simulated multispectral sensor bands (IKONOS, Quickbird 2, RapidEye, WorldView-2) directly taken from the target species. We analysed the reflectance signature in RapidEye data from June and September. For all data sets we calculated the Jeffries-Matusita distance (JMD) as a separation measure and tested the reflectance signature of the single bands for differences.Results: Betula litwinowii and V. lobelianum always co-occurred in our data. A high abundance of B. litwinowii could also be found in the Rhododendron cluster and vice versa, whereas the Hippophae cluster was more homogeneous. Simulated bands showed good overall separation (JMD 1.58-2.00) of the target species. The separation increased with the increase of number of bands and inclusion of the red edge band. There was a general trend in which the reflectance from satellite images produced a lower separation (JMD 1.20-1.55) than the simulations, with the best separation in the late vegetation period.Conclusion: Our results showed the possibility to spectrally separate encroaching shrub species with a unique growth form in a high-mountain environment using simulated multispectral data and satellite imagery."	9	0	0	0	4	0	11	2016-06-01	WOS:000374545600014	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A map of the potential natural vegetation of Ireland with an outline description of the vegetation units is presented. The vegetation of Ireland has a distinctive and highly oceanic character as a result of its location on the northwestern extremity of the Eurasian landmass and its recent geological and vegetation history. Forests would naturally cover the greater part of the island but the long history of forest decline over the last 6000 yr, due to clearance by man and paludification, has led to the present situation where native forest cover is less than 1 % of the land area. Together with intensive land use, drainage, peat cutting and the introduction of alien species, this presents considerable difficulties in the construction of mapping units. The map, which has been compiled as part of the Vegetation Map of Europe at a scale of 1 : 2.5 million, contains 20 mapping units. They comprise: nine forests, i.e. montane birch forests (one unit), acidophilous oak forests (two units), forests of oak or oak and ash with hazel on mostly base-rich soils (four units), forests on alluvium and gleyed clays (one unit each); five mire types, i.e. blanket mires (two units), raised bogs (one unit), sedge mires (one unit), degraded raised bogs (one unit); and six minor units viz. heaths (two units), sand dunes (two units), salt marshes (one unit) and polders (one unit). As a result of human activity, the potential natural vegetation, especially the forests, will differ considerably from the former natural climax vegetation."	17	1	0	0	18	0	24	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900010	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Can UAS images be used to (1) produce vegetation maps at the species level; and (2) estimate species abundance?Location: One river and two lake test sites in northern Sweden, middle boreal sub-zone.Methods: At one lake and at the river site we evaluated accuracy with which aquatic plant species can be identified on printouts of UAS images (scale 1:800, resolution 5.6 cm). As assessment units we used homogeneous vegetation patches, referred to as vegetation stands of one or more species. The accuracy assessment included calibration and validation based on field controls. At the river site, we produced a digital vegetation map based on an UAS orthoimage (geometrically corrected image mosaic) and the results of the species identification evaluation. We applied visual image interpretation and manual mapping. At one of the lake sites, we assessed the abundance (four-grade scale) of the dominating Phragmites australis and produced a cover map.Results: We identified the species composition of vegetation stands at the lake and the river site with an overall accuracy of 95.1% and 80.4%, respectively. It was feasible to produce a digital vegetation map, albeit with a slight reduction in detail compared to the species identification step.

Trees are a driving force behind miombo dynamics, thus, spatially explicit metrics of tree cover are essential for evaluating habitat characteristics, resource availability, and environmental change. We developed predictive models and maps of tree species diversity and biomass within a previously undescribed landscape.LocationMahale Mountains National Park (MMNP), Greater Mahale Ecosystem (GME), Tanzania.MethodsWe created models of tree density, basal area, tree species richness, and tree diversity according to the Shannon Diversity Index. We created a predictive model using an ensemble modeling approach using plot-based data from MMNP and predictor variables derived from satellite data associated with climate, habitat structure, plant productivity, and topography. We assessed predictor importance across models and produced maps based on model predictions and compared them to land cover type and protective status.ResultsResults revealed strong positive correlations between tree metrics (r >= 0.70) and substantial overlap in the selection and relative importance of predictors. Canopy height was the most important predictor across models, followed by climate and topography predictors associated with energy. Predictors derived from the soil-adjusted vegetation index were also valuable. Model performances ranged from R2 values of 0.45 to 0.55, with tree density performing best. Maps show high tree species diversity and biomass in protected areas.ConclusionsThis study and the maps it produced provide a baseline for land management and future modeling efforts in the GME. Our results highlight the contribution of a wide variety of environmental predictors and the importance of a select few. We confirmed the importance of the current protected area network where conservation efforts align, and help sustain, an abundance and diversity of trees.

Can we develop credible near-term forecasts from climate data that can be used to prepare for future climate change effects on vegetation?Location: Semi-arid grasslands in Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, USA.Methods: We built vegetation response models by relating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from MODIS imagery in Mar-Nov 2000-2013 to antecedent climate and water balance variables preceding the monthly NDVI observations. We compared how climate and water balance variables explained vegetation greenness and then used a multi-model ensemble of climate and water balance models to forecast monthly NDVI for three holdout years.Results: Water balance variables explained vegetation greenness to a greater degree than climate variables for most growing season months. Seasonally important variables included measures of antecedent water input and storage in spring, switching to indicators of drought, input or use in summer, followed by antecedent moisture availability in autumn. In spite of similar climates, there was evidence the grazed grassland showed a response to drying conditions 1 mo sooner than the ungrazed grassland. Lead times were generally short early in the growing season and antecedent window durations increased from 3 mo early in the growing season to 1 yr or more as the growing season progressed. Forecast accuracy for three holdout years using a multi-model ensemble of climate and water balance variables outperformed forecasts made with a naive NDVI climatology.Conclusions: We determined the influence of climate and water balance on vegetation at a fine temporal scale, which presents an opportunity to forecast vegetation response with short lead times. This understanding was obtained through high-frequency vegetation monitoring using remote sensing, which reduces the costs and time necessary for field measurements and can lead to more rapid detection of vegetation changes that could help managers take appropriate actions."	15	0	0	0	12	1	16	2016-10-26	WOS:000384751300006	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

An extended climate niche for North America's Coastal Douglas-fir (CDF) forest zone is determined and projected to evaluate its potential distribution under a changing climate and to identify climate refugia for conservation planning.Location: Pacific Northwest temperate rain forest in British Columbia (BC), CA, and nearby Washington (WA) and Oregon (OR), US.Methods: Using a combination of ecosystem polygon mapping and ecological plot data with climate interpolation tools, forests characterized as CDF under BC's biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification system were identified in the neighbouring US. Current (baseline) limits to CDF distribution were identified and used to map its potential distribution and climate refugia under future climate conditions using ensemble Global Climate Model projections.Results: The extended CDF climate niche covers 76 725 km(2) under baseline conditions, with the majority of the area in the Pacific Northwest US. The extended CDF forest zone includes a vegetation assemblage consistent with existing definitions of BC's CDF; moist maritime subzone, but also an additional vegetation assemblage representing a drier maritime subzone. Projections of future climate suggest a northerly shift (similar to 150 km) and a decrease (-91.5%) in overall CDF area. Climate refugia are projected for discontinuous patches of CDF forest on Vancouver Island and adjacent mainland.Conclusions: This project combined georeferenced ecological plot data and digital maps, thereby facilitating the international mapping of ecosystem distributions in adjacent administrative areas that do not currently use the same ecosystem classification and snapping systems. This approach and the concept of climate niche definition, distribution and persistence are applicable to the management, restoration and conservation of plant communities, particularly in evaluating future ecosystem range shifts and disruptions associated with a changing climate. The potential for dramatic reductions in the range of the Coastal Douglas-fir zone, with persistence in <15% of its current area, suggest that most of the extended CDF zone is marginally suitable for the characteristic CDF ecosystems and that slight shifts in climate or disturbance regime Essay greatly alter the character of the vegetation.The full climatic niche for British Columbia's Coastal Douglas-fir forest zone is determined from its mapped distribution and georeferenced plot data in the neighbouring USA. A new subzone is characterized, and the potential distribution of the extended zone is projected under a changing climate to identity climate refugia. For sensitive ecosystems with multi-jurisdictional distributions, this approach helps focus conservation efforts."	5	0	0	0	4	0	6	2015-04-29	WOS:000352131500018	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

(2) How has aspen distribution changed in southwestern Idaho? (3) Are topographic variables and conifer encroachment correlated with aspen changes?Location: Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in southwestern Idaho, USA.Methods: Multi-temporal Landsat 5 TM and lidar data were used individually and fused together. The best classification model was compared with a 1965 aspen map and tree ring data. Conifer encroachment was examined via image-based change detection and field mapping. Lidar-derived topographic variables were correlated with aspen change patterns using quantile regression models.Results: The best Landsat 5 TM classification was a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based approach with 92% overall accuracy. The lidar classification of tree presence/absence performed with 100% overall accuracy. Fusing the lidar classification with various Landsat 5 TM classifications improved overall accuracies 3 to 6%. Among the fusion models, the NDVI-lidar fusion performed best with 96% overall accuracy. Change detection indicated 69% decline in aspen cover, but 179% increase in aspen cover in other areas of the watershed. Conifers have completely replaced 17% of the aspen, while 93% of the remaining aspen stands have young Douglas-fir and western juniper trees underneath the aspen canopy. Aspen significantly decreased (P-values < 0.05) with increasing elevation (up to 2150 m) and decreasing slope.Conclusions: Landsat 5 TM data used with a NDVI-based approach provide an accurate method to classify aspen distribution. Landsat 5 TM classifications can be further improved via fusion with lidar data. Aspen change patterns are spatially variable: while aspen is drastically declining in some parts of this watershed, aspen is increasing in other areas."	10	0	0	0	7	0	11	2012-02-01	WOS:000299207600009	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The concept of mapping potential replacement vegetation (PRV) is proposed as a parallel to potential natural vegetation (PNV). Potential replacement vegetation (PRV) is an abstract and hypothetical vegetation which is in balance with climatic and soil factors currently affecting a given habitat, with environmental factors influencing the habitat from outside such as air pollution, and with an abstract anthropogenic influence (management) of given type, frequency and intensity. For every habitat, there is a series of possible PRV-types corresponding to the different anthropogenic influences, e.g. grazing, mowing, trampling or growing cereals. The PRV-concept is especially useful in large-scale mapping (scales > 1 : 25 000) of small areas where replacement vegetation is the focus of attention for managers and land-use planners, for example in nature reserves where the aim is conservation of replacement vegetation managed in a traditional way, or in restoration ecology where the concept may be used for defining restoration goals and evaluating the success of restoration efforts. At smaller scales, PRV-mapping may be useful for revealing the biogeographical patterns of larger areas which may be different from the corresponding PNV patterns, because replacement vegetation and natural vegetation may respond to environmental gradients at different scales. An example of medium-scale PRV-mapping through the coincidence of diagnostic species of vegetation types, based on species distribution grid data, is presented. In cultural landscapes, the advantage of using the PRV-concept instead of PNV is its direct relationship to the replacement vegetation. In the habitat mapping with respect to the replacement vegetation, the PRV concept yields more valuable results than the mapping of actual vegetation, as the latter is strongly affected by spatially variable anthropogenic influences which may be largely independent from climatic and soil factors."	36	1	0	0	27	0	47	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900003	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, straightforward analysis of areas with high species turnover rates may result in a loss of information since a high level of generalization is required. In this study, we investigate whether analysis of more homogeneous subsets, in contrast to processing of the complete dataset, is a viable approach to mapping multiple floristic gradients. Location The coastal nature reserve Zwin (Belgium). Methods The measured dataset is partitioned into more homogeneous subsets based upon species composition using hierarchical classification. The dataset and subsets are then processed separately. First, ordination is performed to extract floristic gradients in plant species composition; second, these gradients are related to airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data through regression models and mapped by projecting these models on image data. Regression validation and Mantel tests are used to compare the results within the study and to other studies. Results Hierarchical classification resulted in two homogeneous vegetation subsets. Ordination yielded four gradients in the area and all regression models compared favorably to similar studies in other areas with R-2 values ranging from 0.47 to 0.74. The Mantel test showed that by dividing the dataset into subsets, higher resemblance to the original vegetation data can be achieved. Conclusion We showed that mapping gradual transitions in plant species composition across multiple subsets sampled from one measured vegetation dataset is a promising approach for retrospective analysis of areas with high species turnover rates. In addition to potential improvements in performance, this complementary analysis enables mapping of additional gradients, suggesting that all conventionally predicted maps remain available, valuable, and necessary for thorough understanding of plant species composition."	5	0	0	0	4	0	5	2019-08-08	WOS:000477498600001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A technique for fine-scale vegetation mapping with the aid of low-altitude aerial photography was developed. The procedure is as follows: 1. The site is divided into a lattice pattern - in case the site is too large to fit into a single photograph with satisfactory resolution. The coordinates of every lattice point are surveyed to be used as control points for geometric correction. A photograph of each block of the lattice is taken using a remote-controlled camera system lifted by a captive helium balloon. 2. The vegetation is classified on the basis of a phytosociological survey. 3. The shapes and locations of vegetation patches appearing in the photographs are entered into a computer, using a digitizer. A geometric correction is carried out through coordinate transformation referring to the coordinates of the control points and subsequently a draft vegetation map is produced. Finally, discrepancies are corrected and the map is coloured to produce the final version of the vegetation map. This technique was applied to vegetation mapping at a bar, 500 m wide and 2 km long, in the river Yoshino in Shikoku, Japan. A fine-scale vegetation map was obtained and used to analyse the influence of plants on geomorphic processes and community-specific hydrogeomorphic conditions on the bar."	10	0	0	0	5	0	13	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900006	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We subsequently quantified the explanatory power of S2 and LiDAR variables representing beta-diversity via the Mantel test, variation partitioning and multivariate analysis of variance. We also investigated the sensitivity of results to grain size of remote sensing data (20, 40, 60 m). Results The beta-diversity between the succulent and pine community is high, whereas the beta-diversity between the pine and subalpine community is low. In the wet season, up to 85% of beta-diversity is reflected by remote sensing variables. The S2 variables account for more explanatory power than the LiDAR variables. The explanatory power of LiDAR variables increases with grain size, whereas the explanatory power of S2 variables decreases. Conclusion At the lower ecotone, beta-diversity agrees with the pre-defined community distinction, while at the upper ecotone the community types cannot be clearly separated by compositional dissimilarity alone. The high beta-diversity between the succulent scrub and pine forest results from positive feedback switches of P. canariensis, being a fire-adapted, key tree species. In accordance with the spectral variation hypothesis, remote sensing signals can adequately represent beta-diversity for a large extent, in a short time and at low cost. However, in-situ sampling is necessary to fully understand community composition. Nature conservation requires such interdisciplinary approaches."	28	3	0	0	19	0	30	2019-01-01	WOS:000459825800003	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Where are priority areas for conservation located?LocationAl Jabal al Akhdar, Sultanate of Oman.MethodsA Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) was used to model the presence/absence of seven rangeland communities and agricultural areas based on seven selected environmental predictor variables. The latter were either obtained from existing digital datasets or derived from a digital elevation model and satellite images, whereas the grazing intensity was spatially modelled with the kernel density estimation technique. The resulting decision rules of a CTA were applied for predictive mapping within the study area (400 km2, resolution of 5 m) by means of ENVI's decision tree classifier. Plant communities of natural rangelands were subsequently evaluated to determine priority areas for nature conservation.ResultsAltitude, grazing intensity and landform revealed the highest predictive power. Most of the rangelands were predicted as Sideroxylon-Oleetum. The overall classification accuracy was 89%, whereby agricultural areas and the Ziziphus spina-christi-Nerium oleander community at wadi sites had no misclassification. Inaccuracies occurred mainly because of low sample numbers and errors in available maps of predictor variables. The highest rank for nature conservation was observed for the Teucrio-Juniperetum occupying 20% of the study area.ConclusionsVegetation mapping using CTA is a valuable tool for rangeland monitoring and identification of key representative areas for nature conservation.

Location: Cantabrian region, northern Spain. Methods: We mapped the riparian forests at a physiognomic and phytosociological level by delimiting riparian zones and generating vegetation distribution models based on remote sensing data (Landsat 8 OLI and LiDAR PNOA). We built virtual watersheds to define a spatial framework where the catchment environmental information can be specified for each river reach, in combination with the vegetation map. In order to determine the drivers that play a significant role in the observed spatial patterns in riparian forests, based on our data sets we modelled interactions between environmental information and riparian vegetation by using the Random Forest algorithm. Results: The modelling results obtained reliably reproduced the variation of riparian forest structure and composition across Cantabrian watersheds. The produced maps were highly accurate, with a more than 70% overall accuracy for forest occurrence. A clear differentiation between Eurosiberian (habitats 91E0 and 9160) and Mediterranean (92E0) riparian forests was shown on both sides of the mountain range. Topography and land use were the main drivers defining the distribution of riparian forest as a physiognomic unit. In turn, altitude, climate and percentage of pasture were the most relevant factors determining their composition (phytosociological approach). Conclusions: Our study confirms that anthropic control ultimately defines the distribution of vegetation in the riparian area at a regional to local scale. Human disturbances constrain the extension of forest patches across their potential distribution defined by topoclimatic boundaries, which establish a clear limit between Mediterranean and Eurosiberian biogeographical regions."	10	0	0	0	8	0	11	2019-11-19	WOS:000494681700005	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is a three-dimensional (3D) woody vegetation structural classification applied to LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data better than a 2D analysis to investigate change in fine-scale woody vegetation structure over 2yrs in a protected area (PA) and a communal rangeland (CR)?LocationBushbuckridge Municipality and Sabi Sand Wildtuin, NE South Africa.MethodsAirborne LiDAR data were collected over 3300ha in April 2008 and 2010. Individual tree canopies were identified using object-based image analysis and classified into four height classes: 1-3, 3-6, 6-10 and >10m. Four structural metrics were calculated for 0.25-ha grid cells: canopy cover, number of canopy layers present, cohesion and number of height classes present. The relationship between top-of-canopy cover and sub-canopy cover was investigated using regression. Gains, losses and persistence (GLP) of cover at each height class and the four structural metrics were calculated. GLP of clusters of each structural metric (calculated using LISA - Local Indicators of Spatial Association - statistics) were used to assess the changes in clusters of each metric over time.ResultsTop-of-canopy cover was not a good predictor of sub-canopy cover. The number of canopy layers present and cohesion showed gains and losses with persistence in canopy cover over time, necessitating the use of a 3D classification to detect fine-scale changes, especially in structurally heterogeneous savannas. Trees >3m in height showed recruitment and gains up to 2.2 times higher in the CR where they are likely to be protected for cultural reasons, but losses of up to 3.2-fold more in the PA, possibly due to treefall caused by elephant and/or fire.ConclusionLand use has affected sub-canopy structure in the adjacent sites, with the low intensity use CR showing higher structural diversity. A 3D classification approach was successful in detecting fine-scale, short-term changes between land uses, and can thus be used as a monitoring tool for savanna woody vegetation structure."	8	0	0	0	6	0	9	2015-07-02	WOS:000356007400017	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Can we use LandSat 5TM to model those vegetation communities across a mountain range to guide conservation and management plans? Location The Cascade Mountains of Washington, USA. Methods We surveyed vegetation across previously undocumented home ranges of mountain goats, which we determined via GPS telemetry and tracking. We used non-hierarchical cluster analysis to identify vegetation communities found therein. We linked the results of the fieldwork to a supervised classification of three LandSat 5TM (bands 2: 0.520.60 mu m, 3: 0.630.69 and 4: 0.760.90 mu m) images acquired consecutively on 29 July 2005 and to aerial imagery with 1-m resolution from the National Agriculture Inventory Program (NAIP) to create a map of vegetation communities across the Cascade Mountain range. Finally, we evaluated the success of the classification accuracy after transforming categorical land cover into percentage cover classes at a resolution that matches the positional error of the GPS telemetry collars. Results Field reconnaissance and analysis identified eight vegetation communities across mountain goat home ranges: montane forest, sub-alpine forest, heather, huckleberry, east-side shrub, sparse meadow, dense meadow and cryptogram (talus). Analysis of imagery linked the vegetation communities found on mountain goat ranges to specific thematic classes and projected the classification across the entire range. We identified a scale of analysis (ca. 2 ha) that achieved balance between bias and precision resulting in an accuracy of ca. 80% based on comparison with 1-m digital aerial imagery and survey results.

This paper presents a comparison of two alternative methods to describe and map vegetation: on the basis of plant species and growth forms, respectively. A stratified random sampling was taken from spontaneous vegetation in 1989 on the volcanic island of Pantelleria (near Sicily, Italy). Cartographic and other comparisons of the results from classification and ordination analysis suggest that the major differences were associated with differences in the time scale of the underlying processes. Species results (leading to floristic vegetation units) were representative of longer-term processes, growth-form results (leading to structural vegetation units) with shorter-term processes. Further implications of these results are discussed."	5	0	0	0	5	1	5	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900005	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Supervised mapping with machine learning demands high-quality reference data that field surveys alone cannot provide. This study evaluates drone-based procedures for phytosociological data collection, comparing them with field surveys. The research questions are as follows: Are species abundance data collected via drone surveys consistent with those obtained through traditional field phytosociological methods? Can plots be correctly assigned to known plant communities using drone data? LocationMarche, Central Italy. MethodsDrone surveys were conducted over forest and grassland plots using tailored imaging protocols. Forest plots were captured at 14 m with 11 high-zoom images per plot, while grasslands were surveyed at 5 m with seven images per plot. The images were analysed to identify plant species and estimate their abundances, generating plot x species matrices. Multivariate analyses, including PCA, Mantel tests and supervised k-means classification, were used to compare drone data with those obtained from the field traditional method. ResultsPCA and Mantel test results (r = 0.782, p < 0.001) demonstrated a strong relationship between species abundance data collected by drone and traditional field methods in both forest and grassland. The supervised classification achieved an overall accuracy exceeding 90% in assigning drone-surveyed plots to predefined plant associations. ConclusionsThis study introduces the proposal of standardised drone procedures to assist botanists in collecting phytosociological data in sub-Mediterranean grasslands and forests. They can effectively complement and enhance the traditional Braun-Blanquet method, broadening its scope and efficiently performing tasks such as vegetation unit assignment and creating reference data useful for the continuous production of supervised phytosociological maps of vegetation and habitats, which are essential for environmental monitoring."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-06-22	WOS:001510897200001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The model was parameterized from published information, but we had to assume fixed values of soil water storage capacity at 200 mm and soil fertility at 70% of maximum across the region. Field estimates of site index for the five dominant species were derived from published correlations with detailed mapping of vegetation provided by The British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range.Results: The site indices projected with the 3-PG model for the five species combined, when compared with those produced by the Ministry of Forests and Range, produced an r(2) averaging similar to 0.5 with a standard error of 2.8 m at 50 yr, equivalent to 10% of the mean.

One area was used for model training, the other for model projection. Maximum entropy models were run for six vegetation types, two from each of the ecosystems present in the area: forest, wetland and mountain heath-and shrublands. For each ecosystem, one locally abundant and one locally rare vegetation type were tested. AUC, the area under the receiver operating curve, was used as the model selection criterion. Environmental variables (n = 9) were selected through a backwards selection scheme, and model complexity was kept low. The models were evaluated using independent data.Results: Distribution modelling of vegetation types by local projection gave high AUC values, and the results were supported by the evaluation using independent data. The modelling ability was not affected by ecosystem differences. A negative relationship between the number of points used to train the models and the AUC value before evaluation suggests that models for locally rare vegetation types had better predictive performance than the models for abundant types.

The relationship between the canopy N:P ratio and forest structure was investigated through analysis of LiDAR data. The impact of temporal variation on canopy N:P ratio and the different spatial resolution of IS data on prediction accuracy for canopy N:P was addressed.

The recorded presence and absence of 15 native tree species were next mapped at 1 km resolution from data acquired on 22 771 field survey plots. To establish seasonal limits on photosynthesis and water use, a process-based growth model (3-PG, Physiological Processes to Predict Growth) was parameterized for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), one of the most widely distributed species in the region. Automated decision tree analyses were used to predict the distribution of different species by creating a suite of rules associated with the relative constraints that soil drought, atmospheric humidity deficits, suboptimal and subfreezing temperatures would impose on the growth of Douglas-fir.Results: The 3-PG process-based modeling approach, combined with automated decision tree analyses, predicted presence and absence of 15 conifers on field survey plots with an average accuracy of 82 +/- 12%. Predictive models of current distribution for each species differed in the number of, order in, and physiological thresholds selected. A deficit in the soil water balance, followed by departures from optimum temperatures in the summer were the two most important variables selected in predicting species distributions.Conclusions: Although empirical models using different sampling techniques and statistical analyses may be more accurate in predicting current distribution of species, the hybrid approach presented in this paper provides a greater mechanistic understanding of the limits to growth and tree distributions.

Such maps are useful for land use and nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM) methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca. 324,000 km(2). Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular plots of 0.9 km(2). Distribution models for each VT were obtained by logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in 100 m x 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest, whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones. Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international vegetation surveys.

Presence and absence were correctly predicted an average of 75% of the time for the eight species. At the same time, these models minimized false positives. so that presence was predicted in the correct proportion of the cases for most species. The areal proportion of the landscape on which the species were predicted to occur was in the same rank order, and of the same magnitude. as their frequency (proportion of plots in which they occurred) within the field data sets.

In the former brown coal mining area of eastern Germany, now scheduled as a nature conservation area, an analysis of the spatial distribution of vegetation was considered as an important tool in landscape planning. Therefore a comprehensive vegetation survey by means of satellite imagery (Landsat-TM), airborne imagery (CASI), and ground-based methods, notably habitat mapping and vegetation sampling was carried out. With respect to the scales of resolution the classification results of the four methods are, to a certain degree, comparable. Differences in the outcome can be ascribed to the fact that methods of low resolution result in a discrete array of polygons whereas methods of high resolution depict a mosaic structure with an underlying, continuously changing gradient. Provided that the biological meaning of the remote sensing classification is known, a shift from single vegetation patterns to the landscape scale will be possible. Neither satellite nor airborne imagery is restricted to the purpose of mapping but may also serve for vegetation classification itself."	18	0	0	0	7	2	21	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900009	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

From these data, several features were extracted related to colour, band ratios, as well as texture features calculated from colour imagery and surface elevation. Based on a systematic sampling design, field data were collected for both training and validation of a supervised classifier. Extracted features and ground truth training data were combined to calibrate a pixel-based Random forest classifier, with the purpose of devising a habitat map for the entire study area. Map validation was performed to assess classification accuracy, and feature importance metrics were calculated.Results: Validation results revealed good mean overall accuracy (0.89), with some performance decrease in situations of high interspersion of habitat types. The priority habitat type 6230* (Nardus grasslands), defining the vegetation matrix of the test site, obtained 0.96 and 0.91, considering, respectively, producer and user accuracy. In turn, priority habitat type 4020* (Atlantic wet heathlands) recorded 0.68 and 0.77. The obtained habitat map allowed measurement of the extent, description of the spatial arrangement and provided an indication of the conservation condition of target habitat types. Test results regarding the discrimination ability of different features highlighted the importance of surface elevation textures derived from the DSM, followed by band ratios textures and other more complex texture features calculated from colour imagery.Conclusions: Overall, the developed methodology showed promising results for assessing the extent and condition of habitats of high conservation priority in fine-scale, dynamic vegetation mosaics. Future advances in the use of UAV platforms may play an important role in monitoring protected sites and fulfil legal reporting obligations of EU member states, while reducing the costs associated with intensive in-field assessments."	37	3	0	0	19	0	43	2016-02-03	WOS:000368074600015	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In doing this, are measures of spectral heterogeneity useful to improve image classification performance? Which measures are the most important? How can multitemporal data be integrated in a robust framework?LocationClassical Karst (NE Italy).MethodsFirst, a habitat map was produced from field surveys. Then, a collection of 12 monthly Sentinel-2 images was retrieved. Vegetation and spectral heterogeneity (SH) indices were computed and aggregated in four combinations: (1) monthly layers of vegetation and SH indices; (2) seasonal layers of vegetation and SH indices; (3) yearly layers of SH indices computed across the months; and (4) yearly layers of SH indices computed across the seasons. For each combination, a Random Forest classification was performed, first with the complete set of input layers and then with a subset obtained by recursive feature elimination. Training and validation points were independently extracted from field data.ResultsThe maximum overall accuracy (0.72) was achieved by using seasonally aggregated vegetation and SH indices, after the number of vegetation types was reduced by aggregation from 26 to 11. The use of SH measures significantly increased the overall accuracy of the classification. The spectral beta-diversity was the most important variable in most cases, while the spectral alpha-diversity and Rao's Q had a low relative importance, possibly because some habitat patches were small compared to the window used to compute the indices.ConclusionsThe results are promising and suggest that image classification frameworks could benefit from the inclusion of SH measures, rarely included before. Habitat mapping in complex landscapes can thus be improved in a cost- and time-effective way, suitable for monitoring applications.Mapping complex habitat mosaics from remote sensing is challenging. We tested whether the novel measures of spectral heterogeneity can improve image classification performances, comparing different combinations of vegetation and spectral heterogeneity indices. Spectral beta-diversity was one of the most important variables and the seasonal aggregation of images produced the highest accuracy.image"	5	0	0	0	4	0	5	2024-01-10	WOS:001131498800001	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Because of the limitations of current remote sensing technology, it is not possible to directly measure forest understory attributes across large spatial extents, Instead we used a predictive vegetation mapping approach to model Tsuga heterophylla and Picea , sitchensis seedling patterns in a 3900-ha landscape in the Oregon Coast Range, USA, as a function of Landsat TM imagery, aerial photographs, digital elevation models, and stream maps. Because the models explained only moderate amounts of variability (R-2 values of 0.24 - 0.56), we interpreted the predicted patterns as qualitative spatial trends rather than precise maps.P. sitchensis seedling patterns were tightly linked to the riparian network, with highest densities in coastal riparian areas. T. heterophylla seedlings exhibited complex patterns related to topography and overstory forest cover, and were also spatially clustered around patches of old-growth forest. We hypothesize that the old growth served as refugia for this fire-sensitive species following wildfires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Low levels of T. heterophylla regeneration in hardwood-dominated forests suggest that these patches may succeed to shrublands rather than to conifer forest.Predictive models of seedling patterns could be developed for other landscapes where georeferenced inventory plots, remote sensing data, digital elevation models, and climate C Z maps are available."	10	0	0	0	9	0	15	2001-12-01	WOS:000174291000013	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We investigated whether inter-crown pixel information from VHR imagery could be used for taxonomic identification of trees and characterization of successional stages of tropical Andean mountain forest. Location Santa Lucia cloud forest reserve, NW Ecuadorian Andes. Methods We gathered digital camera imagery (0.05-m spatial resolution), using a remote-controlled helicopter platform, from primary and secondary forest and identified visible crowns to species before extracting digital crown samples (2-m radius). Using an object-based approach, histogram descriptors and diversity metrics of pixel intensity in red, green and blue (RGB) bands were calculated for crowns, and patterns in similarity explored using ordination. Predictive models were developed and validated using four decision tree models (CHIAD, Exhaustive CHIAD, CRT and QUEST). Results Aerial imagery represented 54% of families, 53% of genera and 56% of species sampled from the ground. Ordination (redundancy analysis) confirmed that inherent continuities, based on crown metrics, correlated with traditional species, genus and family groupings (P < 0.05). Data were best described by histogram means in the green band. The best predictive model (CRT) generated a 47% probability of correct species identification for 41 species with similar success at genus and family level. Predictive ability was highly species-specific, ranging from zero for some taxa to 93% for Cecropia gabrielis Cuatrec. Conclusions From the crown metrics tested, we found the mean pixel intensity in the green band was most effective in predicting species and species grouping of tropical mountain trees. This metric integrates species-specific differences in leaf density of crowns and reflectance in the green waveband. High predictive success for indicators of primary (Cornus peruviana J.F. Macbr.) and secondary forest (Cecropia gabrielis Cuatrec.) shows that VHR imagery can be used to identify species from pixel information to provide ecological information on successional status. Further research is needed to develop pattern and textural metrics specifically for hyperspatial digital imagery to identify tree species from crown imagery in diverse tropical forests."	8	0	0	0	4	0	9	2012-10-03	WOS:000308373500010	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	13	1	NA	NA	56	71	NA	10.1111/j.1654-109X.2009.01050.x	Article	FEB 2010	2010	"Questions: Do the vegetation-specific patterns in the forelands of river oases of the Taklamakan Desert provide clues to the degree to which a vegetation type depends on unsaturated soil moisture, brought about by extensive floodings, or phreatic water?Location: Foreland of the Qira oasis on the southern rim of the Taklamakan Desert, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China.Methods: A vegetation map was prepared using a SPOT satellite image and ground truthing. Measurements of soil water contents were obtained from a flooding experiment and transformed into water potentials. Sum excedance values were calculated as the percentage of days on which different thresholds of soil water potentials were transgressed. Groundwater depth was mapped by drilling 30 groundwater holes and extrapolating the distances to the whole study area.Results: The vegetation was characterized by only six dominant or codominant species: Alhagi sparsifolia, Karelinia caspia, Populus euphratica, Tamarix ramosissima, Calligonum caput-medusae and Phragmites australis. The vegetation patterns encountered lacked any linear features typical of phreatophytes, thus not allowing direct conclusions on the type of the sustaining water sources. Soil water potentials never transgressed a threshold of pF 5 (-10 MPa) in horizons above the capillary fringe during periods without inundation, thus representing water not accessible for plants. Depth to the groundwater ranged between 2.3 and 17.5 m among plots and varied between 1.7 and 8.0 m within a plot owing to dune relief. The seven main vegetation types showed distinct niches of groundwater depths, corresponding to the observed concentric arrangement of vegetation types around the oasis.Conclusions: Inundation by flooding and unsaturated soil moisture are irrelevant for the foreland vegetation water supply. Although distances to the groundwater table can reach about 20 m, which is exceptionally large for phreatophytes, groundwater is the only water source for all vegetation types in the oasis foreland. In consequence, successful maintenance of oasis foreland vegetation will crucially depend on providing non-declining ground water tables."	38	9	0	0	31	0	44	2010-02-01	WOS:000273601700006	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Synthetic aperture radar imagery can be more suitable in this case, as the radar signal can penetrate the forest canopy and interact with stems, providing a better estimation of the vegetation structure. This study compared the accuracy of forest species richness, tree diameter, height, and basal area estimates obtained using Sentinel-2 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite -1 (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data, either combined or separately. Location The Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Methods Field data were collected in three 3600-km(2)-window areas with three different types of tropical dry forest. Three random forest regression models were fitted: one using explanatory variables derived from Sentinel-2 data, a second using predictor variables derived from ALOS PALSAR, and the third using a combination of explanatory variables from both sensors. A variance partitioning analysis was carried out to examine the percent variability of each vegetation attribute that was explained by the models combining the explanatory variables of the two sensors (ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-2). Results Vegetation attribute estimation errors ranged from 13% to 38.5% when using ALOS PALSAR variables and from 11% to 33% when using Sentinel-2 variables. Combining variables from both sensors provided more accurate estimates of vegetation attributes. A 5% reduction of the estimated error, and an increase from 0.50 to 0.63 of the percentage of variation explained by the models (R-2) were achieved.

Methods We have used a vegetation-based land cover classification system adapted to a map scale of 1:5,000. First, a consensus map, a map that can be considered an approximation of a flawless map, was established. Secondly, the consensus map was adapted to test the accuracy of classification and polygon delineation independently. We used 10 field workers to generate a consensus map, and 14 new field workers (in pairs) to test the accuracy (n = 7). Results The results show that the accuracy of polygon delineation is lower than that of land cover classification. This is in contrast with previous studies, but previous research designs have not enabled a separation of the two accuracy components.

The distributions of 16 different remotely sensed plant communities were quantified along the gradient of flood duration.Results: Models fitted to the cumulative frequency of occurrence of different vegetation types as a function of flood duration showed that most types exist along a continuum of flood-related occurrence. The diversity of community types was greatest at high elevations (0-10 d of flooding), where both upland and lowland community types were found, as well as at very low elevations (70-180 d of flooding), where a variety of lowland herbaceous communities were found. Intermediate elevations (20-60 d of flooding) tended to be dominated by floodplain forest and had the lowest diversity of community types.Conclusions: Although variation in flood inundation is often considered to be the main driver of spatial patterns in floodplain plant communities, few studies have quantified flood-vegetation relationships at broad scales.

We performed a two-step classification process of automatic image segmentation and object-based classification to distinguish between four pre-defined classes (waterlogged bare peat, Sphagnum spp., Eriophorum vaginatum and Betula pubescens.

Methods Field data on sagebrush species and structural characteristics collected in 2005 were regressed against spectral values and transformed indices derived from Landsat TM data. Step-wise regression methods were used to build (1) a combined model that ignored species and physical differences in sagebrush, and (2) four different models that took those differences in account. Parsimonious models were selected with significant independent variables that accounted for the largest amount of the ground-measured variation in cover. Results In the combined model, a subset of Landsat bands and topographic values accounted for 65% (P < 0.001) of variance in sagebrush canopy cover.

Six methods were compared: multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), maximum entropy approach to modelling species' distributions (Maxent), two generic algorithms based on environmental metrics dissimilarity (BIOCLIM and DOMAIN), Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP), and supervised learning methods based on generalized linear classifiers (support vector machines, SVMs). To test the predictive power of the models we used the Kappa index.Results: Maxent most accurately predicted the habitat distribution of B. balearica, followed by MARS models. The other models tested yielded lower accuracy values. A comparison of the predictive power of the models revealed that climate variables made the highest contributions among the environmental variables studied. The variables that made the lowest contributions were the insolation models. To examine the sensitivity of the models to a reduction in the number of variables, a test showed that accuracy of over 0.90 was maintained by applying just three climatic variables (spring rainfall, mean temperature of the warmest month, and mean temperature of the coldest month). Maps derived from the algorithms of all models tested coincided well with the known distribution of the species.Conclusions: Model habitat prediction is a preliminary step towards highlighting areas of high habitat suitability of B. balearica.

We sampled species composition of 200 sites, with 130 of them corresponding to natural communities. Of the sampling areas 60% were used to classify, and the remaining areas to assess classification accuracy. We characterized the seasonal and interannual variability of canopy dynamics using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data provided by MODIS / Terra images.Results: Overall accuracy of the classification was satisfactory. The resulting maps showed a landscape formed by a matrix of extended lowlands with small patches of mesophytic and humid mesophytic meadows. The October scene (near the peak of productivity) was particularly important in discriminating among communities. The seasonal pattern of NDVI differed among communities and years. Mesophytic meadows had the highest NDVI mean and the lowest interannual coefficient of variation, halophytic steppes had the lowest mean, and vegetated ponds were the most variable.Conclusions: These grasslands have a fine-grained heterogeneity at the landscape scale.

In this paper we addressed the issue of the potential use of multispectral sensors by testing the hypothesis that only some of the bands recorded in a remotely sensed image contain information related to the variation in species richness.Location: Montepulciano Lake, central Italy.Methods: We assessed how data compression techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), influence the relationship between spectral heterogeneity and species richness and evaluated which spectral interval is the most adequate for predicting species richness by means of linear regression analysis.Results: The original multispectral data set and the first two non-standardized principal components can both be used as predictors of plant species richness (R-2 approximate to 0.48; p < 0.001), confirming that PCA is an effective tool for compressing multispectral data without loss of information. Using single spectral bands, the near infrared band explained 41% of variance in species richness (p < 0.01), while the visible wavelengths had much lower prediction powers.Conclusions: The potential of satellite data for estimating species richness is likely to be due to the near infrared bands, rather than to the visible bands, which share highly redundant information. Since optimal band selection for image processing is a crucial task and it will assume increasing importance with the growing availability of hyperspectral data, in this paper we suggest a 'near infrared way' for assessing species richness directly from remotely sensed data."	68	5	0	0	43	0	83	2007-12-01	WOS:000250089300004	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Satellite imagery provides a unique tool for monitoring seasonal dynamics of the Earth's vegetation on a global scale. The combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) with a daily repeat cycle and 1 km spatial resolution makes weather satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration very well suited for deriving broad-scale phenological metrics from satellite images. In this paper, similarities and differences between remotely sensed phenological studies and traditional symphenological studies conducted by ground-based observations are summarized. Finally, major shortcomings in deriving phenological metrics from NDVI time series are discussed."	19	2	0	0	10	0	21	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200014	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Natural plant communities serve as indicators of abiotic habitat conditions. Reconstruction mapping is based on the extrapolation of the potential distribution of individual vegetation units to sites of similar habitat types where the natural vegetation does not exist any more. The same procedure is used for mapping the potential natural vegetation. Both types of natural vegetation maps are identical on sites where the abiotic natural habitat conditions (relief, geological substratum, climate, water regime, soils) remain practically unchanged. On sites where the natural habitat conditions have been considerably changed by man, e.g. in areas with superficial coal mining (complete destruction of the landscape, removal of soil cover, creation of large slag heaps) or in towns, no natural (primary) vegetation exists. This causes difficulties in the hypothetical concept of the potential natural vegetation and its definition. In contrast, such site reconstruction vegetation mapping uses the extrapolation of mapping units of the primary vegetation to the original natural habitat conditions."	43	0	0	0	27	0	47	1998-01-01	CABI:19990603201	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

But can seeding a native herbaceous species mixture of local seeds reduce the establishment of an invasive shrub such as Buddleja davidii? Specifically, we asked: (1) Does competition by native species reduce B. davidii performance? (2) Is this competitive effect on B. davidii more important under higher seed densities? (3) Can it be partly attributed to light competition? (4) How do priority effects moderate this competitive effect?LocationDisturbed embankment, Is & egrave;re, France.MethodsWe conducted experiments in controlled conditions, in mesocosms and in the field. We compared the performance of B. davidii when seeded alone or in competition with local seeds, at different densities, when shaded or not and when sown before or simultaneously with respect to native species.ResultsThe seeding of a local seed mixture decreased the height, biomass and early-stage survival of Buddleja davidii. Whatever the density, these results were consistent across all three experiments. Buddleja davidii's survival rate was reduced only under the experimental conditions of high shading. When native species were sown after B. davidii, their competitive effect was very low.ConclusionsBuddleja davidii appears to be sensitive to competition during the early stages of its invasion, especially when local seedlings benefit from a time advantage, regardless of their density. In restoration contexts, native species can prevent the invasion of B. davidii if sowing is carried out as soon as possible."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-05-16	WOS:001485417900001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Here we ask which factors, aside from time since restoration began, drive the recovery of tree biomass, density and richness of the understorey in riparian forests undergoing restoration.LocationSemideciduous Atlantic Forest with tropical climate and deep, fertile soils, southeast Brazil.MethodsWe sampled tree basal area (DBH5cm), density and richness of the understorey (DBH<5cm) in 26 riparian forests undergoing restoration (a chronosequence spanning 4-53years). We assessed the following variables as possible factors, besides time, influencing community attributes: (1) planting design: density and richness of seedlings planted; (2) landscape features: proximity index measuring forest cover within a 1.5-km radius, distance and size of the nearest forest remnant; and (3) environmental factors: invasive grasses, soil fertility, drought, average annual precipitation and proportion of fine particles in the soil. We performed correlation analyses including predictor and response variables, followed by stepwise backward regression (AIC), multiple and simple linear regressions, to investigate the relationships between those factors and the community attributes.ResultsTree basal area was primarily influenced by the proportion of small particles in the soil (+) and secondarily by rainfall (-). Understorey richness was influenced by the combination of size (+) and distance (-) of the nearest patch, rainfall (-) and soil fertility (+). Understorey density was primarily influenced by the size of the nearest forest remnant (+) and secondarily by invasive grasses (-). No influence of density or richness of the seedlings planted was observed.ConclusionEnvironmental factors and landscape configuration drive the recovery of tree biomass, density and richness in communities undergoing restoration. The most relevant ecological filters influencing restoration success are availability of soil water and nutrients and the distance and size of the nearest remnant of native vegetation. The expected influence of richness and density of seedlings planted, considered for many years as important drivers of forest restoration success, was not confirmed in this study."	29	0	0	0	21	0	34	2018-01-01	WOS:000425120600009	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Has logging disturbance facilitated the spread of Fraxinus and other alien species?Location: Windward Mauna Kea, island of Hawai'i.Methods: We surveyed 29 plots which were established before selective logging of the native tree Acacia koa in 1971 to determine if Fraxinus spread beyond the borders of an existing plantation and if other alien species increased. We created gaps in the canopy of the Fraxinus plantation and measured seed rain and regeneration, and we sampled foliar and soil nutrients inside and around the plantation.Results: Basal area of Fraxinus increased front 0.7 m(2).ha(-1) in 1971 to 10.8 m(2).ha (1) in 2000. Fraxinus was not found in plots that were located more than 500 m from those where it occurred in 1971 except along a road, Basal area of Acacia koa decreased after logging but subsequently recovered. Occurrence of the alien vine Passiflora tarminiana and alien grass Ehrharta stipoides decreased. Seedling regeneration of Fraxinus was prolific in gaps but did not occur under the canopy. Basal area of Fraxinus did not correlate with soil nutrient concentrations.Conclusions: Fraxinus was able to regenerate following logging more rapidly than native tree species. Basal area growth of Fraxinus was great enough to offset a decline in native trees and cause an increase in forest productivity. If the Fraxinus plantation is harvested. managers should plan ways of favoring regeneration of the native Acacia which is more valuable both for timber and for conservation."	15	1	0	0	14	0	19	2008-12-01	WOS:000264980100005	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Although fire and livestock grazing are important disturbances, their effect on forb communities in the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairies is not fully understood. Our objectives were to: (a) determine how prescribed fire and livestock grazing influence forb community composition, cover, species richness, and diversity over a 10-year span; (b) identify indicator species for each treatment; and (c) quantify forb responses to increasing cover of the invasive grass Ventenata dubia.LocationPacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie, Oregon, USA.MethodsWe monitored plant responses in a manipulative study established in 2004 with four treatments (prescribed fire, livestock grazing, both fire and grazing, and a control with no fire or grazing). Fall burns occurred in 2006 and 2016.ResultsForb communities changed significantly over 10 years and were influenced more by fire than cattle grazing. Treatments involving fire were more associated with annual forbs and fewer perennial species than treatments not burned. Although forb cover was lower in grazed compared to ungrazed treatments, richness and diversity did not differ among treatments. Several fire-adapted forb species were associated with burned treatments. Forb cover and richness was negatively correlated with Ventenata dubia cover in 2016 and 2018 when cover of this invasive species reached 20%-37%.ConclusionsWe found fall prescribed burns at a ten-year return interval affected forb community composition and cover but not richness or diversity.

However, little is known of the drivers and potential ecological impacts of this rapidly expanding species. Here we (1) identify abiotic and biotic habitat characteristics associated with theV. dubiainvasion and examine how these differ betweenV. dubiaand other problematic non-native annual grasses,Bromus tectorumandTaeniatherum caput-medusae; and (2) determine how burning influences relationships betweenV. dubiaand plant community composition and structure to address potential impacts on Inland Northwest forest mosaic communities. Location Blue Mountains of the Inland Northwest, USA. Methods We measured environmental and plant community characteristics in 110 recently burned and nearby unburned plots. Plots were stratified to capture a range ofV. dubiacover, elevations, biophysical classes, and fire severities. We investigated relationships betweenV. dubia, wildfire, environmental, and plant community characteristics using non-metric multidimensional scaling and linear regressions. Results Ventenata dubiawas most abundant in sparsely vegetated, basalt-derived rocky scablands interspersed throughout the forested landscape. Plant communities most heavily invaded byV. dubiawere largely uninvaded by other non-native annual grasses.Ventenata dubiawas abundant in both unburned and burned areas, but negative relationships betweenV. dubiacover and community diversity were stronger in burned plots, where keystone sagebrush species were largely absent after fire. Conclusions Ventenata dubiais expanding the overall invasion footprint into previously uninvaded communities. Burning may exacerbate negative relationships betweenV. dubiaand species richness, evenness, and functional diversity, including in communities that historically rarely burned.

Concomitantly, although reductions in native woody plant species richness of large trees (>= 10 cm DBH) were not statistically significant at the community level, their densities and basal area had roughly halved in 68 yrs. Comparisons with the studies 21-27 yrs previously confirmed the tendency towards a reduction in density of larger trees, besides indicating a trend towards decline in species richness of smaller understorey trees.Conclusion: An unabated replacement of native by alien trees over the longer term is occurring in protected areas of the lowland wet forests of the BRGNP and presumably in other similarly invaded areas. Our work stresses the importance of long-term monitoring in elucidating impacts of invasive alien plants at the community level, particularly when dealing with slow-growing and long-lived species. Plausible mechanisms bringing about the observed changes and that have been found at the same or similar sites, include reduced regeneration, growth, production of flowers and fruits and increased mortality of native trees when these grow among invasive alien plants. The control of invasive alien plants, where they invade tropical forests, should be a central conservation objective even in better preserved and well protected areas."	38	0	0	0	33	0	43	2018-12-28	WOS:000396473500011	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Analyses were conducted for the entire park and its main vegetation types and ecoregions. Location: GNP is located in southern Zimbabwe, bordering Mozambique, covering approximately 5000 km2. Methods: In 2010, 313 sampling areas were surveyed, and a resurvey was conducted in 2022/2023 using a plotless method. For each area, woody species cover was recorded in four height classes. Indices for total woody cover, species richness, diversity (Shannon), and evenness (Pielou) were calculated for both surveys across the park, ecoregions, and vegetation types. Differences between surveys were analyzed with paired t-tests. Species composition changes were analyzed using NMDS and PERMANOVA, while the effects of fire frequency, slope, and distance from rivers on species composition were tested with a mixed linear model. The change in dominant species occurrence was also examined. Results: Species richness significantly declined, with no changes in woody vegetation cover, diversity, or evenness, except in the alluvial ecoregion, where diversity decreased. Changes across height layers revealed increased richness and diversity in the < 1 m layer and declines in the 1-3 m and 3-5 m layers. Species composition changes were significant across ecoregions and influenced by fire frequency. A decrease in dominant tree species was observed, varying by species' resilience to current pressures. Conclusions: GNP is undergoing simplification in woody vegetation, likely due to the combined effects of elephants and fire. This is leading to shrubbier vegetation and changes in species composition, particularly in trees. To prevent further degradation, actions must be implemented, such as the use of individual protection systems from debarking, the development of a fire management system, and the creation of ecological corridors in the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area to facilitate the movement of elephants."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-04-15	WOS:001462536800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Here, we investigated whether planting C3 and C4 native grasses (a) combined, so that resources are extracted over a longer period, or (b) at higher density would make planted communities more competitive against invasive species.LocationPara Woodlands Reserve, near Adelaide, South Australia.MethodsIn 72 experimental plots, native grasses were planted in combinations of seasonal patterns (three levels; single-season assemblages with either C3 or C4 and extended season with both C3 and C4) and planting density (two levels; high = 44 plants/m(2) and low = 20 plants/m(2)). Data were collected on native plant survival and biomass, invasive biomass and soil properties.ResultsOverall, C3 native grasses were superior competitors against both invasive C3 grasses and native C4 grasses. We found no interaction between the combination of C3 and C4 grasses planted together and density of planting. Assemblages with higher densities were successful at reducing exotic plant biomass; however, there was a trade-off with reduced individual performance among the native plants. Even though individual plants were larger in the low-density treatment, total biomass was lower in these plots suggesting that density limits the growth of native communities as a whole. The C3 native plants were planted earlier than the C4 native plants because of differences in phenology and therefore likely pre-empted resources and gained a size advantage, making them the superior competitor.ConclusionNative perennial grasses can outcompete exotic plants for resources if planted earlier in the season. This resource pre-emption appears to be more important than resource use over a longer period with C3 and C4 plants together and could be an effective restoration strategy."	2	0	0	0	2	0	2	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800003	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We used GLM to predict single species occurrence probabilities, LMM to examine differences in distribution patterns among functional types, and pCCA to examine multivariate responses of the non-native community to ecological variables.ResultsProbability of occurrence of the eight focal invasive species was not significantly related to distance from the road, but declined with elevation. Non-native species with annual life history strategies were more restricted to lower elevations than perennial species. Non-native species considered invasive occurred at lower minimum elevations than naturalized species. Shifts in the species composition of the non-native plant community were related to changes in soil and climate variables.ConclusionsOur results suggest that invasive species have similar patterns of habitat associations and spread from roadsides to interior vegetation zones, whereas naturalized species partition environmental gradients in this semi-arid montane ecosystem. Furthermore, annual and invasive species groups occupy lower elevations and perennial and naturalized species groups have invaded further up the mountain roads and into the native vegetation.

Opinions of experts who have worked with species of interest in the field can be a valuable and independent information source to validate EEM because of their first-hand experience with species occurrence and absence. However, their use in model validation is limited because of the subjectivity of their feedback. In this study, we present a method on the basis of cultural consensus theory to formalize expert model evaluations.Methods: We developed, for five tree species, distribution models with nine different variable combinations and Maxent EEM software. Species specialists validated the generated distribution maps through an online Google Earth interface with the scores from Invalid to Excellent. Experts were also asked about the commission and omission errors of the distribution models they evaluated. We weighted expert scores according to consensus theory. These values were used to obtain a final average expert score for each of the produced distribution models. The consensus-weighted expert scores were compared with un-weighted scores and correlated to four conventional model performance parameters after cross-validation with test data: Area Under Curve (AUC), maximum Kappa, commission error and omission error.Results: The median consensus-weighted expert score of all species-variable combinations was close to Fair. In general, experts that reached more consensus with peers were more positive about the EEM outcomes, compared to those that had more opposite judgements. Both consensus-weighted and un-weighted scores were significantly correlated to corresponding AUC, maximum Kappa and commission error values, but not to omission errors. More than half of the experts indicated that the distribution model they considered best included areas where the species is known to be absent. One third also indicated areas of species presence that were omitted by the model.Conclusions: Our results indicate that experts are fairly positive about EEM outcomes. This is encouraging, but EEM application for conservation actions remains limited according to them. Methods to formalize expert knowledge allow a wider use of this information in model validation and improvement, and they complement conventional validation methods of presence-only modelling.

Acer negundo, a North American tree, has widely invaded riparian forests throughout Europe at the ecotone between early- (Salix spp. and Populus spp.) and late-successional (Fraxinus spp.) species. However, it is not present in the upper part of the Rhone River, where native Alnus incana occurs at an intermediate position along the successional riparian gradient. Is this absence of the invasive tree due to environmental or biotic resistance of the recipient communities, and in particular due to the presence of Alnus? Location Upper Rhone River, France. Methods We undertook a transplant experiment in an Alnus-dominated community along the Upper Rhone River, where we compared Acer negundo survival and growth, with and without biotic interactions (tree and herb layer effects), to those of four native tree species from differing successional positions in the Upper Rhone communities (P. alba, S. alba, F. excelsior and Alnus incana). Results Without biotic interactions Acer negundo performed similarly to native species, suggesting that the Upper Rhone floodplain is not protected from Acer invasion by a simple abiotic barrier. In contrast, this species performed less well than F. excelsior and Alnus incana in environments with intact tree and/or herb layers. Alnus showed the best growth rate in these conditions, indicating biotic resistance of the native plant community. Conclusions We did not find evidence for an abiotic barrier to Acer negundo invasion of the Upper Rhone River floodplain communities, but our results suggest a biotic resistance. In particular, we demonstrated that (i) additive competitive effects of the tree and herb layer led to Acer negundo suppression and (ii) Alnus incana grew more rapidly than Acer negundo in this intermediate successional niche."	14	2	0	0	12	0	16	2013-04-03	WOS:000315690500004	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Vegetation maps (1944, 1960, 1975 and 1993) were compared for biotope cover. Vegetation recordings in 1944 and 1987 were compared. Surface water quality was compared between 1950 and 1987.

Effects of periodic mowing and groundwater discharge on vegetation development were tested for correlation.Results: Biotope diversity reduced significantly through decrease of semi-aquatic and tall-herb biotopes, and expansion of forest. The quagfen terrestrialization sere nearly disappeared from 1987 recordings, while the reed sere did well concerning abundance and species richness. Several typical (rich) fen species disappeared from recordings, while new species were mostly field margin species.

Periodic mowing and discharge stimulate species richness, discharge more so than periodic mowing. But slight eutrophication likely induced a shift from P-limitation to N-limitation, which stimulated the reed sere at the expense of the quagfen sere."	22	0	0	0	19	0	25	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Early-successional stages of woody vegetation on gravel bars were studied in an island-braided section of the River Tagliamento in northeastern Italy. We mapped landscape-level changes in the study area (125 ha) by GIS-based analysis of aerial photographs for two time periods (19841986, 19861991); we surveyed island vegetation, and estimated island age by tree ring analysis. The study area experienced considerable changes between 1984 and 1991 due to at least two major floods in 1987 and 1990. The development of woody vegetation on bars follows three distinct phases: (1) gravel bars plus large woody debris (LWD), (2) pioneer islands, and (3) established islands. Established islands have sections dominated by shrubs of Salix elaeagnos, S. purpurea, S. daphnoides and S. triandra, and tree-dominated sections with Populus nigra, Salix alba and Alnus incana. Large woody debris seems to play a key role for plant colonization on gravel bars. The succession from bars to established islands took about 10 - 20 yr, and the probability of an island being washed away decreased with island age. Erosion produced new LWD which again initiated successional processes in the active zone of the river. Most species were already present in the early-successional stages, although the number of species increased with island development. Established islands were characterized by a distinctive species composition, including an assemblage of species less tolerant of inundation. The results are discussed within the framework of island dynamics and its significance for restoration of early-successional habitats in more regulated rivers."	127	0	0	0	45	0	138	1999-05-01	WOS:000208472000004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Habitat degradation in the Atlantic Forest domain and extensive road networks could facilitateAcaciainvasion into Mussununga. Objectives We investigated whether: (a) landscape permeability (measured by effective conductance) facilitatesAcaciainvasion; (b) forest fragments are barriers, and roads and highways are corridors for invasive spread ofAcacia; and (c) size and shape of Mussununga patches play a role in biological invasion. Methods Acaciainvasion was investigated in 32 Mussununga sites within the Atlantic Forest domain. We tested the effect of a set of landscape permeability scenarios based on circuit analysis and nine other metrics of landscape structure onAcaciaoccurrence using three buffer-zone sizes (0.5, 1, and 2 km). Results The likelihood ofAcaciainvasion significantly increased with landscape permeability. The best-fitting landscape permeability scenario designated road networks as corridors, intact forests and water surfaces as barriers, and degraded habitats as non-barriers. We also found that Mussununga areas within a 0.5 km buffer negatively affected the biological invasion byAcacia. Conclusions Extensive habitat degradation by deforestation and dense road networks facilitateAcaciainvasion into sandy-savanna Mussununga ecosystems. Landscape permeability may be used as a risk-assessment tool for biological invasion byAcaciaspecies. Mussununga patches can be protected fromAcaciainvasion through preserving or restoring forest belts around them and disconnecting them from the road network."	14	1	0	0	11	0	15	2020-09-18	WOS:000566358400001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Our case study aims to demonstrate how they can be integrated, by analysing the variation of IAP distribution within biogeographic territories, identifying the potential native plant communities and the ecological conditions that favour (or prevent) each IAP.Location Southern Portugal.Methods Several native plant indicators and nine selected IAPs were surveyed in 60 1-km(2) sampling plots across the four biogeographic sectors of the study area. The native plant indicators were then used to identify the vegetation series in which IAPs occurred. Ecological requirements favouring the establishment of each IAP were inferred based on expert knowledge and on the characteristics of published vegetation series and bioclimatic data.Results Littoral areas were more invaded, particularly those with sand dune habitats, which are highly dynamic and exposed to disturbance. The most frequent IAPs were Acacia dealbata, Arundo donax, Acacia longifolia and Opuntia ficus-indica. Riparian vegetation series were the most invaded, especially ash woodlands and willow galleries, as well as the littoral psammophilous cork oak and maritime turbinate juniper series. The most adequate native species to recover each of these invaded communities varies, and examples are provided for each situation.Conclusions Integrating knowledge about IAP ecological requirements and the dynamics of native vegetation series can help practitioners select native plants that are more likely to function as efficient natural barriers to (re)invasion, predict areas more prone to invasion by IAPs and establish management priorities."	11	0	0	0	7	0	12	2020-04-28	WOS:000526605300001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

There is a considerable local and regional variation in the level of alien plant invasion on coastal dunes. We asked what are the patterns of invasion across European coastal dunes and how they depend on habitat types and coastal regions.Location Atlantic, Baltic, Black Sea and Mediterranean coasts of Europe.Methods We used vegetation-plot records from shifting dunes and stable dune grasslands extracted from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA). We quantified richness, frequency and distribution of alien plant (neophyte) species across dune habitats and coastal regions. We also explored the donor habitats and invasion trajectories of these species.Results In the flora of European coastal dunes, 7% of species were neophytes, for two-thirds originating from outside of Europe and mostly naturalised and ruderal. Shifting and stable dunes were similar in neophyte species composition, but there were more individual occurrences of neophytes in shifting dunes. The neophyte flora composition differed considerably between the Atlantic, Baltic, Black Sea and Mediterranean regions. The highest number of neophyte species was observed on the Atlantic dunes, while the highest number of neophyte occurrences was on the Black Sea dunes. Most of the neophytes originated from North America and the Mediterranean-Turanian region. Erigeron canadensis, Xanthium orientale, Oenothera biennis and Oenothera oakesiana were the most common neophytes.Conclusions We provided a comprehensive assessment of alien plant invasions in the coastal dunes across Europe and highlighted that coastal dunes should be in the focus of European invasion management strategies."	45	1	0	0	41	0	51	2020-04-19	WOS:000526626800001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To honor this program, a symposium at the Ecological Society of America meetings was organized to explore the state of succession theory and its contribution to the field of ecology and its application to restoration. The BSS was originally motivated by two controversies in the literature during the 1950's. The first wits between a community versus and individual basis of secondary succession. The second was the validity of the Initial Floristic Composition hypothesis.Location: Hutcheson Memorial Forest, Somerset, New Jersey, USAMethods: Vegetation composition and cover has been continuously quantified in permanent plots established in 10 old fields.Continued Research Motivation: The rich data set has documented population and community dynamics and the spatio-temporal controls and historical contingencies that influence those dynamics. The regulation of community dynamics continues to be a line of inquiry as does the application Of results to restoration and understanding the dynamics of non-native species.Conclusions: Long term vegetation studies are uncommon in ecology yet they are uniquely Valuable for understanding system dynamics - particularly if the studies capture periodic events or system shifts Such as droughts and invasions by non-native species. Resilient long term Studies, of which the BSS is all example, maintain methods and data Structure while allowing motivating questions to evolve along side advancements in the theoretical and Conceptual realms of the field.

Grassland biome, South Africa.Methods: On both sides of this road. presence and abundance of exotic plants was recorded in four 25-m long road-verge plots and in parallel 25 m x 2 m adjacent land plots, nested at five altitudinal levels: 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400 and 2700 in a.s.l. Exotic community structure was analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis while a two-level nested Generalized Linear Model was fitted for richness and cover of exotics. We tested the upper altitudinal limits tor all exotics along this road for spatial clustering around four potential propagule sources Using a t-test.Results: Community structure, richness and abundance of exotics were negatively correlated with altitude. Greatest invasion by exotics was recorded for adjacent land at the 1500 in level. Of the 45 exotics, 16 were found at higher altitudes than expected and observations were spatially clustered around potential propagule sources.Conclusions: Spatial clustering of upper altitudinal limits around human inhabited areas suggests that exotics originate from these areas, while exceeding expected altitudinal limits suggests that distribution ranges of exotics are presently underestimated. Excites are generally characterised by a high propagule pressure and/or persistent seedbanks, thus future tarring of the Sani Pass may result in art increase of exotic species richness and abundance. This would initially result from construct ion-related soil disturbance and subsequently from increased traffic. water run-off, and altered fire frequency.

Seedlings of the five species were grown with or without the potential invader and under three watering regimes: early stress - Simulating an advanced summer, late stress - simulating the characteristic timing Of Current summer drought and well-watered.Results: Seedling survival and performance were negatively affected by the presence of the potential invader. Early stress had larger impacts on the gypsum species than late stress, No interactions were found between factors for any of the study variables, and responses to both factors were found to be species-specific.Conclusions: The lack of interactions between factors indicates that the presence of the potentially invasive grass and water stress had additive effects in Our Study system. The negative impact of early water stress draws attention to the possible consequences of the advances of summer drought predicted for Mediterranean ecosystems. Finally, the differential responses found for the study species suggest that plant communities will not respond as a unit to global change, leading to significant changes in species composition and dominance."	18	0	0	0	16	0	18	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Daisen, western Japan.Methods: Vegetation patterns before and after industrialization were obtained from maps drawn in 1898 and 1979. Tree measurements were made in 12 plots in 1997. Correlation between current Fagus crenata dominance and forest edge in the 19th century was analysed using an S-shaped regression curve. Fagus juvenile density was counted in the plots, and distances from each plot to the five nearest mother trees were measured to determine the dispersal kernel.Results: Secondary grassland covered a substantial area in 1898, whereas forest covered most of the area in 1997. Fagus was dominant in places in the interior forest 100 years ago, and mature Fagus trees were absent in secondary forests that had been grasslands in 1898. The expected number of juveniles decreased to one individual per 100 m(2) at 43.5 m from the mother tree.Conclusions: The pre-industrialization landscape greatly affected recovery of Fagus forest. Forests found on the 1898 vegetation map might have acted as refugia for Fagus. The limited dispersal ability of Fagus suggests that it would take many generations (several hundred years) for Fagus forests to recover at the centre of what had been grasslands in the 19th century."	10	0	0	0	8	0	11	2005-11-01	WOS:000235079600002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

(2016, Applied Vegetation Science, 19 (Suppl. 1), 3-264). However, this checklist did not contain detailed information on the distribution of individual vegetation types. Here we provide the first maps of all alliances in Europe. Location Europe, Greenland, Canary Islands, Madeira, Azores, Cyprus and the Caucasus countries. Methods We collected data on the occurrence of phytosociological alliances in European countries and regions from literature and vegetation-plot databases. We interpreted and complemented these data using the expert knowledge of an international team of vegetation scientists and matched all the previously reported alliance names and concepts with those of the EuroVegChecklist. We then mapped the occurrence of the EuroVegChecklist alliances in 82 territorial units corresponding to countries, large islands, archipelagos and peninsulas. We subdivided the mainland parts of large or biogeographically heterogeneous countries based on the European biogeographical regions. Specialized alliances of coastal habitats were mapped only for the coastal section of each territorial unit. Results Distribution maps were prepared for 1,105 alliances of vascular-plant dominated vegetation reported in the EuroVegChecklist. For each territorial unit, three levels of occurrence probability were plotted on the maps: (a) verified occurrence; (b) uncertain occurrence; and (c) absence. The maps of individual alliances were complemented by summary maps of the number of alliances and the alliance-area relationship. Distribution data are also provided in a spreadsheet. Conclusions The new map series represents the first attempt to characterize the distribution of all vegetation types at the alliance level across Europe. There are still many knowledge gaps, partly due to a lack of data for some regions and partly due to uncertainties in the definition of some alliances. The maps presented here provide a basis for future research aimed at filling these gaps."	49	0	0	0	51	0	60	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000008	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	19	2	NA	NA	218	224	NA	10.1111/avsc.12225	Article	APR 2016	2016	"Questions: Common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.) is an invasive 'super species' that has invaded extensive areas in Europe, forming novel ecosystems. One study has reported neutral effects of common milkweed on the native flora of sand dune grasslands in Hungary after the removal of invasive pine plantation. However, the effects of common milkweed on native flora more generally are unknown. Focusing on the potential effect of milkweed, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) the cover of native grassland species decreases with increasing cover of common milkweed; and (2) native species with low specific leaf area (SLA), height, seed mass and clonal spreading ability (i.e. low competitive ability) are more likely suppressed by milkweed compared with natives with high competitive ability.Location: Late successional sandy old-fields invaded by milkweed in the Great Hungarian Plain (Kiskunsag, central Hungary).Methods: We recorded the cover of vascular plants in seven old-fields; in each old-field we sampled 12 plots including plots with different milkweed cover and control plots without milkweed. We used linear mixed effect models for exploring the effects of milkweed on the species richness and cover of native grassland species. To identify the common traits of the most affected native species, we used trait-based analyses; we studied leaf-height-seed traits and clonal spreading ability.Results: We detected no effect of common milkweed on total species richness, but it had a negative effect on the cover of grassland species. The negative effect of common milkweed was most pronounced on the cover of species with low SLA, low seed mass and low clonal spreading ability.Conclusions: Our results suggest that native, late successional sandy grasslands invaded by common milkweed form undesirable novel ecosystems because of significant negative impacts on the cover of native grassland species, especially those species with low competitive ability. For these species, management of milkweed might be needed to ensure their persistence in sandy grasslands in this landscape."	50	0	0	0	42	0	58	2016-06-01	WOS:000374545600006	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Ruellia simplex (Mexican petunia) invades floodplain forests in Florida, and is controlled with glyphosate herbicide. Will herbicide application used to control this weed allow establishment of native vegetation and limit R. simplex?Location: Floodplain forest altered by stormwater run-off, Lake Jesup Conservation Area, Sanford, FL, US.Methods: We evaluated re-vegetation following herbicide application to control R. simplex. For re-vegetation, we planted or seeded native species (Andropogon glomeratus, Juncus effusus, Panicum longifolium, Solidago fistulosa) and measured stem density, percentage cover, above-ground biomass and species richness for 1 yr. We compared the results to those from control plots (i.e. no herbicide, no re-vegetation) and plots where R. simplex was sprayed with herbicide but not planted or seeded with native species.Results: Unassisted re-colonization (i.e. plots where R. simplex was sprayed but not planted or seeded with native species) did not result in native plant restoration. Re-vegetation treatments (i.e. plots where R. simplex was sprayed and planted or seeded with native species) did not restore native vegetation; nor did re-vegetation treatments reduce R. simplex stem density, percentage cover or biomass compared to control plots. However, total species richness, including native and exotic species richness, increased in plots planted with a native plug mix compared to control plots (i.e. no herbicide, no re-vegetation). Native species failed to germinate in all seeding treatments. Plugs had adequate survival (2-57% depending on species) but did not prevent re-invasion of R. simplex. Re-invasion of R. simplex occurred in plots despite application of glyphosate herbicide and re-vegetation treatments.Conclusions: Re-vegetation by seeding or planting did not establish native vegetation in the first year, instead, R. simplex reinvaded. Abiotic and biotic site conditions, e.g. invasive species propagule pressure and altered soil nutrients, may have limited seed germination and survival of planted seedlings. More research is necessary to determine if a reduction in invasive species propagules through repeated herbicide application coupled with planting native species results in native plant restoration in the longer term."	11	0	0	0	9	0	12	2016-02-03	WOS:000368074600005	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What are the characteristics of sandy beach species for regenerating their populations and the invasion patterns of originally non-sandy beach species or other newcomers after the tsunami?Location: Phuket Island, southern Thailand.Methods: Species composition of beaches was studied on the same research plots 6 months before and 9 months after the tsunami. The changes in individual species cover before and after the tsunami were determined by chi(2) tests. Change in community composition was analysed by detrended correspondence analysis. The relationship between species and environmental factors was analysed by canonical correspondence analysis.Results: The sites disturbed by the tsunami were often invaded by annuals, especially grasses and asteraceous plants, rather than by perennials. In contrast, species with clonal growth by stolons decreased significantly. Factors determining the species habitat differences were soil hardness (penetration resistance of sandy soil), per cent silt content, soil water content and beach management. Habitat differences among originally non-sandy beach herbaceous species that expanded their population or moved to the coast after the disaster were defined by sand accretion or erosion caused by the tsunami. Many sandy beach herbaceous communities changed into Dactyloctenium aegyptium communities because of the tsunami were originally constituted by non-sandy beach D. aegyptium with Cenchrus echinatus. Although the forest floors of most maritime forests were invaded by originally non-sandy beach Tridax procumbens, Eleusine indica or D. aegyptium because of the tsunami, this did not result in a change in the vegetation unit, because species' loss was restricted to the understorey. In time, these forests will recover their previous community composition.Conclusions: Our results suggest that originally non-sandy beach native species invaded the disturbed beaches rapidly after the tsunami but their habitats differ. Sites where sand accumulated on a beach because of the tsunami were invaded by D. aegyptium and E. indica, whereas soil erosion permitted invasion by Digitania adscendens. Tridax procumbens establishes rapidly on wet sites with hard soil, high per cent silt content and low beach management pressure. Sandy beach species with subterranean long rhizomes are strongly tolerant of such disasters. We concluded that the species composition of the beaches disturbed by a temporary large disaster is determined by dormancy and growth forms, with radicoid form being influential."	17	1	0	0	11	0	20	2009-04-09	WOS:000267484100008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Changes in vascular species composition and abundance were examined in coastal vegetation at Hobart, Tasmania, Australia over a period of 13 yr, during which suburbanization extended to cover a large proportion of its hinterland. There were significant increases in the richness and cover of exotic vascular plant species, most of which derived from the Mediterranean basin or southern Africa. While most of the introduced species were confined to vegetation with a high exotic component, and close to domestic gardens, some, including the South African coastal shrub, Chrysanthemoides monilifera, expanded in otherwise native vegetation relatively remote from gardens. The impact of proximity to gardens on the relative abundance of exotics and natives in coastal vegetation in 1997 best correlated with the pattern of distance from gardens in 1966, suggesting that there is, at least, a 30-yr lag period in transformation from largely native to substantially exotic vegetation. This lag period provides an opportunity to reduce exotic invasion problems before they become severe."	16	0	0	0	15	0	18	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300012	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This approach was tested using data from a survey and subsequent resurvey of Scottish coastal vegetation.Location: Scotland, UK.Results: Fixed dunes, slacks, unimproved grassland and mires showed the highest functional overlap through time (high correspondence in convex hull position between two surveys), while salt marsh, improved grassland and heath showed the lowest. Fixed dune was the most stable in terms of retaining the highest proportion of the original convex hull, while salt marsh was least stable. Salt marsh also showed the highest new functional space occupied, whilst mires and slacks showed the least colonization by functionally distinct species. Generally sites on the west coast of Scotland were most stable, while those on the east showed the greatest functional changes. Assessing functional beta-diversity provided a different picture to assessing species beta-diversity; high species turnover might have little impact on the functional characteristics of the vegetation, whereas the invasion of one functionally different species can have a sizeable impact on ecosystem processes.Conclusions: The method proved effective in highlighting habitats and sites where species changes had the largest impact on the functional space occupied by the plant assemblage. The method provides complementary information to that derived from other types of analysis, including about the potential needs for improved management or full-scale restoration."	6	0	0	0	5	0	6	2018-05-08	WOS:000430912500010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	YES

To complement this experiment, we selected areas not invaded by this grass with similar geomorphological features. We performed vegetation surveys of plant species richness and abundance in all plots and compared temporal changes in vegetation among treatments during a period of 31 mo (from May 2007 to December 2009). We also analysed the associations between changes in species richness and plant abundance with changes in environmental conditions at the plot level and at the island level (precipitation and temperature). ResultsPlant abundance increased following grass removal but changes in abundance were not necessarily linear over time. Species richness was significantly higher in grass removal plots but differences resulted from a consistent decrease in richness in plots with Megathyrsus. Both abundance and richness were highly variable over time regardless of treatment. The evaluation of temporal community dynamics suggested that these may be driven by temporal changes in climate, and in the case of manipulated plots, by changes in microclimatic conditions. Even when new species arrived into plots following grass removal these failed to establish. An evaluation of successional trajectories showed that removing the invasive grass does not lead to communities that are more similar to non-invaded sites, most likely due to changes in precipitation dynamics.ConclusionsGrass removal does not necessarily result in predictable successional changes in plant communities where natural regeneration is allowed to occur. Restoring grass-invaded areas in this semi-arid reserve to conditions that simulate current non-invaded sites would likely require restoration strategies that combine grass management with activities that facilitate the establishment of native species. This may be a general occurrence in grass-invaded areas in semi-arid regions."	13	0	0	0	13	0	15	2012-10-03	WOS:000308373500007	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Owing to the importance of both mowing and grazing Ellenberg indicator values were not used in the identification process.Results: The final regional species pool consisted of 227 species, of which 194 were extracted from the flora, while 33 agricultural landscape species were added from the actual pool or from a list of species in additional hay meadows. Some of the 33 species were regular inhabitants of hay meadows, others were rare in the region. The regional species pool list includes information on each species on demands when hydrology, nutrients and base saturation in the soil is concerned, and whether or not they are characteristic for either of the boreal or boreo-nemoral vegetation zones.Conclusions: Specialist knowledge was an advantage when adding cultural landscape species other than meadow species of the flora; 77 species were documented only by the flora, interesting from the point of view of restoration as this part of the pool would not have been found by just adding species lists.

It has been speculated that overgrazing by an increasing number of cattle, lack of grazing in abandoned areas, or large-scale changes in environmental conditions may be the reason for this invasion. This study focuses on ecological and ecophysiological aspects of Vochysia divergens (cambara), a flood-tolerant tree that began spreading in the Pantanal during the last 30 years and is considered a very aggressive invasive plant. The study shows that the spread of cambard can be related to natural multi-years wet periods. During multi-years dry periods the species is reduced by the increasing impact of fires in the Pantanal. This points to the great importance of multi-years climatic events on the vegetation cover of the Pantanal and indicates a very dynamic development in plant communities."	84	1	0	0	76	31	102	2004-05-01	WOS:000221960200012	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We report results from a five-year field experiment in western Oregon, USA that evaluates the effects of different mowing regimes on the non-native and invasive perennial grass Arrhenatherum elatius, the native perennial prairie grasses Danthonia californica and Festuca roemeri, and groups of other native and non-native grasses and forbs. Eight treatments were designed to test hypotheses about the role of mowing height and time of application on the plant community.Differences among treatments emerged only after two or three years of treatment. This delay in response reinforces the need for long-term studies. Annual mowing was most effective at reducing Arrhenatherum cover and flowering when applied in late spring or early summer, the time of Arrhenatherum flowering and expected maximum above-ground allocation. Double mowing and mowing at 15 cm were more effective in reducing Arrhenatherum cover than were single mowing and mowing at 50 cm. All treatments increased the cover and flowering of Danthonia. Statistical model analysis showed that increases in cover and flowering of the native grass Danthonia were caused by its release from suppression by Arrhenatherum. Four years of the most effective treatment, mowing at 15 cm in late spring, converted an Arrhenatherum-dominated site to a prairie dominated by native grasses. This is one of the few documented cases of pest plant control causing an increase in native plant abundance.

However, data that are able to link those trends are scarce. Here, we use data from a repeated habitat mapping program to test consistency between habitat type and species change.LocationFederal state of Baden-W & uuml;rttemberg, Germany.MethodsWe derived temporal trends over several decades concerning: (a) the extent of all protected habitat types across the state, (b) plant species across the state, and (c) plant species within habitat types. We tested the consistency between trends in the extent of every protected habitat type with trends of those species that prefer that particular habitat type, as well as with mean trends of all species that occur within that particular habitat type.ResultsWe found that, on average, most protected habitat types decreased in area, with the exception of forests, which showed positive trends. Species analysis showed positive trends for species preferring the habitat types scrubs, copses and field hedges, as well as bog, carr, swamp and alluvial forests. By contrast, negative trends were found for species preferring the habitat types heaths and semi-natural grasslands, meadows and pastures. While non-native species increased, species that were considered endangered decreased. A species' trend across Baden-W & uuml;rttemberg mostly followed the trend of the species' preferred habitat type. However, within some habitat types, the mean species' trend did not follow the trend of those habitat types' extent. Decreasing species within habitat types were especially those that preferred each particular habitat type.ConclusionsOur results point to an ongoing turnover of floristic composition, and thus to changes in habitat quality within habitat types. This implies that future monitoring programs should track temporal trends of both habitat types and the species occurring in these habitat types as a measure of habitat quality, because they can show diverging trends.We used repeated habitat mapping data to show that temporal trends of protected habitat types and their inhabiting plant species are not always consistent. We further found that species often decreased within their preferred habitat type, whereas non-characteristic species showed more positive trends.image"	2	0	0	0	1	0	2	2024-08-21	WOS:001291845600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

As J. aquatica mainly occurs in species-rich wet grasslands, our aim was to define management measures that do not reduce the conservation value of the resident communities. Location Data were collected from 20 independent sites which varied in productivity and management intensity across the pre-alpine Allgau region (South Germany). Methods We monitored effects of temporary abandonment and decreased mowing intensity in very low- and low-productive sites, as well as of decreased mowing and fertilization at moderately productive sites. Abundances of J. aquatica and the co-occurring species were recorded at start and end of two experiments (2018-2021: very low- and low-productive conservation grasslands; 2017-2020: moderately productive agricultural grasslands), while functional traits data of all species were gathered from the literature and specific databases. Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) were used to analyse the effects of management intensity on the abundance of J. aquatica, functional diversity and species richness of the resident communities. Results At all productivity levels, the abundance of J. aquatica declined under reduced management. Changes in community composition and species richness of the resident community were less pronounced than the reduction of J. aquatica, but species richness declined under lowest management intensities. Thus, moderate reduction in management intensity provided the most benefits in terms of reduction of J. aquatica, and maintenance of species richness and composition of the resident plant community. Conclusions Reducing management intensity in wet grasslands decreases the abundance of J. aquatica and thus is a suitable method to control this species. As plant community responses were only partially consistent, management plans must account for the productivity of invaded sites. To avoid negative effects on grassland biodiversity, only moderate suppression of J. aquatica is recommended."	7	0	0	0	5	0	7	2022-09-01	WOS:000844119200001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How has land cover changed from 1950-2011 along two grassland/forest ecotones in Hawaii with repeated fires?Location Non-native forest with invasive grass understory and invasive grassland (Megathyrsus maximus) ecosystems on Oahu, Hawaii, USA.Methods We quantified fuel load and moisture in non-native forest and grassland (Megathyrsus maximus) plots (n=6) at Makua Military Reservation and Schofield Barracks, and used these field data to model potential fire behaviour using the BehavePlus fire modelling program. Actual rate and extent of land-cover change were quantified for both areas from 1950-2011 with historical aerial imagery.Results Live and dead fuel moisture content and fine fuel loads did not differ between forests and grasslands. However, mean surface fuel height was 31% lower in forests (72cm) than grasslands (105cm; P<0.02), which drove large differences in predicted fire behaviour. Rates of fire spread were 3-5 times higher in grasslands (5.0-36.3mmin(-1)) than forests (0-10.5mmin(-1); P<0.001), and flame lengths were 2-3 times higher in grasslands (2.8-10.0m) than forests (0-4.3m; P<0.01). Between 1950 and 2011, invasive grassland cover increased at both Makua (320ha) and Schofield (745ha) at rates of 2.62 and 1.83hayr(-1), respectively, with more rapid rates of conversion before active fire management practices were implemented in the early 1990s.Conclusions These results support accepted paradigms for the tropics, and demonstrate that type conversion associated with non-native grass invasion and subsequent fire has occurred on landscape scales in Hawaii. Once forests are converted to grassland there is a significant increase in fire intensity, which likely provides the positive feedback to continued grassland dominance in the absence of active fire management."	42	0	0	0	38	0	54	2014-11-05	WOS:000342839200009	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How does the removal of invasive trees through complete clearing and thinning facilitate the recovery of native vegetation? Location Berg River, Western Cape, South Africa. Methods We assessed the recovery of native vegetation after 4yr of complete clearing of the invasive tree Eucalyptus camaldulensis (100% alien cover removal) and thinning (4050% alien cover removal) along the Berg River in the Western Cape, South Africa. Native and alien plant cover, species richness and diversity were recorded on completely cleared and thinned sites and compared to natural (non-invaded control sites) and E.camaldulensis invaded sites. Results Species richness and diversity were significantly higher in both completely cleared and thinned sites compared to natural and invaded sites. Increases in species richness and diversity in completely cleared and thinned sites were a result of re-invasion by alien herbaceous and graminoid species, which have the potential to hinder native species recovery. Cover of native trees and shrubs was higher in both completely cleared and thinned sites compared to invaded sites. Species composition (relative cover) in completely cleared and thinned sites was similar to species composition in natural sites.

Mesocosms were sown with P. arundinacea (0, 10, 50, 100, or 500 seeds/m(2)) and a mix of native species (3000 or 15000 seeds/m(2)).Results: When planted at densities > 100 seeds/m(2), P. arundinacea increased suppression of native species. Also, high native seed density suppressed P. arundinacea biomass production. This effect was more pronounced when P. arundinacea seed density was high (> 100 seeds/m(2)), but high native seed density (15000 seeds/m(2)) did not suppress recruitment of P. arundinacea from seed.Conclusions: The transition from post-control bare ground (a common result of efforts to control invasive species) to native species establishment depends on both native species and invader seed density. These results suggest that a threshold of P. arundinacea propagule pressure exists, beyond which transition to a native community is less likely without management intervention.

Therefore, using fine-scale data on bryophyte assemblages in traditionally managed secondary grasslands, we studied the relative importance of several sets of environmental drivers (related to topography, soil properties, landscape, and management) of: (i) taxonomic and functional compositions; and (ii) cover and species richness of bryophyte communities. Location Central and Eastern Europe, Carpathian Mountains, 15 sites with preserved traditional management practices distributed in Romania (six sites), Ukraine (four), Slovakia (two), Austria (one), Hungary (one) and Poland (one). Methods Fine-scale data on soil, topography, and vegetation structure as well as on bryophyte assemblages (taxonomic and functional composition, cover, species richness) were collected in 10-m(2) plots. We used stratified random sampling to select six 10-m(2) plots of traditionally managed grasslands in each of the 15 sites (n = 90). Climatic and landscape variables were extracted from online databases and available maps. Detailed data on present and historical land use were obtained from parcel owners. To assess the effect of drivers on bryophyte taxonomic and functional composition we applied canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA), respectively; for bryophyte species richness and bryophyte cover we used GLMMs. Forward stepwise variable selection procedure was used to find best set of drivers for each of the analyses. Results Topographic (microrelief and solar radiation) and soil-related factors (cover of stones and rocks, soil depth, moisture), as well as the cover of the herb layer and bare soil were the strongest drivers of bryophyte taxonomic composition. Among the management- and landscape-related variables only mean size of grassland parcels within 1-km(2) plot surroundings and grazing by horse were included in the CCA model explaining in total 25.9% of variation in species composition. Bryophyte functional composition was explained by a similar set of variables (RDA explained 27.3% of variation in functional composition) including additionally cover of gravel and burning. Solar radiation (negative effect) and management stability (positive effect) were the strongest drivers of bryophyte cover. Management stability had the strongest effect (positive) on bryophyte species richness, followed by grassland age (negative) and microrelief (positive). Conclusions Taxonomic and functional composition of bryophyte assemblages as well as bryophyte cover in traditional grasslands were determined mainly by variables related to moisture and light availability. Management-related factors seem to be at least as equally important as abiotic factors for bryophyte species richness and cover.

After eight years, will the restored plant communities differ from those in untreated areas? Location Bass River Recreation Area, Ottawa County, MI, USA. Methods We studied the effects of site preparation (mowing, clopyralid, glyphosate), hand pulling of C. stoebe, and burning on restoring native plant communities on a C. stoebe-infested site. Over eight years, we quantified the development of the plant communities on plots seeded with native grasses and forbs, and report on the second four years here. Results Native-dominated plant communities developed using both herbicides, but while clopyralid provided longer control of C. stoebe, clopyralid-treated plots had fewer native species than glyphosate-treated plots. Native-dominated plant communities also developed on plots that were only mowed once before seeding, achieving similar native species richness as the glyphosate treatment. Hand pulling controlled C. stoebe, burning increased relative cover of native graminoids and decreased that of non-native grasses, and hand pulling and burning in combination increased relative cover of native forbs. After eight years, the restored plant communities had greater native species cover and richness and higher mean Coefficient of Conservatism, Floristic Quality Index, and Shannon's Diversity Index values than untreated areas.

In the Magellanic tussock steppes, as in other cold-temperate regions, grazing capacity is dependent on the winter season. To develop a management tool for the region, we analysed links between winter forage availability, weather, stocking rate and vegetation structure. We studied four paddocks over five years with a range of stocking rates from 0 to 1.53 sheep.ha(-1). We sampled forb and non-tussock graminoid biomass, vegetation structure and faecal pellet abundance at the end of each summer. Daily temperature and rainfall data were also recorded. A regression model explained the amount of winter forage as a positive function of graminoid cover, spring minimum temperature, annual precipitation and a negative function of dwarf shrub canopy, bare soil and stocking rate (R-2 = 0.59). Interactions of structural variables with precipitation and stocking rate were detected, indicating strong fluctuations of forage availability in lawn communities dominated by short graminoids. The most probable causes of this response would be higher utilisation and lack of canopy structure. Our results illustrate how maps of vegetation structure, obtainable from satellite images, with weather and stocking rate data could be used for predicting optimal stocking rates in large, heterogeneous sheep paddocks."	14	0	0	0	12	3	17	2002-12-01	WOS:000181162900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Here we ask: do environmental conditions differ between forest stands invaded by it and uninvaded stands? Do these differences correlate with R. ponticum's cover? Are these differences associated with differences in taxonomic and functional diversity of vascular plant species of the herb layer? Can these vegetation changes be explained by the sorting of certain life-history traits by R. ponticum-induced environmental changes?Location: Several forests invaded by R. ponticum in the French Atlantic domain.Methods: We recorded vegetation composition and a number of environmental variables in 400-m(2) plots that were established in 64 paired forest stands (32 invaded vs 32 uninvaded). We compiled traits from existing databases. We computed several metrics of taxonomic and functional diversity. We compared environmental variables and diversity metrics between invaded and uninvaded stands. We used correlation and regression analyses to relate them with R. ponticum's cover. We ran RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to explore the relationships between R. ponticum invasion, environmental variables, species traits, and vegetation composition.Results: Independent of its abundance, R. ponticum invasion was associated with lower light arrival at the forest floor and increased litter thickness. Concomitantly, species richness and diversity and trait diversity were reduced. The major driver of species assemblages was soil pH, which strongly interacted with the invasion gradient. R. ponticum did not sort species according to traits associated with shade tolerance and thick-litter tolerance. However, tree and shrub saplings were more abundant in invaded than uninvaded stands, at the expense of graminoid and fern species.Conclusions: As R. ponticum becomes the dominant shrub, it exerts new selection forces on life-history traits of extant species, mostly via reduced light availability, increased litter thickness, and physical competition, thereby reducing taxonomic and functional diversity of the herb layer, without impeding tree and shrub self-regeneration, at least in the short term."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2023-09-25	WOS:001020263600001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Old fields abandoned after decades of land use as pasture or croplands, occupied by ruderal plants and invasive grasses.Methods We established a direct seeding experiment with ten tree species native to the cerrado (Brazilian savanna) region. We used a factorial design in five blocks, with the following factors: (a) species; (b) weed control and (c) intercropping with native grasses. We evaluated the emergence, survival and growth of plants, and through multiple regressions we sought to explain the success of the species in direct seeding based on their functional traits.Results Emergence and survival in the field varied widely among species but with little or no difference between treatments. Growth was compromised by weed competition in all species. Intercropping with native grasses did not decrease weed competition. We found a functional pattern associated with species performance in direct seeding, where survival in the field is positively associated with seed mass, root depth and a greater root:shoot ratio.Conclusion Weed competition impairs seedling growth more than survival, considerably delaying restoration by direct seeding. The success of this method in the savanna will depend on the use of species that are best adapted to environments where water stress is the main obstacle to overcome and have large seeds and seedlings with a large and deep root system. Characterizing underground seedling systems is essential for predicting the success of cerrado species in direct seeding."	36	1	0	0	27	3	42	2020-05-28	WOS:000533146900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Does the degree of urban development influence the abundance of groundcovers? Is there any relationship between slope features and the plant community of soil slopes?Location: Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.Methods: We conducted a vegetation study focusing on groundcovers on 35 revegetated soil slopes in urban and suburban areas of Hong Kong and determined differences in plant cover, diversity and community composition among areas under various degrees of development. We also assessed slope features, including presence of erosion control mats, canopy openness, slopes angle, area, elevation and substrate properties, such as soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and nutrient status, to examine their relationships to the plant community composition.Results: Plant cover was generally about 30%, with ferns having the highest cover. The initially planted groundcover species were replaced by native graminoids and ferns, or an invasive climbing herb, Wedelia trilobata. Soil slopes covered by erosion control mats had significantly lower plant cover than those without. Contrasting plant community composition of groundcovers was found among areas with different degrees of urban development and between slopes with and without erosion control mats. Slope angle, canopy openness, sandy soil texture and soil EC were closely associated with the plant communities of soil slopes.Conclusions: The current planted groundcovers used for revegetating soil slopes led to unsatisfactory plant cover but allowed colonization of other native groundcovers. Planting strategy using more adaptable native groundcovers, but not invasive species, is a feasible approach to ecologically restore soil slopes. The degree of development and certain slope features influence the plant community and should be considered in the revegetation of soil slopes."	11	0	0	0	6	0	11	2018-11-27	WOS:000450061000010	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Specifically, we tested whether missing soil seed banks, elevated soil nutrients and invasion by other non-native species explained the lack of recovery of native species.LocationBald-cypress-dominated (Taxodium distichum) floodplain forest. Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park, Alachua County, FL, US.MethodsWe assayed the plant composition of the soil seed bank to a depth of 5cm and analysed soil nutrient levels in a floodplain forest invaded by Ruellia simplex. We measured percentage cover of vegetation 1yr after herbicide application to control R.simplex.ResultsMany native species (largely perennials) and very few R.simplex emerged from the seed bank assay. Herbicide application reduced cover of R.simplex, but 1yr post-herbicide vegetation cover lacked native perennials, and instead was largely comprised of novel invaders and early successional (annual) natives. Across locations, levels of some soil nutrients (P, Mg) and pH were higher in R.simplex-invaded plots than in uninvaded plots. Similarly, R.simplex-invaded plots were significantly correlated with soil K and Ca levels at some locations but not others.ConclusionIt seems most probable that watershed-level factors, including soil nutrients and pH, as well as changes in hydrology are interacting with site-level factors, such as remnant invasive non- Ruellia simplex plant propagules and vegetative propagules of R.simplex to constrain long-term native plant community establishment. Propagule limitation from the soil seed bank is not likely a barrier to native plant recolonization in floodplain forests after removal of invasive R.simplex, as diversity and density of native species emerged from the soil seed bank was high and density of R.simplex in the soil seed bank was extremely low. It does seem likely that soil properties are influencing the plant community. A critical next step will be identification of native species tolerant of altered soil and water conditions if restoration efforts are to succeed. However, further research on all spatial levels is needed to effectively restore degraded floodplain forests, especially at the broader watershed level."	4	0	0	0	4	0	6	2015-09-30	WOS:000361181500015	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, biogeographical differences in plant communities may preclude extrapolation of these findings to other regions. The few investigations of such impacts elsewhere, including in Europe, have been strongly localised, restricting generalisations, and have not addressed community-level properties. Location: South and east coasts of Ireland (northeast Atlantic). Methods: We conducted a field survey of vascular plants and soil properties in fifteen salt marshes representing broad environmental gradients but comparable biogeographical settings, to test if salt marsh plant (a) diversity and (b) community composition are related to soil nutrients. Results: Species richness and Shannon diversity were both negatively related to soil NOx-, and Shannon diversity had a hump-shaped relationship to labile P. Multivariate community composition was highly significantly related to NOx-, to a lesser degree to P, and marginally significantly to NH4+. This was most clearly evident in the positive association of the ground cover of an evergreen dwarf shrub, Atriplex portulacoides, and a weaker negative association of a forb, Plantago maritima, with NOx-, indicating competition between these key and functionally contrasting mid-salt-marsh species. The relationship between community composition and P was most evident through the positive association of P with the invasive cordgrass, Spartina anglica. Conclusions: Physiognomic and functional differences between the herb-rich Pl. maritima community and monospecific A. portulacoides stands likely have implications for ecosystem services, as would a continued expansion of S. anglica. Further studies to ascertain causality could determine whether such transitions can be driven by nutrient enrichment."	5	0	0	0	5	0	5	2020-09-24	WOS:000498839100001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Mowing reduces biomass but is not widely practiced in conservation reserves because of concerns about facilitating exotic plant invasion and altering ecosystem function. We asked whether regular mowing affected (1) the diversity of native and exotic functional groups, (2) spatial turnover in vegetation composition (beta-diversity), (3) vegetation attributes relating to biomass and structural heterogeneity, (4) community composition and (5) the distribution and abundance of individual native and exotic species.Location: Five temperate grassland reserves, south-eastern Australia, encompassing C-3 and C-4 dominated communities.Methods: Vegetation within reserves had been cut to 10 cm, once per year, for 10 years in late spring/early summer to maintain access tracks. We surveyed plant communities in mowed areas and nearby (<5 m) unmowed control areas (40 subplots per reserve, 200 total) and used linear mixed-effects models to examine the effects of mowing.Results: Of 24 functional groups, the richness of 16 native and exotic groups significantly increased with mowing. In 14 of these cases, effects were consistent across C-3- and C-4-dominated grassland. Mowing reduced spatial turnover, but this did not reduce species richness at any spatial scale. When accounting for species abundance and evenness (Shannon diversity), effects of mowing were generally positive for native species and neutral for exotic species. Mowing increased native perennial grass cover and bare earth, decreased exotic perennial grass cover and litter, and changed community composition. Mowing reduced vegetation height but not structural heterogeneity. Mowing positively affected six individual native species and no exotic species. One native (Asperula conferta) and two exotic (Avena spp. and Nassella neesiana) species were found in lower abundance on mowed plots.Conclusions: Annual mowing can be a useful conservation tool for threatened temperate grasslands but should be heterogeneous to ensure the persistence of mowing-sensitive native species. Good vehicle hygiene is essential and localized complementary management (e.g., herbicide) might be required to reduce exotic forbs and grasses."	43	2	0	0	35	0	46	2018-05-08	WOS:000430912500005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Which vegetation attributes and disturbances specifically influence rangeland health?Location Northern temperate pastures in the Central Parkland and adjacent Boreal natural regions of central Alberta, Canada.Methods Plant composition and rangeland health data from 102 pastures were related to disturbance history acquired from retrospective producer surveys. Health assessments evaluated indicators such as vegetation composition, hydrologic function, and site stability. Producers were asked to identify pasture history (e.g., last cultivation date, whether fire had occurred), contemporary grazing actions (timing of use, grazing systems, type of livestock), and other management activities (i.e. herbicide application, manure spreading).Results Cultivation and burn history were the primary drivers of vegetation differences, where previously cultivated pastures were dominated by introduced, naturalized grasses, eliminating most native species. Remnant non-cultivated grasslands were occupied by a mix of native and invasive plant species. Grazing system had limited impact on vegetation composition due to uniformly high livestock stocking. Plant composition corresponded with gradients in rangeland health, where the latter declined with increased stocking rate and supplemental feeding on pasture. Greater health was characterized by increased cover of graminoids (primarily introduced forages), abundant litter, low plant richness, and reduced stocking rates. Other land management activities had comparatively less impact on the composition and health of these grasslands.Conclusions Conversion of native grassland and forest in this region has a strong legacy effect on vegetation.

In one population of each habitat type, we estimated electron transport rate and the level of plant stress (maximal photochemical efficiency Fv/Fm) by means of chlorophyll fluorescence.Results: Main shoots of Carpobrotus grew at similar rates at all sites, regardless habitat type. However, growth rate of lateral shoots was greater in shaded plants than in those exposed to sunlight. Its high phenotypic plasticity, expressed in different allocation patterns in sun and shade individuals, and its clonal growth which promotes the continuous search of available resources, contributed to a good growth and photochemical efficiency of Carpobrotus in the relatively moderate shade of the understories of Mediterranean shrublands and woodlands. Each main shoot of a Carpobrotus clone (which can have several dozens main shoots) grows ca. 40 cm per year, which explains its vigorous habitat colonization capacity.Conclusion: The highly plastic morphological response to different light regimes of this taxon contributes to a rapid colonization of heterogeneous coastal Mediterranean environments spreading well beyond the open sand dune systems where it has been often reported."	67	3	0	0	61	0	70	2008-02-01	WOS:000252958300006	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What are the spatio-temporal processes involved in pine invasions in contrasting Mediterranean and semi-arid climatic regions?Location: Mediterranean and semi-arid regions of Israel.Methods: The density of invading Pinus was measured in relation to the distance from the plantation edge. Plants were categorized by age, height, basal stem girth and developmental stage, their spatial distribution was also recorded.Results: Analysis of plant age distribution indicates that the invasion process started when the plantations were 20-25 years old. Most invading plants were found within 20 m from the plantation edge, but a few individuals reached distances up to 100 m and became new invasion foci. Plant density declined sharply with distance from adult trees, data showing a better fit to a power model than to a negative exponential model. Invading Pinus began to produce cones earlier in the semi-arid than in the Mediterranean region (9 vs 12 years to 50% reproductive plants). In both regions, higher densities of invading plants were found on the west side of the plantation, the opposite direction to the hot winds that prevail during seed release.Conclusion: The frontal advance of P. halepensis from plantations is relatively slow, but the populations also expand by a saltation process, creating spreading 'islands' of pine trees in the natural vegetation. Spatial pattern of recruits with distance from the source population was remarkably similar to the pattern of seed dispersal in the same region (Nathan et al. 1999). This implies that the probability of a dispersed seed developing into a plant is independent of the distance from the forest edge."	49	0	0	0	41	0	55	2005-05-01	WOS:000232547000011	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do the effects from the time since clear-cutting differ between forest and grassland plant species?LocationProvince of ostergotland, southern Sweden.MethodsTwelve contemporary clear-cut areas that were once meadows and 12 that were once forests were selected using land-use maps from the 1870s. Grasses and herbaceous plants were surveyed twice, once in 2009 and once in 2013 (2-4 and 6-8yrs after clear-cutting, respectively). Plant presence was recorded within 100 circular sample plots (radius 1m) placed evenly throughout each respective clear-cut area along transects spaced 25-m apart. The number of sample plots in which a species was present was taken as a measure of that species' frequency. Random effects meta-analysis, odds ratios and ANCOVA were used to analyse species responses to clear-cutting over time.ResultsA total of 170 plant species were found in the study, of which 33 were classified as grassland indicator species and 31 as plants primarily confined to forests. Clear-cut areas with a history as meadowland had, on average, up to 64% higher total species richness and 110% more grassland indicator species than did clear-cut areas with a history as forest. The time since clear-cutting had no effect on total species richness. However, the odds of finding a grassland indicator species decreased with the time since clear-cutting, whereas the odds of finding a forest species increased.ConclusionsWe concluded that land-use history plays an important role in explaining the flora found in Swedish clear-cuts, and that its effects on species richness remain for a minimum of 8yrs after harvest (conservative estimate). This phenomenon highlights the importance of acknowledging land-use legacies in ecological research and conservation. Future studies should investigate various options for the promotion of grassland plants in clear-cuts with a history of grassland management while also acknowledging the potential conflicts between conservation and production.

We repeated this survey in 2012/13, revisiting acidic and calcareous grassland sites (455 quadrats). Climate, N and sulphur deposition, cattle and sheep stocking rates, soil pH, altitude, aspect and slope were considered to be potential drivers of variation in vegetation. We analysed temporal changes in vegetation and examined relationships with spatial and temporal variation in driver variables.Results: Both acidic and calcareous grasslands showed clear changes in species composition between the two time periods. In acidic grasslands there was no significant change in richness but there were declines in diversity. There were significant increases in Ellenberg N. Nitrogen deposition and grazing were identified as potential drivers of spatial and temporal patterns but it was not possible to discriminate the respective impacts of potential drivers. In calcareous grasslands there were declines in species richness, diversity and appropriate diversity indices. Climate and soil pH were identified as potential drivers of spatial and temporal patterns.Conclusions: Despite only small site losses compared to other surveys in the UK, especially within the national park, both calcareous and acidic grasslands showed very clear changes in species composition. In acidic grasslands, high abundance of Pteridium aquilinum was a particular problem and had increased considerably between the two survey periods. Atmospheric N deposition and grazing were identified as drivers of species diversity.

Non-metric multidimensional scaling and. species area curves were used to assess changes in vegetation and the ability of invaded communities to return to 'uninvaded' states alter the senescence of Leptespernmum,Results: Shrub invasion did not lead to a decline in total species density. However, there was a significant shift in species composition, suggesting species replacement. Canopy gaps created by Leptospermum senescence had. significantly higher species density at a large scale of observation (256 m(2)), but tiot at any of the smaller scales. Species composition within Leptespermum gaps was initially highly variable and significantly dissimilar to that prior to gap creation. With increasing time-since-gap creation, floristic composition became less varied and more similar to the uninvaded state, but the oldest gaps were still compositionally different to the uninvaded state. These results were coupled with decreases in light, soil nitrate and soil moisture following invasion, and an increase in those variables following the creation of tree-fall gaps.Conclusions: Community composition was positively influenced by the creation of gaps within an otherwise shrub-dominated ecosystem. Gaps represent the removal of potential inhibitory influences created by the dominant species and permit the return of the system to that more similar the uninvaded state.

Is this rapid expansion an outcome of natural succession or is it driven by anthropogenic eutrophication resulting from atmospheric deposition? Location Salt marshes on four back-barrier islands, Wadden Sea on the coast of the Netherlands and Germany. Methods We used a combination of time series of vegetation maps and chronosequence data of four naturally developed salt marshes to address our questions. These salt marshes have not been grazed by livestock or subject to other management regimes. By comparing development within and between four different salt marshes, we were able to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of the community dominated by E. atherica on natural salt marshes. Results The expansion rate of the E. atherica community was highest on young salt marshes (up to 30yr old) with vertical accretion rates of 0.35cm center dot yr1. The rate of expansion decreased on older marshes and the direction reversed, becoming negative, on the oldest marshes (around 90yr old), which have no vertical accretion and are under waterlogged conditions. Conclusions The expansion of E. atherica on natural, back-barrier islands along the Wadden Sea coast is more influenced by the age of the salt marsh and patterns in vertical accretion of soil than by uniformly spread atmospheric deposition."	37	0	0	0	33	0	39	2013-04-03	WOS:000315690500006	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location The Transboundary W Regional Park, Niger, West Africa. Methods We focused on a protected savanna ecosystem with rainfall of 700 mm yr-1, where rainfall is not expected to be a strong limiting factor for tree cover, and with historically low grazer and browser densities. A burned area history map was created over 7 yr using the high temporal resolution Aqua MODIS space-borne sensor. In the field, the composition and structural parameters of the woody layer, as well as soil samples, were acquired in 137 plots of 0.09 ha each, based on a stratified random sampling approach to sampling the fire regime (seasonality and frequency). Using classical multivariate methods, we analysed the correlations between woody cover characteristics, fire regime and soil and geomorphological factors. Results In spite of management practices aimed at generalizing early fire every year, the fire regime created a diverse spatial structure, with some vegetation less prone to burning (fire-free) and other types that burned very frequently. These diverse fire histories showed correlations with gradients of both structure and composition of the woody layer. Soil variables had a higher explanatory power for vegetation structure and composition than fire. Conclusions Among the plausible causal chains between fire regime, soil factors and woody vegetation structure and composition, our results showed better agreement with a model in which fire regime is more a consequence than a cause of the other factors. This contrasts with bottleneck/perturbation theories as well as management practices, but meets the common sense opinions of field practitioners. Although our regional approach should be complemented by controlled experiments at a local scale, it does appear that investments in annual efforts to organize early fire campaigns in many protected areas may need to be reassessed."	18	1	0	0	14	0	21	2012-10-03	WOS:000308373500005	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To assess the spatial association between iceplant patches and the different cover types, we implemented an electivity analysis which analyses the frequency of common borders.ResultsThe mapped coastal dune cover types included beaches, dunes and sand plain variants, related to the typical Tyrrhenian coastal dune vegetation zonation. Iceplant-dominated vegetation presented elongated and irregularly shaped patches, which were not significantly different from most of the natural cover types suggesting a natural spread along the territory analysed. Iceplant patches were positively associated with beach, mobile and inter-dune cover types indicating that these habitats are exposed to further alien spread. Iceplant patches were also positively associated with artificial surfaces highlighting this cover type as a possible source of propagule pressure.ConclusionsThe proposed landscape approach combining patch-based metrics with edge-based metrics provided a comprehensive description of the invaded coastal landscape. From an applied research perspective, this landscape approach could be useful in identifying the correct management strategies for alien-invaded areas."	53	1	0	0	46	0	56	2010-04-01	WOS:000274819200001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We posed the following questions: Can savanna restoration outcomes be affected by the initial functional-group composition? Are there functional groups that, when established early, can prevent colonization by invasive grasses, trigger a successful restoration trajectory, and be used as early indicators of restoration success? Location Brazilian savanna (cerrado) in Central Brazil (14 degrees 07 ' 2.54 '' S, 47 degrees 38 ' 30.36 '' W). Methods We established 110 plots spanning a naturally occurring range of species composition in savanna areas that had been restored through direct seeding. We looked for different initial compositions of the following functional groups: perennial grasses, annual grasses, short-lived shrubs, and invasive grasses. We measured vegetation cover over two years and evaluated the effects of the initial functional composition on the successional trajectory of the plots. Results The initial dominant functional group determined the assembly trajectory. Short-lived and fast-growing species were replaced by perennial species, indicating a fast species turnover. Invasive grass cover remained stable over time, demonstrating that once they establish and dominate an area, an alternative stable state is achieved. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of introducing a mixture of functional groups when restoring savannas in severely disturbed areas. Fast-growing and short-lived species are important for quickly covering the ground, creating the conditions for the establishment of perennial grasses that naturally dominate the herbaceous layer of savannas. Trees are also characteristic of the savanna structure and must be introduced. Our results indicate that invasive grasses must be eliminated and/or constantly controlled before native species are introduced."	31	1	0	0	27	1	32	2019-03-11	WOS:000459825800007	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Are the observed differences due to the type of roadside (i.e. roadcuts, embankments or road verges) or are there other factors driving community structure and composition?LocationStretch of motorway A3 and its surrounding area, central Spain.MethodsWe analysed the variation in perennial plant species composition and diversity among 92 plots (400m(2)). The plots were located in five different environmental scenarios, three of them in a fragmented landscape (patches of natural vegetation, embankments and roadcuts) and two in an unfragmented landscape (natural vegetation and road verges). In each plot, the cover of each perennial plant species and eight soil variables were assessed. We used phi coefficient of correlation to determine the scenario preferences of each species, Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare the soil variables between landscape scenarios and eight descriptive variables of the community, and RDA and partial RDA to evaluate the relative importance of the type of environmental scenario on the floristic community.ResultsWe identified 130 species, with only 16 species never appearing on roadsides. Perennial total cover, species richness, inverse Simpson's index and number of protected species showed no significant differences between the five scenarios considered. In contrast, the number of nutrient-demanding species and restricted-range diversity had lower values in natural vegetation plots. Soil variables and the type of scenario together explained 28.5% of the species composition variation. Of this percentage, 6.8% was explained by soil variables, 12.1% by the type of scenario and 10.0% of the variation was shared between the two data sets.ConclusionsOur results show that almost all perennial species occurring in natural vegetation patches were also able to reach and settle in roadsides. However, soil conditions and other specific roadside variables generate different plant communities. In spite of the differences found between the perennial plant community of roadsides and their surrounding area, roadsides are excellent reservoirs of biodiversity."	27	0	0	0	23	1	35	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The number and composition of tree seedling emergents, the cover of herbaceous plants and the recovery of cardamom were assessed for 3yr.Results: Tree seedling recruitment was higher in plots from which above-ground cardamom biomass had been removed through slashing (meanSE per 5m(2); 28.9 +/- 2.70) and those where cardamom plants had been removed completely through uprooting (32.2 +/- 3.17), or when dead cardamom leaves and stems were removed with small-scale extraction of pods (22.5 +/- 2.16), than in unmanipulated control plots (16.6 +/- 1.13) over 15mo. The species composition of tree seedling emergents did not differ in response to removal of cardamom. However, the cover of herbaceous plants, including the non-native invasive Ageratina riparia, increased in response to removal of cardamom. Recovery of cardamom was higher when the plants had been slashed than when entire plants were uprooted and removed.Conclusion: Slashing or uprooting cardamom plants is a potential strategy for restoring tree seedling recruitment in forests with abandoned cardamom stands in the understorey, but these interventions would need to be repeated annually over many years to be successful, and they risk promoting expansion of the cover of herbaceous plants, including non-native species. Hence, this approach would be labour-intensive and costly. An alternative approach to promoting tree seedling emergence and establishment is to clear dead cardamom leaves and stems, and to encourage small-scale extraction of pods from the residual cardamom plants. Harvesting pods reduces the likelihood that the crop will be sustained in situ through natural regeneration, and supplies an income to local communities, which would enhance the social acceptability of the intervention."	2	0	0	0	2	0	3	2014-12-31	WOS:000345761800013	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Following the breaking apart of forests into smaller fragments or the afforestation of former agricultural lands, biodiversity experiences drastic changes due to species loss and turnover over time. This leads to two important outcomes, namely extinction debt and invasion (colonization) credit, which both reflect the inertia of the system's response to environmental changes. Our study investigated the following questions:center dot Is it possible to infer invasion credit from species-area relationship (SAR) residuals both for native and alien plants?center dot Is there any trend linked with the degree of habitat fragmentation through time?Location: Somme, Oise and Aisne departments, northern France.Methods: We analyzed the pattern of SARs' residuals for native and alien vascular plant species separately across nine sets of forest fragments that differ by the landscape matrix they are embedded in (i.e., open field, bocage, forest), while considering plant richness, area and age of the 355 forest patches.Results: The relationship between alien and native SARs' residuals is positive across all landscapes, suggesting a lack of invasion credit. Instead, these results support the rich get richer hypothesis, that is a high environmental heterogeneity allows colonization by new species, be they native or alien. Interestingly, the relationship between alien and native residuals depends upon fragment age (i.e., time since patch creation) in the most intensively managed landscapes (i.e., open fields). In the latter, recent forest patches are more prone to alien invasion, as a likely consequence of increased alien propagule pressure (i.e., more sources and vectors for alien plants), increased forest invasibility (i.e., disturbance-induced environmental heterogeneity), and decreased matrix permeability (i.e., natives are more dispersal-limited than aliens).Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into alien species ecology, by showing that (i) it is not possible to infer invasion credit from the SAR's residuals; (ii) the invasion rate by alien species in forest fragments increases with their native species richness, and (iii) this relationship depends upon patch age in intensively managed landscapes."	8	0	0	0	6	0	8	2023-08-26	WOS:001044692900001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Exotic annual grasses (EAGs) increase wildfires and degrade native perennial plant communities in cold-desert rangelands, and herbicides are thus sprayed to inhibit EAG germination and establishment. We asked how EAG target and non-target species responded to an herbicide mixture sprayed over a large, topographically diverse landscape after wildfire. We focused on how whole-community and natural EAG-pathogen treatment responses varied over years and physical properties of sites. Location Sagebrush steppe of southwest Idaho, USA. Methods We monitored plant cover and diversity in 41 pairs of plots located inside or outside areas (486 ha total) treated with a combined aerial broadcast spray of pre-emergent herbicide (imazapic) and weed-suppressive bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens, MB906) to target EAGs after wildfires. Results EAG cover and exotic species richness were initially less in treated plots but increased to levels similar to or greater than those of untreated plots by the third post-treatment year. The EAG pathogen Ustilago bullata was not directly affected by the treatment. The treatment increased exotic perennial forb cover in all plots and exotic annual forb cover in cooler/wetter plots but reduced exotic annual forb cover in warmer/drier plots. Cover of the invasive biennial grass Poa bulbosa decreased more across study years in untreated than treated plots. Among natives, the treatment reduced perennial grass cover and annual forb presence but led to marginal increases in perennial forb cover and, on soils with less gravel, increased shrub presence. Conclusions A treatment targeting a single plant functional group did not achieve lasting success in these diversely invaded communities. Spraying alone did not release native perennials sufficiently to counteract the simultaneous release of secondary invaders and the return of target invaders.

The contemporary framework incorporates processes identified by Gleason and other critics of Clements' theory.Multiple causality: The Clementsian causes, when expanded to include interaction and to clarify net effects, accommodate those now recognized in vegetation dynamics.A mature successional framework: A hierarchical framework has emerged to evaluate the causes of vegetation dynamics. The framework identifies the general causes as site availability, species availability, and species performance.Differentials as drivers: Differentials in any of the three general Causes can drive change in plant communities. Each general cause consists of specific mechanisms.A model template: To predict vegetation dynamics trajectories, models are required. A model template is presented to operationalize the hierarchical framework. Outcomes are contingent oil species pools and environmental contexts and may be progressive or retrogressive.Relationships of frameworks: Other contemporary frameworks in biology relate to vegetation dynamics.Application to restoration: The vegetation dynamics framework is relevant to restoration through linkages with landscape ecology, disturbance ecology, competition, invasion ecology, and community assembly.

Positive litter feedbacks of an introduced species reduce native diversity and promote invasion in Californian grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	20	1	NA	NA	28	39	NA	10.1111/avsc.12291	Article	JAN 2017	2017	"Questions: Californian grasslands have a long history of invasion, starting with the introduction of exotic forage species a century ago, and followed by newer waves of invaders. Both exotic and invasive species produce large amounts of litter, but the importance of litter accumulation on the growth and expansion of these species has not been rigorously assessed. We addressed the following questions: (1) do litter type (exotic or invasive species) and litter quantity affect exotic and invasive plant performance; (2) at which plant life stages does litter accumulation effects occur; and (3) is litter accumulation impacting native species recruitment and diversity?Location: Semi-natural grasslands, northern California.Methods: We created litter quantity gradients (0, 62.5, 125, 250 or 500 g.m(-2)) of three litter types (exotic or invasive species litter or a mixture of both). We evaluated litter effects on the germination, recruitment, production of flowers and biomass production of the exotic Avena fatua, the invasive Elymus caput-medusae and a mixture of native species. We used litter depth as a proxy for litter accumulation and measured litter impacts on light availability at ground level, soilmoisture, soil andmicrobial C and N.Results: We found a significant litter depth impact on all species, but no litter type effects. Litter accumulation principally reduced light availability at ground level and positively affected exotic and invasive species at different life-history stages. Above-ground biomass production of the exotic species Avena increased with increased litter depth, suggesting a litter accumulation feedback. The invasive species Elymus responded to increased litter with increased seed production, rather than biomass production. In contrast, litter negatively affected the recruitment and diversity of native species.Conclusion: Overall, our findings point to cascading effects in invasion with positive litter accumulation feedbacks of an exotic species simultaneously reducing native diversity and promoting seed production of a more recent invasive arrival. These results have strong consequences for invasion management and suggest that litter removal practices, such as burning and grazing, would better succeed at limiting the growth and spread of invasive species than herbicide application or seeding."	29	1	0	0	24	0	38	2017-03-30	WOS:000396473500005	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Were these differences consistent through time? Location East-central Arizona, southwestern US. Methods We used a multi-year data set from the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire to detect post-fire trends in plant community response in burned ponderosa pine forests. Within the burn perimeter, we examined the effects of pre-fire fuels treatments on post-fire vegetation by comparing paired treated and untreated sites on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. We sampled these paired sites in 2004, 2005 and 2011. Results There were significant differences in pre-fire treated and untreated plant communities by species composition and abundance in 2004 and 2005, but these communities were beginning to converge in 2011. Total understorey plant cover was significantly higher in untreated areas for all 3yr. Plant cover generally increased between 2004 and 2005 and markedly decreased in 2011, with the exception of shrub cover, which steadily increased through time. The sharp decrease in forb and graminoid cover in 2011 is likely related to drought conditions since the fire. Annual/biennial forb and graminoid cover decreased relative to perennial cover through time, consistent with the initial floristics hypothesis. Exotic plant response was highly variable and not limited to the immediate post-fire, annual/biennial community. Despite low overall exotic forb and graminoid cover for all years (<2.5%), several exotic species increased in frequency, and the relative proportion of exotic to native cover increased through time. Conclusions Pre-treatment fuel reduction treatments helped maintain foundation overstorey species and associated native plant communities following this large wildfire. The overall low cover of exotic species on these sites supports other findings that the disturbance associated with high-severity fire does not always result in exotic species invasions. The increase in relative cover and frequency though time indicates that some species are proliferating, and continued monitoring is recommended. Patterns of exotic species invasions after severe burning are not easily predicted, and are likely more dependent on site-specific factors such as propagules, weather patterns and management."	12	1	0	0	9	0	15	2013-07-10	WOS:000319885000011	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Methods We planted 62 3 x 3 m plots on compacted clay subsoil with 2021 replicates of three, 12 and 24 native species. Plots were sampled non-destructively using a stratified random point-intercept method each summer for 5 yr to determine number of species and percentage cover per species, which were classified as residents (planted), internal non-residents (planted in other plots) or external non-residents. Results A negative relationship between planted species richness and invasion developed by the fourth year after planting and strengthened thereafter. Plots consisting of a single, highly dominant, resident C3 grass species were vulnerable to invasion. With the exception of one species, which seems to have overcome resistance with a high seed rain, external non-resident species were less diverse and less abundant in higher diversity plots. Conclusions Increased planted species richness was correlated with increased resistance to invasion by non-residents, and we attribute this effect to a combination of the sampling effect and species complementarity, potentially augmented by high species dominance/low evenness in the low species richness plots."	28	2	0	0	27	0	35	2013-01-01	WOS:000312159400004	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Cover values for the invasive and recently evolved Spartina anglica were greater within regenerated than reference marshes.Conclusions: Salt marsh plants will colonise formerly reclaimed land relatively quickly on resumption of tidal flooding. However, even after 100 years regenerated salt marshes differ in species richness, composition and structure from reference communities."	67	1	0	0	56	0	75	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800006	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Indigenous and Ammophila arenaria-dominated dune vegetation on the South African Cape coast	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	2	2	NA	NA	157	168	NA	10.2307/1478979	Article	DEC 1999	1999	". Communities formed by the potentially invasive European Ammophila arenaria (marram grass) are compared with those dominated by indigenous dune plant species in coastal dune systems. Sampling of communities was carried out along the Cape coast for species richness, species diversity, importance values and species associations. The influence of soil and other environmental factors on vegetation were also compared. While species richness values in A. arenaria communities appear similar to those of indigenous dune plant communities, diversity indices are significantly lower. However, on the basis of importance values of individual species, A. arenaria does not show extreme dominance to the exclusion of other species, as it does on the North American Pacific coast, where it has also been introduced. Because of its growth in dense tufts, A. arenaria is accompanied mostly by small chamaephytes and therophytes, while indigenous stands support more phanerophytes. Moreover, A. arenaria forms weaker species associations than dominant indigenous dune plant species. The alien status of A. arenaria in South Africa is confirmed by applying classification and ordination analyses which failed to differentiate A. arenaria communities according to their geographical origin as achieved with indigenous communities. This may be attributed to the lack of vigorous indigenous plants in A. arenaria communities, which accounts for the low variety in species composition of A. arenaria communities along the coastline. With regard to environmental factors, A. arenaria communities were observed to be less sensitive to extrinsic factors, such as climate, than indigenous dune plant communities. Results confirm that A. arenaria is an alien plant species in South Africa, but do not imply its invasiveness in the present or near future."	9	0	0	0	10	0	12	1999-12-01	WOS:000208472100001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Understanding this is crucial for the effective conservation of grassland vegetation. We analyzed the factors affecting species richness to contribute to native species conservation and alien species management in grassland vegetation. Location Semi-natural grasslands in Shiroi City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Methods The species composition in 36 grasslands was surveyed in 2014. Plants were classified as native grassland specialist, other native or alien species. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were developed, with the number of species in each plant type as the response variable and local (habitat area, use of mowing management), landscape (adjacent land use, connectivity to other grassland habitats) and temporal (period for which the grassland has been preserved from development, i.e., temporal continuity) factors as explanatory variables. Other GLM were developed with the presence/absence of each species as a response variable and three factors as explanatory variables. Results Habitat area, use of mowing management and temporal continuity were most important in explaining the number of grassland specialist species and had significant positive effects on their richness. Species-based analysis identified a significant positive effect of temporal continuity on grassland specialist species. By contrast, habitat area and adjacent land use were most related to alien species richness. The number of alien species was high in grasslands adjacent to farmlands or roads. Conclusions The relative importance of temporal and spatial factors differs between native grassland specialists and alien species. Mowing is effective for the conservation of grassland specialists' species diversity, particularly in historically old grasslands. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the invasion of alien species from adjacent residential or agricultural areas."	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2022-09-23	WOS:000854868500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

A sixth Mediterranean-origin species (Spartium junceum) was also included since it is a common invasive in NW Europe and North America.Results: All five native NW European species displayed increased germination following thermal shock, even when seeds were heated to 110 degrees C. However, there was some variation depending on provenance: in contrast to seeds collected from southern England, germination of French C. scopiarius seeds was unaffected by temperature. Spartium junceum germinated most at 95 degrees C, but was the only species to show reduced germination when seeds were heated to 110 degrees C.Conclusions: The NW European Genisteae appear to be pre-adapted to the high temperatures associated with fire; a response attributable to their evolutionary origins in the fire-prone ecosystems of the Mediterranean Basin. Consequently, projected increases in fire frequency linked to climate change may stimulate their regeneration in NW European heathlands, potentially altering the species composition of these ecosystems. Additionally, a clearer understanding of the interaction between thermal shock and germination may explain why fire has so frequently been ineffective in controlling invasive Genisteae populations worldwide."	22	1	0	0	19	3	24	2009-08-01	WOS:000268571000012	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Cerrado biome (savanna), Brazil. Methods We tested four experimental setups by direct seeding: (1) native species only (control), (2) native species and green manure mixed in the same row (N + GM [mixture]), (3) green manure and native species planted in separate rows (N + GM [rows]), and (4) native species intercropped with wider strips of green manure (N + GM [strips]). We evaluated richness, seedling abundance, invasive grass cover, and cost-effectiveness 540 days (a year and a half) post planting. Results The N + GM (mixture) treatment yielded the best cost-effectiveness, highest species richness (three species) and seedling abundance (10,267 individuals/ha), along with the lowest invasive grass cover (50%). Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne and Astronium fraxinifolium Schott ex Spreng had the highest emergence rates across all treatments. However, green manure alone did not entirely prevent invasive grass, requiring further weed control. N + GM (rows) showed the lowest cost, but should be considered only with ongoing maintenance.

Our study investigated the following questions: Does a targeted grazing regime promote grassland functioning by clearing bare ground and reducing dead litter cover? Does targeted grazing reduce grassland fuels? Does targeted grazing promote native species cover and diversity? Does targeted grazing reduce non-native, invasive species cover and diversity?Location: The Santa Lucia Preserve, Carmel, California, USA. Methods: Monitoring grazed and ungrazed treatment plots within 17 study sites, we surveyed the effects of a targeted grazing regime on bare ground cover, litter cover and depth, herb height, and diversity and cover of different native and non-native species groups over an eight-year period.Results: On average, grazing successfully increased bare ground (by 2.8% cover), de-creased litter depth (by 3.5 cm) and cover (by 12%), and decreased herb height (by 3.9 cm). Grazed plots had greater cover of native annual forbs (+1.2% cover), while de-creasing invasive Bromus diandrus (by 6.0% cover). There was no difference in either native or non-native species diversity.Conclusions: Targeted grazing can be an appropriate tool to accomplish conservation goals, including biomass management and canopy clearing, while improving native annual forbs without risk to native species as a whole. Further steps in adaptive manage-ment must examine how the application of grazing may be altered to further promote native species and to inhibit invasive species."	4	0	0	0	1	0	4	2023-11-27	WOS:001028196500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Does soil disturbance provide potential opportunities to exotic invasions along elevational gradients? Does the established plant community after disturbance reflect the surrounding vegetation?Location Prealps, Italy.Methods To disentangle the role of elevation and soil disturbance in promoting exotic invasions, we performed a manipulative experiment along 12 roads spanning an elevational gradient of ca. 1,200 m. Additionally, we sampled species richness of native and exotic plants in the surroundings of the experimental plots.Results Soil disturbance reduced species richness of native plants, total plant biomass and vegetation cover compared to the undisturbed plots. The decrease in species richness of natives and plant biomass was stronger at higher than lower elevations, suggesting higher colonization opportunities for exotics. However, exotic species richness did not increase with disturbance, probably due to a low propagule and colonization pressure. We observed strong species replacement between control and disturbed plots, indicating that plant communities established after disturbance were not a subset of species communities already occurring in the surrounding vegetation.Conclusions With increasing elevation, disturbance had a stronger negative effect on native than on exotic species. Higher elevations, hitherto considered to have low invasibility, may provide new potential colonization opportunities for exotics but only if disturbance is coupled with an increased propagule pressure. Disturbance along roadsides promoted the establishment of species that did not occur in the surrounding vegetation."	12	0	0	0	13	0	15	2020-04-01	WOS:000522603200012	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Don on regeneration of native woody species in a semi-arid ecosystem? Location A semi-arid ecosystem in central Chile. Methods We sampled natural regeneration of native woody species in 40 plots in each of three canopy types: (1) under young adult invading trees of P.radiata located in formerly open (disturbed) sites; (2) in patches of native trees; and (3) in open (disturbed) sites, in two localities where this exotic tree is invading. Additionally, we carried out a field experiment in one of these localities; in eight of each of these canopy types we sowed seeds of ten widely distributed woody native species and monitored their recruitment. We also assessed different biotic and abiotic variables in these canopy types. Results We found that soil water content, depth and cover of leaf litter were higher and photosythetically active radiation was lower under P.radiata trees and native patches than in open sites. In the natural regeneration study, species richness of seedlings was higher in native patches and under P.radiata trees than in open sites, and total abundance of seedlings (including all species) was higher only in native patches than in open sites. In the field experiment, both species richness and total abundance of seedlings were higher in native patches and under P.radiata trees than in open sites. Moreover, in the field experiment species richness recruiting in native patches was higher than under P.radiata trees. Conclusions We suggest that native patches as well as P.radiata trees invading open sites facilitate or have the potential to facilitate regeneration of native species, although facilitation produced by native trees was stronger than that produced by P.radiata. Thus, in sites where nurse plants are not available, invasion by this exotic tree may be exploited in restoration processes through sowing or planting native species under the canopy of invading young trees of P.radiata, eliminating P.radiata individuals after native regeneration has established."	48	0	0	0	37	1	59	2013-04-01	WOS:000315690500003	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Three research sites in the continental inland of West Greenland. Methods Based on spatially constrained clustering of 147 vegetation releves and 145 transect plots of plant communities, boundaries of altitudinal vegetation belts were assessed. Indicators for altitudinal sections were identified from 664 vegetation releves among vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens and plant functional types using indicator species analysis. The performance of different plant groups along the altitudinal gradient was visualized with response curves. Results Boundaries of altitudinal vegetation belts were detected at 400, 800 and 1175 m a.s.l. on north-facing slopes and at 450, 900 and 1250 m a.s.l. on south-facing slopes. The resulting four vegetation belts were well defined by 99 indicator species and nine indicator plant functional types. Species, plant functional types and vascular plant distribution types showed clear sequences along the altitudinal gradient, which partly resemble their distribution along the latitudinal gradient. Conclusions As an easily observable expansion of shrubs and a decline of mosses and lichens is expected, the boundary at 400/450 m a.s.l. is particularly promising for climate change monitoring. The anticipated replacement of numerous cryophilous by thermophilous indicator species, as well as an obvious shift of plant functional types suggest several monitoring options at 800/900 m a.s.l. The summit areas above 1175/1250 m a.s.l., having a discontinuous plant cover, are considered to be especially vulnerable to fast invasion by species of lower altitudes such as woody plants and sedges. Due to steep gradients and short migration distances in mountains, it can be assumed that these anticipated changes in the study area will be stronger and faster than the already observed changes along the latitudinal gradient in lowland areas of the Arctic."	9	2	0	0	4	0	10	2012-07-25	WOS:000305936800012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We used a multi-model inference approach to explore the relationships between species diversity and landscape variables (i.e. agricultural disturbance), testing the role of dispersal mode (i.e. biotic, abiotic) for both native and exotic plants. For each habitat and plant trait combination, distance-decay of similarity was assessed by regression on distance matrices.Results: Species diversity of exotic and native plants was related to the degree of disturbance (cover of crop) and proximity to disturbance (distance to crop), with different responses according to dispersal mode and habitat type. In most of the habitats, the number of species dispersed by biotic vectors decreased when disturbance was higher. We further found that in woods and hedgerows the interaction between disturbance and dispersal mode drove the exotic richness. Exotic species were less dispersal-limited than native species showing a weaker distance-decay of similarity.Conclusions: The spread of exotic species in semi-natural habitats was driven by agricultural disturbance at the landscape scale. The effect of disturbance on exotic species richness was further shaped by species dispersal mode. Most initiatives related to preventing and controlling invasions are conducted at the local scale, whereas the influence of the land-use dynamics in the landscape is seldom explored. Our contribution provides useful information to identify the most susceptible semi-natural habitats to exotic plant invasions according to intrinsic local resistance and large-scale processes such as invasiveness from the surrounding landscape."	30	3	0	0	27	0	33	2018-05-08	WOS:000430912500009	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is there a distinct influence of removal method on successional trajectories of post-treatment seedling communities?LocationMid-altitude inselbergs, Mahe, Seychelles, Indian Ocean.MethodsWe conducted two field experiments. First, to test the effects of four IAP control methods (cut, 5%, 10%, 15% Tordon 101 herbicide concentration) on ten woody IAP species, we treated a total of 320 adults and monitored mortality for 18wk. Second, we set up five blocks each with four plots (4mx4m) at three inselberg sites (N=60 plots) and recorded the response of seedlings, saplings and adults of all native and IAP species to four Tordon 101 (a.i. picloram and 2,4-D) herbicide and manual control treatments (cut, cut-stump, foliar spray, control) over 22mo. Treatment effects were analysed with GLMM models, and community responses were investigated with NMDS and multivariate ANOVA.ResultsThe first experiment showed that IAP mortality (98.3%) was similar across all three herbicide concentrations, but markedly higher than mortality of cut plants (42.5%). In the second experiment, abundance, but not diversity, of native seedlings declined with herbicide application in the first 6mo after treatment. Ordination analysis showed that seedling communities experienced high turnover driven by early successional IAP species and abundance, and that between-plot variation was determined by site-specific differences, with only a weak treatment effect. Foliar spray resulted in high mortality of native saplings (52.7%) and adults (18.3%), and both herbicide applications reduced adult growth over a post-treatment period of 12mo.ConclusionIAP removal controlled plant invasion processes and altered community composition in the short term, regardless of removal method. Post-treatment trajectories of seedling communities are determined by site-specific differences. Chemicals can strongly increase the efficacy of IAP control, but short-term detrimental effects on native saplings and adults may be expected. As re-invasion by IAPs is likely, a long-term restoration plan is required.

Are sedge communities associated with historical land use, abundance of an invasive species or different fire and grazing management regimes? How do sedge communities compare between reconstructed and intact grassland?Location: Grand River Grasslands; working tallgrass prairie in north-central Missouri and south-central Iowa (US).Methods: From 2008 to 2010, we surveyed the sedge species richness and measured canopy cover (an estimate of abundance) on 13 tallgrass prairie tracts, and measured canopy cover of an invasive C-3 grass, tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub). Flowering sedges were identified to species and associated with wetland indicator status (WIS) and coefficients of conservatism (CoC). We calculated mean WIS, CoC, species richness (observed and estimated) and diversity (1/Simpson's D) for each tract. We used linear mixed-effect regression and multivariate ordination to describe patterns of sedge abundance and community composition in terms of land-use history (previously severely grazed intact prairie; previously ungrazed intact prairie; and reconstructed prairie), tall fescue abundance and current management (patch burn-grazed, burned-and-grazed burned only).Results: On average, sedges constituted 20 +/- 0.01% of total plant abundance. Sedge abundance increased over time and was higher on intact prairie than on reconstructions, but grazing history of intact prairie did not affect sedge abundance. We observed 21 species that averaged moderate wetland affinity (mean WIS = -2.1 +/- 0.2) and moderate affinity for undisturbed habitat (mean CoC = 4.5 +/- 0.2 and 5.0 +/- 0.1) from Iowa and Missouri lists, respectively). Species richness, diversity and conservatism did not vary with land-use history, current experimental management or tall fescue abundance, although all three variables were associated with patterns of sedge community composition.Conclusions: Diverse and abundant sedge communities provide a substantial forage resource for early season grazing. Neither historical grazing nor current fire/grazing management affected sedge diversity or floristic integrity. These data suggest grazing and the degree of invasion do not necessarily degrade entire native plant communities - responses likely vary among plant groups - but land-use legacies have a persistent effect on sedge community composition."	4	0	0	0	2	0	4	2015-04-29	WOS:000352131500006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In this review, we analyze the impact of pastoralism on biodiversity and ecosystem services across the tropical Andes. This region is the most extensive and populated tropical mountain region in the world and presents a high diversity of biomes, livestock types and management histories. Given that pastoralism is a main land use here, understanding its impacts is important for providing appropriate recommendations for sustainable management.LocationTropical Andes; Venezuela to the north of Argentina and Chile.MethodsTo understand these impacts, we performed a systematic literature search (August 2021) and obtained 103 articles. We created a conceptual framework to map how available research has contributed to our understanding of the main pastoral systems, their associated management strategies and the impact of different grazing intensities on vegetation cover/diversity and ecosystem services.ResultsWe found that research has focused on two leading pastoral systems in the region: bovines in the p & aacute;ramo biome of the northern Andes and camelids in the puna biome of the central Andes. We found important environmental impacts at high grazing intensities for both the puna camelid and p & aacute;ramo bovine pastoral systems, including a decrease in soil organic carbon and an increase in soil compaction, a decrease in above-ground biomass, plant species richness, and graminoid cover, as well as clear changes in the growth-form composition of vegetation.ConclusionsGiven these findings, we recommend coordinated research efforts using common methodologies, documenting current and previous land use, including stocking rates, and combining observational and experimental approaches to develop a more integrated understanding of pastoralism's impacts across this diverse and vulnerable region.The Andes is the most extensive and populated tropical mountain region in the world.

However, the long-term efficacy of this practice, its non-target effects on native plants, and its role in facilitating secondary invasions are not well understood. Similarly, little is known about the extent to which herbicide drift may affect native plant communities.Location: Foothills grasslands of Montana, USA.Methods: We conducted a 6-year experiment to investigate changes in the abundance of a target invasive plant, knapweed (Centaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos) and plant community structure in response to the herbicides Tordon (R) (picloram) and Milestone (R) (aminopyralid), applied at a recommended rate and a diluted rate that simulated drift.Results: Knapweed cover and the richness of native and non-native forb species declined in the first 3 years in response to treatment at recommended rates, but not drift rates. Secondary invasion by non-native monocots was significant but weak. The cover of native forbs and the cover and richness of native monocots did not differ among treatments but changed significantly with the year. Surprisingly, 6 years after treatments, there were no differences among treatments in the cover of the target invasive plant or community structure.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the efficacy and non-target effects of herbicides in grassland restoration can be short-lived and idiosyncratic because of year effects. Restoration of knapweed invasions might require other active interventions, such as seeding or repeated spraying. Our study supports previous calls for long-term monitoring of herbicides application in ecological restoration."	2	0	0	0	1	0	2	2023-08-18	WOS:001041419500001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Our aim was to reveal how the species' increasing abundance affects functional diversity and the ecosystem service-provisioning capacities of plant communities in both ranges. Location Sand grasslands in the Kiskunsag, Hungary and in Montana, USA. Methods All vascular plant species and their relative abundances were recorded in a stratified random manner in 1 m x 1 m plots in each range, using the following cover categories of Sporobolus as strata: 1%-25%, 26%-50%, 50%-75%, and 75%-100%. The functional characteristics of the plant communities in the two continents were compared. We performed comparisons of the communities both with and without including Sporobolus. Results Increasing Sporobolus cover resulted in a lower functional diversity and species richness, reduced average specific leaf area and increased the height of whole plant communities in both ranges but these effects were significantly stronger in the non-native stands. Sporobolus also negatively affected the cover of insect-pollinated plant species and the proportion of native perennials, switching the rest of the community from perennial-dominated to annual-dominated. In plant communities without Sporobolus, increasing Sporobolus cover led to a higher specific leaf area and seed mass in both ranges, but average height was decreasing along the Sporobolus abundance gradient in the native range, whereas it was increasing in the non-native range. Conclusions The spread of Sporobolus, away from its native range, leads to the impoverishment of host communities and compromises the biomass and floral resource-provisioning capacity of the vegetation to higher trophic levels. Tackling the spread of this new invader should therefore be a priority task."	8	0	0	0	4	0	10	2022-04-27	WOS:000782645900001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Post-fire succession of seeding treatments in relation to reference communities in the Great Basin	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	25	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12633	10.1111/avsc.12633	Article	JAN 2022	2022	"Questions Post-fire seeding has been widely implemented in the semiarid Great Basin because natural vegetation recovery may be compromised. Non-native species are often seeded to rapidly establish perennial cover and compete with invasive annuals. We asked whether seeding treatments with different amounts of native and non-native species followed different successional trajectories and whether they became more similar to reference communities over time. We considered restoration implications of seed mix choices and reference community options involving: (a) local unburned vegetation; and (b) reference states mapped by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) based on soil-vegetation associations. Location Tintic Valley, UT, USA. Methods Four post-fire seeding treatments differing by seed mix were installed alongside an unseeded control (USC) at two sites. Two seed mixes were comprised of native species and two were predominantly non-native. Vegetation was monitored 1-3 and 16-18 years after fire and seeding. Reference communities were characterized and compared using hierarchical clustering. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutation tests were used to determine successional trajectories of post-fire treatments in relation to reference communities. Results Local unburned reference communities had fewer herbaceous perennials and higher woody cover than NRCS reference communities, suggesting departure from conditions expected under minimal post-settlement disturbance. USCs became more similar to reference communities over time, though less so at a site with abundant invasive annuals. Trajectories of seeded treatments were driven by seed mix species, with native-only mixes approaching reference communities more closely than mixes with non-natives. Conclusions Gradual recovery of reference community composition is possible without seeding but the degree and rate of recovery can vary by site. Seeding can accelerate perennial vegetation recovery but may result in alternative successional trajectories, especially if non-native species are seeded. Carefully selected reference communities can serve as guides for formulating seed mixes when restoration of natural vegetation is desired."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000003	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Study sites included natural plots without effects of alien plants, ginger plots with a H. gardnerianum-dominated herb layer and cleared plots treated with herbicide to remove alien plants.Methods: Counting mature trees, saplings and seedlings of native and alien plant species. Using non-parametric H-tests to compare impact of H. gardnerianum on the structure of different sites.Results: Results confirmed the hypothesis that H. gardnerianum has negative effects on natural forest dynamics. Lower numbers of native tree seedlings and saplings were found on ginger-dominated plots. Furthermore, H. gardnerianum did not show negative effects on the invasive alien tree species Psidium cattleianum.Conclusions: This study reveals that where dominance of H. gardnerianum persists, regeneration of the forest by native species will be inhibited. Furthermore, these areas might experience invasion by P. cattleianum, resulting in displacement of native canopy species in the future, leading to a change in forest structure and loss of other species dependent on natural rainforest, such as endemic birds. However, if H. gardnerianum is removed the native Hawaiian forest is likely to regenerate and regain its natural structure."	26	0	0	0	29	0	39	2010-02-01	WOS:000273601700001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We directly measured vegetation and environmental variables within 34 sampling subplots and quantified the amount of tree cover surrounding our plots using digital color aerial photography.Results: Simple bivariate correlations revealed that high species richness and a high proportion of herbs were associated with low Lonicera japonica cover, moist and sandy uncompacted soils, low disturbance in the surrounding landscape, and periodic prescribed burning. Partial correlations and factor analysis showed that once we accounted for the environmental factors, L. japonica cover was the least important predictor of composition and among the least important predictors of species richness. Hence, much of the negative correlation between native species diversity and this invasive species was explained by soil texture and local and landscape-level land-use practices.Conclusions: We conclude that negative correlations between the abundance of invasive species and native plant diversity can occur in landscapes with a gradient of human disturbance, regardless of whether there is any negative effect of invasive species on native species."	23	0	0	0	19	0	32	2008-04-01	WOS:000255229600007	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Two potential drivers of biotic resistance that restoration practitioners can manipulate are native plant diversity and seeding density. Here we examined the effects of native plant species identity, native functional evenness, native seeding density and presence of Phragmites australis (a prolific invader in North America) on the growth of native species and invasion resistance to P. australis. Methods: We conducted two greenhouse experiments. In the first, native wetland species were grown in monoculture at one of two native seeding densities (1,938 pure live seed (PLS) per m2 or 9,688 PLS/m2) with or without P. australis. In the second experiment, native wetland species were grown in mixtures that differed in functional evenness at two levels of native seeding density (1,938 PLS/m2 or 9,688 PLS/m2) with or without P. australis. Results: The results of these experiments show certain high- performing species drove final native and P. australis growth when tested individually, even overriding any effect of the functional evenness treatment when grown in mixtures. In addition, we found the effect of P. australispresence on native growth differed depending on the native identity and the growth metric measured (biomass, cover or intrinsic rate of growth). Finally, a higher native seeding density increased native growth and reduced P. austra-lis growth, with the growth rate analysis yielding important insights into which species achieved these results fastest. Conclusions: Our results have three important implications for wetland restoration: (a) prioritize high- performing native species for invasion resistance rather than necessarily focusing on functional diversity; (b) account for the fact that native species will vary in their performance, often in unexpected ways, under different contexts; and (c) seed at a high native seeding density, potentially orders of magnitude higher than cur-rent restoration practice, to sufficiently increase native growth and biotic resistance."	3	0	0	0	3	0	3	2024-09-29	WOS:001318763700001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Patches of forest are scattered in the steppe matrix. At the local scale, each forest patch shows a climatic gradient from patch centre to its edge and to the open steppe. How do these climatic gradients determine plant species distribution for the forest and steppe within this ecotone?Location: The temperate forest-steppe ecotone in northern China.Methods: Species were recorded in paired plots of forest and steppe at 68 sites. t-tests were conducted to show differences in floristic composition among forest types. Mantel tests were applied to correlate site-level floristic distances with geographic and climatic distances for forest and steppe separately as well as for their combination. Floristic differences between paired plots of forest and steppe at each site were correlated to MAT, MAP and geographic factors at that site.Results: There was no significant floristic difference in the understorey of forests dominated by Betula platyphylla, B.dahurica or Populus davidiana. Quercus mongolica forests, however, were floristically dissimilar to the other forest types. Floristic distance of both forests and steppes were significantly correlated with MAT and geographic distance, while there was a significant correlation with MAP for forests only, but not for steppes. The floristic difference between forest understorey and steppe plots within each site showed no significant correlations with climatic or geographic factors.Conclusions: The plant species distribution of both forest and steppe was more dependent on temperature than on precipitation gradients.

Treatments aimed to reduce seed banks and modify establishment conditions of exotic annual grasses, and to exhaust vegetative reserves of exotic perennial grasses. Treatments were applied to three grassland patch types, dominated by the native grass Austrodanthonia caespitosa, ubiquitous exotic annuals, or the common exotic perennial grass Paspalum dilatatum.ResultsThe dominant native grass Austrodanthonia caespitosa and native forbs were resilient to repeated fires, and target exotic annuals and perennials were suppressed differentially by autumn and spring fires. Exotic annuals were also suppressed by drought, reducing the overall treatment effects but indicating important opportunities for restoration. The initially sparse exotic geophyte Romulea rosea increased in cover with fire and the impact of this species on native forbs requires further investigation. There was minimal increase in diversity of subsidiary natives with fire, probably owing to lack of propagules.ConclusionsWhile fire is often considered to increase ecosystem invasibility, our study showed that strategic use of fire, informed by the relative responses of available native and exotic taxa, is potentially an effective step towards restoration of weed-invaded temperate eucalypt woodlands."	19	0	0	0	18	0	19	2009-10-01	WOS:000269455100005	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In the Seychelles the endemic palm Phoenicophorium borsigianum and the aggressively invasive alien Cinnamomum verum are competitors in a series of habitats. The extent to which demographic variables (relative growth rates of leaf area (RGRAL) and height (RGRR) together with mortality and recruitment) were important determinants of the competitive ability of the above species was investigated. It was studied whether competitive relations between Cinnamomum and Phoenicophorium can change with light intensity as a result of different morphological responses and to what extent native plants such as Phoenicophorium can establish, regenerate and potentially outcompete Cinnamomum in important biodiversity sites in mountain mist forest and intermediate forest habitats. The light intensity in terms of diffuse site factors (DifSF) was estimated at 32 microsites from hemispherical photographs using a computerized image analysis system. A new plant growth analysis function, the so-called leaf area height index (ALHI), has been introduced and a principal components analysis (PCA) was carried out to evaluate the seedling performance of Cinnamomum and Phoenicophorium. Competition between Cinnamomum and Phoenicophorium was greatly influenced by the amount of available photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). For both species there was a negative correlation between mean leaf area of seedlings and light levels. Phoenicophorium responded significantly better in terms of RGRAL and ALHI to low gap light levels than Cinnamomum. Both species showed no further response to direct sunlight with levels of 98.7 % diffuse site factor. Phoenicophorium and probably other palms endemic to the Seychelles such as Deckenia nobilis and Roscheria melanochaetes act as a filter affecting the distribution and abundance of establishing Cinnamomum seedlings. Mortality of Cinnamomum was strongly negatively correlated with levels of PAR while Phoenicophorium showed no such correlation. Unlike Phoenicophorium, Cinnamomum could establish and regenerate only in light levels of >7.5 % diffuse site factor."	8	0	0	0	9	0	10	1999-05-01	WOS:000208472000005	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, there are few studies investigating non-target effects or rates of reinvasion, particularly over multi-year time frames. The aims were to evaluate the effectiveness of aerial application of glyphosate for control of dense stands of the invasive grey willow Salix cinerea, and determine the vegetation trajectory over the subsequent 2yr.LocationWhangamarino Wetland, Waikato, New Zealand.MethodsA before-after control-impact (BACI) experiment was conducted in a Ramsar-listed wetland in New Zealand. Effects on S. cinerea cover, canopy light interception and non-target damage were monitored over a 7.1ha experimental area prior to, and for 2yr following, aerial application of glyphosate. Vegetation classification, ordination and species richness analyses were undertaken to describe community-level effects.ResultsAerial application of glyphosate to an established willow canopy was effective in reducing cover to <5% on average for up to 2yr post-spray when assessed using 100m(2) vegetation survey plots. Smaller 1m(2) plots were more sensitive for detecting willow reinvasion, which was noted from 1yr post-spray. Collateral damage to non-target sub-canopy species was generally minimal, except for the native tree fern Dicksonia squarrosa, which showed marked reductions in cover and no recovery over the study period. Species richness was higher in sprayed plots post-spray and a shift towards a native Carex-dominated sedgeland community was detected.ConclusionsAerial application of glyphosate to a dense canopy of mature willow was effective in reducing the cover and dominance of this invasive wetland tree species. Minimal collateral damage occurred, facilitating recovery and expansion of a native sedgeland community. The risk of secondary invasion did not eventuate, although exotic species richness spiked in the year following spraying. Sedgelands are susceptible to willow reinvasion via seed, so longer-term trajectories will diverge depending on management intensity. Using currently available tools, the management options are either repeated cycles of herbicide application to redirect the trajectory from reinvasion to short-statured sedgelands, or intensive initial management to establish an alternative, more resilient trajectory to native wetland forest."	15	1	0	0	11	0	17	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700009	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Successional divergence was observed after approximately 130 years in the composition of the herb layer in the closed pine forest. The obvious vegetation heterogeneity in the still active sand-blown area is related to differences in timing of vegetation establishment on particular relief types, thus the succession exhibits a terrain-dependent asynchronous character.

This could result in dissimilarity in floristic composition between the above-ground vegetative community and the soil seed bank, causing abrupt plant community shifts following disturbance. Therefore, we asked what is the relationship in the floristic composition between the above-ground communities and the soil seed bank in sites where the threatened Ivesia webberi occurs?Location The Great Basin Desert, United States.Methods We used Dice-Sorensen's similarity index to estimate similarity between the standing vegetation and the soil seed bank.

Most of the dominant native plant species sampled in the standing vegetation were absent in the soil seed bank, and the soil seed bank was dominated by invasive alien weeds.Conclusions Divergence in the floristic composition between the above-ground communities and the soil seed bank in Ivesia webberi habitat indicates low resilience and high risk of native species loss following perturbation. Post-disturbance succession in these plant communities may be largely dominated by invasive annual species; therefore, reduction of invasive species and native plant seeding may be necessary to sustain the ecological legacies of the desert ecosystem."	7	0	0	0	5	0	8	2020-12-11	WOS:000593469100001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The invasive species involved may be introduced, or native invaders, and controlling them is a major global challenge. Here, we highlight an emerging role for native parasitic plants in suppressing invasive species, thus aiding in restoration of affected habitats. Compelling empirical evidence is provided by three study systems located in Central Europe, southern Australia and eastern China. Further cases of parasitism of invasive plants have been recorded across five continents. We propose including the interactions between parasitic and invasive plants into the theoretical framework of the biotic resistance hypothesis concerning generalist interactions between invaders and native biota. Among parasitic plants, numerous root hemiparasites, mistletoes and parasitic vines show low host specificity and exert substantial negative effects on their hosts. These parasitic plants may interfere with key traits of invaders such as symbiotic nitrogen fixation or clonal propagation which provide them with competitive advantage over native species. We contend that some parasitic plants may present a cost-effective environmentally sustainable component of invasion management schemes. Therefore, we encourage exploration of this potential and the development of methods for practical applications in ecological restoration and nature conservation."	27	0	0	0	23	0	28	2020-06-15	WOS:000537319300001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In each grassland type, one plot was located in a region with remnant grassland cover <30% (not conserved landscapes) and another in a region with remnant grassland cover >60% (conserved landscapes), in a paired design. In each plot, we surveyed the presence and cover of the four most important invasive species of grasslands in Rio Grande do Sul (Cynodon dactylon, Eragrostis plana, Senecio madagascariensis and Ulex europaeus). We used 12 variables related to climate and landscape structure (i.e. composition and configuration) for testing causal models of plant invasion using Akaike's information criterion for path analyses.ResultsEmpirical evidence on how climatic conditions and landscape structure can cause plant invasion in subtropical grasslands was provided through six causal models validated with path analysis. The models indicated that increased water deficit, higher density of roads and losses in natural grassland cover caused an increment of invasive plant cover. Further, invasion differed between plots located in conserved vs not conserved landscapes, resulting in not conserved grasslands having a higher level of invasion. E.plana, a perennial grass from South Africa, was the most important invasive species in the grasslands, in terms of frequency and cover.ConclusionsOur results identified the general conditions that promote successful population growth of invasive plants in subtropical grasslands: water deficit, road density and land use, highlighting the effects of climate, landscape structure and human activity in the level of invasion across grassland types."	54	0	0	0	50	3	58	2016-10-01	WOS:000386136600007	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How does the establishment of dominant old-field and prairie grasses with different functional traits affect community invasibility and soil nitrogen (N) cycling in abandoned agricultural fields?Location: W.K. Kellogg Biological Station, Hickory Corners, Michigan, USA.Methods: We established seedlings of several common old-field and prairie grasses in a Trait Assessment Study to determine the magnitude of species differences in traits expected to influence community invasibility and soil processes. We also established monocultures of these species in a field experiment to determine how species with particular traits impacted community invasibility and soil processes 2 and 4yr after restoration.Results: The prairie species consistently produced more shoot, root and litter biomass, and had more recalcitrant tissue than the old-field species, and there were corresponding differences in invasibility and nutrient cycling. Soils under the three prairie grasses had significantly lower inorganic N after 2yr and significantly lower potential N-mineralization after 4yr. The prairie plots also had significantly less invasion than the old-field plots after 4yr. Plots dominated by the old-field species had higher biomass of non-native species, and higher numbers of colonizing species than plots dominated by prairie species.Conclusions: Restoration using prairie grasses with particular effect traits can reduce N cycling and availability, and lead to a decrease in invasion by undesirable species from adjacent unrestored sites."	10	0	0	0	10	0	12	2015-01-01	WOS:000345761800011	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do standard or custom fuel models used in fire behaviour models with in situ or remote automated weather stations (RAWS) measured fuel moistures affect the accuracy of predicted fire behaviour in grass-invaded tropical shrublands?LocationHawai'i Volcanoes National Park, Hawai'i, USA.MethodsPre-fire fuel loads of coarse woody debris, live herbaceous and live woody fuel loads were quantified with Brown's transects and biomass sampling to create a custom fuel model for non-native grass-invaded tropical dry shrublands in Hawai'i. In situ fuel moistures were quantified using oven-dried vegetation samples, and compared to RAWS estimated fuel moistures. Fire behaviour was recorded on a stationary video camera to quantify flame length (FL) and rate of spread (ROS). Observed fire behaviour was compared to BehavePlus predicted fire behaviour parameterized with both standard and customized fuel models, and in situ and RAWS-based estimates of fuel moisture.ResultsThe custom fuel model and measured fuel moistures performed better than most standard models, but over-predicted actual ROS and top decile FL by 29% and 26%, respectively. The best match between observed and modelled fire behaviour came from a standard fuel model for shrublands with a grassy matrix (23% under-prediction for ROS and 9% under-prediction for FL) using measured fuel moistures. Using fuel moistures and wind speeds estimated from the nearest RAWS station (5km from the fire) substantially decreased prediction accuracy of the custom fuel model and increased its relative error to 71% over-prediction of ROS and 45% over-prediction of FL.ConclusionsFire behaviour in at least some tropical fuel beds can be accurately modelled using certain standard or custom fuel models. Standard fuel models should not be applied uncritically to systems outside of North America, as our comparison showed widely ranging accuracy across six standard models. In addition, the current reliance on RAWS data for meteorological inputs to predict fire behaviour in the tropics, especially in the US-affiliated tropical Pacific, must be used with caution. Instead, field-measured fuel moistures should be used when possible."	4	0	0	0	2	0	6	2014-11-05	WOS:000342839200011	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

(2) What is the present composition of pioneer vegetation in active and more stabilized drift sands in regions with low and high N deposition? (3) What efforts are necessary to conserve bare sand in drift sands? Location Eight inland dunes in the Netherlands, which represent four active and four more stabilized drift sands in regions with low and high N deposition. Methods Aerial photographs from 1950, 1981, 1995 and 2007 were used to compare rates of succession from bare sand towards forest. For each site, a detailed vegetation map was made in 2007. Results In all studied sites, bare sand decreased, especially in regions with high N deposition. This decline was significantly higher between 1981 and 2007 than between 1950 and 1981. The loss of bare sand did not lead to an increase of pioneer vegetation, which remained more or less stable; it led, however, to an increase of heath and forest. In active drift sands, pioneer vegetation was characterized by Corynephorus canescens and Polytrichum piliferum, while lichens, lichen-rich grassland and Campylopus introflexus were more common in stabilized drift sands. In regions with high N deposition, the proportion of Campylopus introflexus to older pioneer stages was significantly higher, and the contribution of forest to the heath/forest' vegetation class was also higher. The calculated life span of bare sand decreased in all sites. Extrapolation of the results suggests that in the absence of restoration measures, bare sand will vanish by 2035. Conclusions In both active and more stabilized drift sands, a generic loss of bare sand and an increase in forest area was found. The increase was higher in regions with high N deposition. Conservation management should include the annual transformation of 43ha of forest into bare sand in order to stop the loss of bare sand."	7	0	0	0	6	0	7	2013-07-10	WOS:000319885000004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Many local extinctions are concentrated in urban areas because of stressors such as habitat loss driven by land clearing and urban expansion, and the spread and increase in abundance of invasive species. We aimed to quantify the number of native plant species that have potentially gone locally extinct in a 20-ha conservation-significant urban reserve, assess which traits were more strongly associated with local extinctions and explore the factors driving these local extinctions.LocationWategora Reserve, Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.MethodsWe conducted an intensive, comprehensive botanical survey of Wategora Reserve across more than 300 h from 2020 to 2023. We compared our species list with a historical list spanning surveys from 1976 to 1992 and compared which native vascular plant species had persisted and which were not redetected, that is, possible local extinctions. We scored all species for seven plant traits and used Pearson's chi-squared tests to compare traits across persistent and extinct species.ResultsEighty-six of the 300 (29%) native vascular plant species originally recorded in Wategora Reserve from 1976 to 1992 could not be redetected from 2020 to 2023. Compared with persistent native species, native species that went extinct were shorter on average, more likely to have a graminoid growth habit and more likely to be associated with water.ConclusionsThese patterns were likely driven by synergistic stressors including urban stream syndrome and the proliferation of a few highly invasive non-native grass species, which are drivers common to many urban areas globally."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-08-23	WOS:001550491000001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

It consists of three modules. (1) The Vegetation module includes 149 phytosociological classes, 378 orders and 1305 alliances of an updated version of the EuroVegChecklist modified based on the decisions of the European Vegetation Classification Committee. Vegetation units dominated by vascular plants are characterized by country-based distribution maps and data on the dominant life forms, phenology, soil properties, relationships to vegetation regions, elevational vegetation belts and azonal habitats, successional status, and degree of naturalness. A list of diagnostic taxa is also provided for each class. (2) The Habitats module includes vascular-plant-dominated terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitat types from the first to the third or fourth highest hierarchical levels of the EUNIS classification. Of these, 249 vegetated habitats are characterized by a brief description, a point-based distribution map, diagnostic, constant, and dominant taxa, and a list of the corresponding alliances. (3) The Species module provides information on 37 characteristics of European vascular plant species and some infrageneric or infraspecific taxa, including functional traits (habitus and growth type, leaf, flower, fruit and seed traits, and trophic mode), taxon origin (native vs alien), and ecological information (environmental relationships, Ellenberg-type indicator values, disturbance indicator values, and relationships to vegetation units and habitat types). Values for at least three variables are available for 36,404 species. Individual taxa, vegetation units, and habitats in these three modules are illustrated by more than 34,000 photographs.

Location: Sandy region of Kiskuns & aacute;g National Park, Hungary, Central Europe.Methods: In ten old-fields, four 4 mx 4 m plots were established (n = 40), of which three were invaded by Asclepias, and one was uninvaded. The invaded plots were treated as: (1) all Asclepias shoots removed, (2) half of the Asclepias shoots removed, or (3) untreated. The treatment was conducted twice a year in summer during the period 2019-2021. Before the first treatment, soil and vegetation were sampled. Afterwards, vegetation monitoring was performed twice a year: the cover of each vascular plant species and the number of Asclepias shoots were recorded in each plot.Result: There were no differences in the studied soil attributes between the uninvaded and invaded plots. However, there were differences in vegetation composition, namely, the cover of sand grassland specialists was higher in uninvaded plots. Shortterm cutting negatively affected Asclepias after two years. The cover of specialists did not change in response to treatments, but the cover of other neophyte plant species increased.Conclusions: Based on our results, the invasion of Asclepias changes the vegetation composition, but not the soil. Although short-term mowing can reduce the cover of Asclepias, but the grassland specialist plants do not regenerate; instead, secondary invasion occurs.

This paper examined whether eradication of buffel grass infestations: (i) increases frequency, richness and diversity of native vegetation and seed bank pools; and (ii) improves availability of seed resources for granivores. Location Alluvial ironwood/corkwood woodlands in arid central Australia. Methods We assessed differences in floristic and seed bank composition between buffel-infested sites and sites where buffel grass had been eradicated ca. 12 years previously. Plant species frequency data from nested-quadrat sampling were amalgamated into plant functional groups to examine their relationship to buffel treatment. A seed flotation method was employed to: (i) assess seed bank composition of functional groups at eradicated vs. infested sites; and (ii) test whether the mass of seeds available for granivores was higher at buffel-free sites. Results Buffel-eradicated sites supported richer and more diverse vegetation and seed banks across all functional groups except perennial grasses. The effect was strongest for perennial forbs, annual/short-lived forbs, and annual/short-lived grasses. The overall mass of seeds of non-buffel grass species was ca. 10-fold higher at buffel-removed sites. Numbers of seeds of species in the 0.001-0.009 9 g and 0.000 1-0.000 99 g size classes, both of which contain species with seeds consumed by granivores, were ca. 20- and 14-fold higher respectively at buffel-removed sites. Conclusions Buffel grass removal at localised scales provides islands of habitat with improved opportunities for native plant re-establishment and abundant foraging resources for granivores. Future research must disentangle the relative importance of dispersal vs. residual seed banks for community restoration after buffel grass invasion. Extended delays in eradication could allow seed bank reserves to deteriorate to a state that no longer permits regeneration."	18	0	0	0	15	1	17	2020-10-30	WOS:000578866100001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We designated 36 2 m x 2 m plots in patches of Asclepias. We seeded two native grass species Festuca vaginata and Stipa borysthenica in 12 plots each (a third of the plots was left unseeded). We applied repeated mechanical removal of Asclepias shoots on half of the plots for two growing seasons. The number and above-ground cover of the two grass seedlings were evaluated for two growing seasons.Results: The number and above-ground cover of Festuca and Stipa seedlings did not increase after applying Asclepias shoot removal during the 2 years of the study. We found lower seedling number and cover of Festuca in plots with Asclepias shoot removal in the second year, when a severe summer drought occurred at the study site. The number and cover of the Stipa seedlings did not differ between plots with Asclepias shoot removal and control plots throughout the experiment.Conclusions: We did not find any negative effects of the presence of the invasive Asclepias during open sand grassland regeneration in terms of germination and early establishment of the dominant grass species. We even detected a nurse effect of Asclepias on Festuca, where the shade of Asclepias may have mitigated the unfavourable abiotic conditions for Festuca caused by summer drought. This mitigation was not observed in the case of Stipa, which can better tolerate summer droughts. Our results suggest that Asclepias control is not required for a successful open sand grassland restoration in the early phase of vegetation recovery, and restoration efforts should focus on the mitigation of propagule limitation of native grasses. However, further information is needed about the effects of Asclepias on other elements of the biota and in later phases of secondary succession."	20	0	0	0	18	0	22	2018-10-01	WOS:000450061000005	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do these competitive intraspecific aggregations displace and exclude other species, thereby reducing species diversity?Location: Atlantic grasslands, Aralar Natural Park, Basque Country, Northern Iberian Peninsula.Methods: Large herbivores were experimentally excluded from three sites (50 m x 50 m exclusion fences) during 9 yr in a productive semi-natural grassland system with a long history of grazing, using adjacent grazed plots as experimental controls. Sampling was carried out by systematically placing 100 quadrats (0.5 m x 0.5 m) in each of the six plots. Floristic composition and abundance, as well as eight hydrological and chemical soil properties, were measured in each quadrat. The spatial structures created by competitive species were analysed using RDA in conjunction with Moran's eigenvector maps, and soil variables were simultaneously included in the analyses, thus disentangling the structures likely created by niche effects. Competitive exclusion was further determined using linear regressions between species richness and abundance of competitive species.Results: Grazing exclusion unleashed competitive species such as Festuca microphylla and Agrostis capillaris, which became dominant in the exclusion plots and created large spatial patches. Furthermore, a negative linear relationship, consistent across exclusion plots, was observed between species richness and abundance of competitive species, indicating that strong above-ground competitors outcompeted other species when herbivores were excluded. However, the outcome of grazing exclusion across sites depended to some extent on local environmental conditions (niche effects).Conclusions: This work confirms that the powerful equalizing mechanism of disturbance by herbivores is crucial for species co-existence in productive grasslands. However, important differences observed in environmental effects across sites suggest that, even in highly productive grasslands, plant traits and local environmental characteristics (niche effects) do matter for species co-existence."	21	0	0	0	14	0	21	2017-01-01	WOS:000396473500007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

For baseline vegetation reference, three open and three closed sand grassland stands in both regions were sampled in the vicinity of the old-fields. The percentage cover of vascular plants was recorded in five 2x2-m plots in each field, in early May and late June 2012. We used life forms, clonal spreading traits and Ellenberg indicator values for nutrients in the analysis. Species of Festuco-Brometea class were considered as target species.ResultsThe cover of hemicryptophytes and geophytes increased, the cover of short-lived species decreased with time. Cover of species without clonal spreading ability decreased, while cover of species with clonal spreading ability increased with increasing field age. The cover of invasive species decreased with increasing field age. The majority of target species had established already in the young and middle-aged old-fields, although their cover was significantly higher in the two older age groups.ConclusionSpontaneous succession can be a vital option in recovery of sand grassland vegetation in Central Europe; the majority of the species pool of sandy grasslands can be recovered in the first 10-20yrs. However, the success of grassland recovery can be strongly influenced by the surrounding species pool and can be slow if seed dispersal is limited. Spontaneous succession is most promising when the target species of grasslands immigrate at the very beginning of the succession, within the first few years."	72	1	0	0	68	0	84	2014-04-01	WOS:000332774800004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do invasive and exotic species, highly abundant in disturbed communities, regenerate better than native species after disturbance?Methods: Hand tilling was applied to three urban plant communities with and Without additional herbicide treatment to exclude regeneration from the bud bank. Plant traits were determined from the literature and databases. Species responses to the treatments were evaluated with RDA analyses ill CANOCO. Linear models were applied to identify traits that Could predict the responses of species to disturbance.Results: The bud bank played a key role in regeneration in the plots without herbicide. In the plots with herbicide treatment, the seed bank was important in re-establishing vegetation after disturbance. Exclusion of the bud bank by using herbicide allowed the establishment of small annuals, whereas biennials and perennials were Successful in plots where the bad bank was not inhibited by herbicide. Exotic species with a long residence time in the local flora were Successful in plots where regeneration from the bud batik was excluded, whereas species with short residence times or that were invasive were Suppressed by both types of disturbance.Conclusion: In response to various types of disturbance, species with different regeneration strategies (either seeds or bud bank) were promoted. Exotic species were suppressed primarily by disturbance, which suggests that factors other than just regenerative capability contributed to the high abundance of exotics in urban communities."	35	6	0	0	35	0	46	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800011	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

One promising approach involves introducing biochar to invaded plant communities to modify interspecific relationships among invasive and native plants, ultimately aiding in the suppression of invasive species. This study aimed to explore the effects of invasive-plant biochar on an established invaded plant community. Location: Tianjin coastal saline-alkaline wetland, China (38 degrees 46 ' N, 117 degrees 34 ' E). Methods: Invaded plant communities were established using soils from an Amaranthus palmeri-invaded wetland with an intact seed bank, incorporating invasive-plant biochar derived from A. palmeri and Spartina alterniflora into the soil at 0%, 1%, 3%, and 5% addition rates (m/m). Plant above-ground biomass, height, stem diameter, abundance, alpha/beta-diversity, niche breadth, and species co-occurrence networks were analyzed. Results: The addition of invasive-plant biochar significantly decreased the performance measures of the invaded plant community. The biochar addition rate had a more substantial impact on plant community structure than the type of biochar used. There was a decrease in the abundance of A. palmeri and an increase in native plants across most treatments, with S. alterniflora biochar exhibiting a more pronounced effect compared to A. palmeri biochar. Invasive-plant biochar affected the niche breadth of A. palmeri and other dominant native species, particularly at higher addition rates, resulting in reduced niche overlap. At a 5% addition rate, A. palmeri and S. alterniflora biochar had contrasting effects on the complexity of interspecific relationships within the plant community. Phylogenetic beta-diversities were significantly correlated with the biochar addition rate and stochastic processes primarily governed plant community assembly across all treatments. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the potential of biochar derived from invasive plants to mitigate the impact of invasive species on saline-alkaline wetland plant communities dominated by A. palmeri. This approach offers a promising avenue for managing biological invasions and restoring native plant species."	3	0	0	0	3	0	3	2024-08-23	WOS:001294054500001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Impact of plant diversity and management intensity on magnitude and stability of productivity in North American grazing lands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	27	2	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12776	10.1111/avsc.12776	Article	APR 2024	2024	"QuestionsGrasslands provide important provisioning services worldwide and their management has consequences for these services. Management intensification is a widespread land-use change and has accelerated across North America to meet rising demands on productivity, yet its impact on the relationship between plant diversity and productivity is still unclear. Here, we investigated the relationship between plant diversity and grassland productivity across nine ecoclimatic domains of the continental United States. We also tested the effect of management intensification on diversity and productivity in four case studies.MethodsWe acquired remotely sensed gross primary productivity data (GPP, 1986-2018) and plant diversity data measured at different spatial scales (1, 10, 100, 400 m2), as well as climate variables including the Palmer drought index from two ecological networks. We used general linear mixed models to relate GPP to plant diversity across sites. For the case study analysis, we used linear mixed models to relate plant diversity to management intensity, and tested if the management intensity influenced the relationship between GPP (mean and temporal variation) and drought.ResultsAcross all sites, we observed positive relationships among species richness, productivity, and the temporal stability of mean annual biomass production. These relationships were not affected by the scale at which species richness was observed. In three out of the four case studies, we observed that management effects on species richness were only significant at broader scales (i.e., >= 10 m2) with no clear effect found at the commonly used 1-m2 quadrat scale. In one case study, species-poor, intensively managed pastures presented the highest productivity but were more sensitive to dry conditions than less intensified pastures. However, in other case studies, we did not observe significant effects of management intensity on the magnitude or stability of productivity.ConclusionsGeneralization across studies may be difficult and require the development of intensification indices general enough to be applied across diverse management strategies in grazilands. Understanding how management intensification affects grassland productivity will inform the development of sustainable intensification strategies.Our study highlights the general but weak importance of plant diversity for productivity across grasslands in North America. Management intensification was a strong driver of diversity, but this effect was often only detected at larger spatial scales. Surprisingly, management intensification did not always result in greater plant productivity. In grazing lands where intensification contributed to higher ecosystem productivity, it was not necessarily associated with higher stability in productivity, emphasizing the need to develop alternative management promoting both high productivity and high stability, such as maintaining a combination of low-intensity pastures along with high-intensity-managed pastures.image"	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2024-05-24	WOS:001223903400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

A decrease in biodiversity and a loss of palatable species is also observed. The invasibility of the tall-grass mountain grassland community was investigated in an experiment of factorial design. Six alien species which are widely distributed in the region were sown in plots where soil disturbance, above-ground biomass removal by cutting and burning were used as treatments. Alien species did not establish in undisturbed plots. All three types of disturbances increased the number and cover of alien species; the effects of soil disturbance and biomass removal was cumulative. Cirsium vulgare and Oenothera erythrosepala were the most efficient alien colonizers. In conditions where disturbances did not continue the cover of aliens started to decrease in the second year, by the end of the third season, only a few adults were established. Consequently, disturbances are needed to maintain alien populations in tall-grass mountain grasslands. Burning also increased the species richness of native species. We conclude that an efficient way to control the distribution of alien species is to decrease grazing pressure while burning as a traditional management tool may be continued."	37	1	0	0	33	3	43	2002-12-01	WOS:000181162900005	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Because of their highly productive habitats and their dependence on hydro-meteorologic regimes, they are threatened worldwide by land use and climate change. In most wetlands, intensification of productive activities has been mostly accompanied by the implementation of a water management infrastructure, disrupting water and nutrient dynamics. Our aim was to analyze whether intensification of livestock raising erodes the structure and function of plant communities, as well as the quality and fertility of soils in wetlands. LocationNon-insular portion of the Lower Delta of the Parana River, Argentina. MethodsPlant communities were characterized on the basis of their floristic composition, structural and functional diversity. Soil samples were also collected to assess soil fertility, texture and quality. Generalized mixed linear models were used to contrast these attributes across livestock management practices characterized by differing water management infrastructure (polders and channelizations) and livestock type (bovine, bubaline). ResultsRemarkably fertile hydromorphic soils supported a structurally rich and functionally diverse species composition. Nevertheless, most dominant populations were terrestrial, perennial, invasive species, partially adapted to conditions of temporary flooding. Polderized livestock fields exhibited not only the lowest quality, least fertile, most compacted soils, but also lower species richness and diversity, as well as the lowest values in all non-redundant components of functional diversity. Channelized livestock fields exhibited lower species richness and taxonomic diversity as well as reduced soil quality and fertility, yet an overall increase in most non-redundant components of functional diversity. ConclusionsPromoting the loss of native flora, water management infrastructure impairs the sustainability of anthropic activities and thwarts biodiversity conservation efforts. Traditional and sustainable practices that embrace the periodicity of the flood pulse are required to preserve the taxonomic and functional diversity of plant communities, as well as the quality and fertility of soils."	5	0	0	0	2	0	5	2022-12-29	WOS:000898708600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Plant species richness and species composition were monitored for 3years at two sites post-fire and firebreak construction.ResultsBurned plant communities were resilient and had similar native grass cover and native species richness compared with the unburned sites after 3years. Soil disturbance from firebreak construction resulted in species composition that was distinct and had lower native grass cover. Type of disturbance also affected the community's resistance to B.tectorum. Bromus tectorum cover was similar in burned and unburned areas, but increased up to three times and remained high where soil disturbance occurred, suggesting a shift to an alternative state.ConclusionIn this northern portion of the sagebrush steppe, communities with native plant cover were resilient to fire but not soil disturbance, which facilitated B.tectorum increase and a transition to an alternative state.

What was the effect of the use of limestone gravel as road surfacing material? How did floristic succession vary between roadside and forest interior? Location State Forest of Orleans, Loiret, northern France. Methods We sampled 30 pairs of 2000-m2 plots, one on a road and the other 30m inside the forest, on two road surfacing materials (limestone gravel and bare soil) and three stand ages (young, middle-aged and mature) in Scots and Corsican pine stands in a large managed forest. Plant diversity was analysed according to life-history traits (protection status, indigenousness, life form, habitat and ecological preferences). We tested the effects of plot position, road type and stand age on species richness, species composition and individual species response. Results The species richness of all plant groups was always higher on roads compared to forest stands, and the forest plot communities were nearly completely nested within the roadside plot communities. Seven protected species and four non-native potentially invasive species were observed on roadsides. Limestone-gravelled roads hosted more species than bare soil roads, but acidophilous forest and grassland species richness was higher on bare soil roads. Plant composition similarity between the roadside and forest were higher at early successional stages and lower in older stages. Conclusions Roads have inseparable positive and negative effects on plant communities, but the negative ones are of great concern.

Within-and between-class dissimilarities were compiled for each level to elucidate species compositional patterns. Randomized subsampling was used to determine the minimum site sampling intensity for each hierarchy level, and the effects of lumping and splitting illustrated for several classes.Results: Consistent dissimilarity estimates were obtained with five or more sites per regional ecosystem, 10 or more sites per land zone, and more than 15 sites per subregion. On average, subregions represented 4% dissimilarity in floristic composition, land zones approximately 10%, and regional ecosystems over 19%. Splitting classes with a low dissimilarity increased dissimilarity levels closer to average, while merging ecologically similar classes with high dissimilarities reduced dissimilarity levels closer to average levels.Conclusions: This approach demonstrates a robust and repeatable means of analysing species compositional dissimilarity, determining site sampling requirements for classifications and guiding decisions about 'lumping' or 'splitting' of classes.

Variable effects of long-term livestock grazing across the western United States suggest diverse approaches are needed to meet global change challenges	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	26	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12719	10.1111/avsc.12719	Article	JAN 2023	2023	"AimsLivestock production is the most widespread land use globally and occurs across a diverse set of ecosystems. Variability in long-term livestock grazing impacts across ecosystems is poorly characterized, particularly at larger spatial scales, despite strong relationships with various ecosystem services related to soil fertility and stabilization and vegetation productivity. Here we examine the effects of grazing on vegetation and the implications for resistance and resilience to global change. MethodsWe use six long-term research stations in the western United States, spanning two ecoregions, multiple ecosystems, and 311 total site-years of research. Across these sites we evaluate convergence and divergence of vegetation response to grazing vs grazing removal, focusing on interactions with drivers of global change. ResultsWe found that at long time scales (multiple decades), grazing has numerous convergent and divergent effects across ecoregions and ecosystems. Similarity among precipitation patterns and plant traits linked to grazing and production timing were key elements explaining convergence or divergence in long-term patterns of livestock grazing response. Ecosystem differences across western US rangelands are also associated with variable effects of grazing on resistance and resilience to invasive species and climate change. ConclusionsThese results suggest that unique ecosystem or ecoregion responses to future global change may result from complex interactions between grazing and environmental factors, such as precipitation timing and plant traits. Adapting livestock and grazing management to specific ecosystem vegetation and climate variability is needed to manage for the myriad global changes affecting rangeland production and diversity."	9	0	0	0	5	0	10	2023-08-21	WOS:000956735500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Which are the main directions of change? Which environmental, management and landscape factors have determined these changes?Location: Central and southern Apennines of Italy.Methods: In 2013-2014, we used a stratified random sampling design to revisit 132 semi-natural grasslands originally sampled between 1966 and 1992. The exact locations of the historical plots were not available but they were associated with detailed vegetation maps. Plots were divided in 17 groups based on study area and original community type. To assess changes in species composition we ran PERMANOVA and RDA. The extent of change was estimated by comparing each new plot with the quantitative species pool of the corresponding historical group; species composition changes were calculated using Bray-Curtis coefficient, and shifts in functional traits were quantified as differences in community-weighted means. These measures of change were used as response variables in mixed effects models including climate, topography, management and landscape metrics as explanatory variables.Results: The largest changes were related to successional dynamics, which occurred mainly in grasslands developing at low altitude and in the flattest sites where the soil organic horizon was relatively thick. Colonization by shrubs and trees was facilitated by high soil pH and amount of adjacent forests. Also, management factors affected the patterns of shifts in species composition and functional traits: grazing intensity was negatively related to the degree of compositional change as well as to the abundance of woody species, whereas the increase of species associated with frequent grazing disturbance was found at sites with higher values of soil salinity.Conclusions: Apennine semi-natural grasslands have undergone substantial changes in species composition and functional traits during recent decades. Compositional changesmainly indicated successional dynamics, likely following a decrease in grazing intensity, whereas some more accessible grasslands experienced an increase in disturbance-tolerant species. The combination of the re-visitation approach with functional traits allowed us to clarify different directions of changes in species composition, adding information on the ecological processes related to these changes."	42	1	0	0	37	0	45	2017-04-01	WOS:000398083700010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The habitats were logging road, skid trail, large canopy gaps dominated by B. papyrifera, large canopy gaps dominated by invasive Chromolaena odorata, Nauclea diderrichii plantation, Mansonia altissima plantation, Terminalia ivorensis plantation, abandoned farmland and unlogged forest.Results: We found that the abundance of pioneers declined with increasing abundance of B. papyrifera. This trend was more pronounced in the farmland and in the N. diderrichii plantation. By contrast, increased abundance of B. papyrifera did not lead to a decrease in the abundance of the shade-tolerant species. B. papyrifera seedlings and saplings were absent in the forest understorey. We also found a lower abundance and richness of some vulnerable tree species and valuable timber species in the N. diderrichii plantation and in gaps dominated by B. papyrifera. However, we recorded both shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species in the gaps dominated by B. papyrifera.Conclusions: We found both shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species in the B. papyrifera-dominated gaps. This can provide a basis for future studies to explore the potential of such tree species in restoration programmes targeted at B. papyrifera-invaded sites. Our results also suggest that the integrity of the undisturbed forest patches in the landscape must be protected to help prevent B. papyrifera from spreading further.

Their transplantation success (survival, growth and reproduction) and their impact on their immediate vicinity (understorey composition, soil surface indicators, e.g. cover of moss, biological crust, bare ground, litter, herbaceous cover and soil characteristics) were assessed 4.5yrs after transplantation.ResultsWhile some transplanted species had low survival (<30%), half of them had survival of >78% 4.5yrs after transplantation. Plant growth was barely correlated with transplantation success in such a harsh environment. Transplanted species did not influence soil and understorey plant composition but significantly impacted soil surface indicators. The shrub species with higher survival usually allowed establishment of an understorey herbaceous cover, which may increase soil erosion control. This is also true for some species for which the survival was <40%: Diplusodon orbicularis (survival: 39%) and Lavoisiera campos-portoana (37%). Crown volume had a direct effect on light reaching the soil (e.g. Jacaranda caroba or Collaea cipoensis had a less dense canopy more permeable to light, allowing the development of understorey species). On the other hand, crown volume was positively correlated with amount of litter: Fabaceae, e.g. Chamaecrista semaphora and Mimosa foliolosa, had denser canopy and produced a thick layer of litter, limiting herbaceous species establishment. Three tree species (Enterolobium ellipticum, Kielmeyera petiolaris and Zeyhera tuberculosa) neither had high survival nor facilitated establishment of herbaceous cover. The layout and spacing of species and individuals must thus be considered carefully to ensure recolonization by native shrub and herbaceous species.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the practical efficiency of using some species native to harsh tropical ecosystems, e.g. Campos Rupestres, to restore quarry ecosystems in terms of their transplantation success, effects on both the establishment of herbaceous species and soil conservation."	47	3	0	0	39	3	49	2014-01-22	WOS:000328544400012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The effect of landscape isolation on colonization efficiency was evaluated for each guild by plotting local species pools against distance to nearby natural wetlands, and the relative importance of dispersal vs. on-site constraints in limiting colonization was explored by comparing the local species pools of restored and natural wetlands within the region.Results: Of the 517 wetland plant taxa occurring in the region, 50% have established within 12 years. The proportion of the regional species pool represented in local species pools differed among guilds, with sedge-meadow perennials, emergent perennials and floating/submersed aquatics least represented (33-36%) and annual guilds most represented (74-94%). Colonization-to-extinction ratios suggest that floating/submersed aquatics have already reached a species equilibrium while sedge-meadow and emergent perennials are still accumulating species. Increasing distance to nearest wetlands decreased the proportion of the regional species pool present in local pools for all guilds except native annuals and woody plants. The maximum proportion predicted, assuming no distance constraint, was comparable to the lowest-diversity natural wetlands for most perennial guilds, and also lower than what was achieved in a planted, weeded restoration.Conclusions: Abiotic constraints seem to limit the colonization of floating/submersed aquatics into natural or restored wetlands, whereas all other guilds are potentially constrained by dispersal or biotic factors (i.e. competition from invasive species). Using species pools to evaluate restoration progress revealed that immigration potential varies considerably among guilds, that local species richness does not necessarily correspond to immigration limitations, and that some guilds (e.g. sedge-meadow perennials) will likely benefit more than others from being planted at restoration sites."	41	1	0	0	37	0	57	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is post-fire lichen abundance an effect of pre-fire population size?Location: Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Minnesota, USA.Methods: Lichen abundance, estimated as ground cover and dominated by Cladonia spp., was mapped in plots in two fields before prescribed burning on 06.10.2003 and 15.10.2003 for the first time since abandonment in the 1950s. The plots were resurveyed one year post-fire.Results: Post-fire cover of Cladonia spp. varied strongly between the fields, most likely due to different weather conditions between the burn events, which resulted in different fire intensities, one of low and one of high intensity. In the field that experienced the low intensity fire, post-fire cover of Cladonia spp. was still relatively high, and showed a positive relationship with pre-fire cover, while no such relationship was found after the high intensity fire. In that field Cladonia spp. experienced high mortality rates irrespective of pre-fire cover.Conclusions: This study provides an example of how species response to disturbance can be a function of population size, but that this relationship can be non-linear; lichens in grassland can survive a low intensity fire proportionally to pre-fire population size, but experience high mortality rates above a fire intensity threshold. The applications of these results are that fire intensity matters to species response to prescribed fire, and that the persistence of climax lichen communities and biodiversity in the study system needs a broad range of fire intervals."	20	0	0	0	19	0	26	2005-11-01	WOS:000235079600010	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

RGR varies between 0.13 and 0.21 d(-1). A significant correlation between mean hemerobiotic value, resulting from the phytosociological study, and measured RGR of juvenile plants emerges. Although Specific Leaf Area (SLA) is highly correlated with RGR, and thus explains most of its variations, as previously found in other studies, it is only weakly related to hemerobiotic state. An additional data set with 78 species from the literature supports the conclusions. This approach allows a functional quantification of hemeroby which enables useful applications, for instance in cartography. A biotope map showing a steep gradient of disturbance impact in the city of Rome is presented as a preliminary test."	21	0	0	0	16	0	21	2004-05-01	WOS:000221960200015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	YES

It has become a most successful alien woody plant in New Guinea, occurring from sea level up to 2000 in a.s.l. The species prefers initial stages of forest succession and is particularly common in recently abandoned gardens representative of a system of swidden agriculture. It often attains high cover, suppresses other pioneer species and becomes the absolute dominant species in these habitats. The species is now also spreading into naturally disturbed habitats far from direct human influence, such as natural tree-fall gaps, landslides and frequently flooded stream banks. It has, however, never been found in a closed primary forest. The species germinates from faeces of mammal and bird species, and we conclude that dispersal through endozoochory contributes to this species' extraordinary success in Papua New Guinea. A similar invasion behaviour has been documented over a large geographic area, from Malaysia to Fiji. Piper aduncum has attributes which are common amongst successful invasive species: (1) a large native geographic range; (2) aggressively colonizing disturbed habitats in its native area; (3) relatively small seeds; (4) a short juvenile period; (5) a large seed production every year."	30	0	0	0	22	2	37	2002-12-01	WOS:000181162900011	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

While studies have extensively investigated these factors individually, research on how invasive species impact the susceptibility of grasslands to encroachment is less common. Using the aspen parkland, an endangered savannah-type ecosystem, we asked how the presence of a widespread invasive grass in North America, smooth brome (Bromus inermis), impacted the growth and survival of one-year old trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings. We also asked if plant litter was a potential mechanism of inhibition (as has been proposed for brome litter) or coexistence (as has been hypothesized for aspen litter) in this system.LocationAlberta, Canada.MethodsWe used a manipulative experimental approach to determine if the survival and subsequent growth of planted aspen seedlings was impacted by the presence of smooth brome and manipulation of litter amount and type.ResultsWe found that the presence of smooth brome reduced aspen survival by 57% compared to uninvaded habitats, likely mediated by reduced soil moisture, while litter manipulation had no effect on survival. For surviving seedlings, local context had complex impacts on growth; the addition of aspen litter to brome-invaded communities increased seedling growth while aspen litter additions to native communities resulted in decreased growth.ConclusionThese results suggest that invasion by smooth brome will alter the dynamics of aspen establishment in this system, potentially leading to significant changes to this already endangered landscape. Though smooth brome may serve as a barrier to aspen establishment, accumulation of aspen litter from nearby stands to brome patches could lead to faster growth of seedlings in invaded areas at the edge of existing aspen stands. Our results also suggest more generally that the impact of invasive plants on the establishment of native woody plants can be dependent on litter inputs."	3	0	0	0	1	0	3	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800007	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location The northern temperate forests of the Lower St. Lawrence region (Quebec, Canada). Methods Changes in relative prevalence of tree taxa were reconstructed with early land survey records (1821-1900) and modern forest inventories (1980-2010). Forest composition reconstructions were then used to analyse changes in tree taxa assemblages at the landscape scale and test for potential landscape homogenization. Results Our results show important maple (Acer saccharum and A. rubrum) and poplar (Populus tremuloides and P. balsamifera) encroachment, shifting from the 6th to the 2nd position of relative prevalence and from the 7th to the 5th position, respectively, resulting in a significant shift in tree assemblage. Maple has spread throughout the whole landscape and tended to become the most abundant taxon in communities where they were already present in pre-settlement times. Poplar also widely spread throughout the landscape but rarely became the most abundant taxon. Accordingly, deciduous encroachment clearly engendered a spatial homogenization of composition at the landscape scale. Conclusion Considering that both red maple and trembling aspen are opportunist early-successional species, the increased relative prevalence of both species, as well as the consequent reorganization of tree taxon assemblages and landscape homogenization, probably resulted from the regional convergence toward an early-successional state. Along with the restoration of long-lived shade-tolerant conifer populations, land and forest managers should aim to increase the heterogeneity of forest stand composition to improve forests resilience to future global changes."	12	0	0	0	10	0	13	2019-09-14	WOS:000486543700001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We predicted that the species richness of exotic taxa (mostly terrestrial annual/biennial grasses and forbs in the study systems) would be reduced by flooding, while the richness of native riparian species adapted to fluvial disturbance would increase. We surveyed the riparian vegetation at three sites on each of two regulated rivers in the summers before and after a large flood in early spring that inundated all of the sites on one river, and one site on the other river; the remaining sites were not flooded. Overall, the study was a natural experiment with a before-after control-impact design.ResultsAs predicted, flooding dramatically reduced the richness of exotic taxa, particularly of terrestrial grasses. However, some invasive flood-tolerant exotic taxa, such as blackberries and willows, were promoted by the floods. Flooding reduced the cover of most native taxa, but did not affect overall native taxon richness. In contrast, the richness and cover of native summer annuals increased following the flood.ConclusionsOur study provides evidence to support the use of managed floods to reduce the prevalence of terrestrial exotic taxa within the riparian zones of regulated rivers.

We analysed the site conditions and phytosociological releves in old and new meadows. Small differences in site parameters between old and new meadows contrasted with a clear floristic differentiation between the two meadow types. The vegetation of old meadows was much more differentiated along prevailing environmental gradients than the vegetation of new meadows. Despite the favourable site conditions for the re-establishment of species-rich meadows on the former arable land, restoration success was limited to the vicinity of remnant stands. In contrast to old meadows, indicator species of new grassland were still typical species of regularly disturbed ruderal and arable habitats, often capable of building up a persistent seed bank.The precise mapping of 23 target species revealed that even wind dispersal predominantly leads to re-establishment in the close circumference of parent plants. We found no indication that regular flooding, hay-making and autumnal grazing had an impact on recolonization of newly created grassland.

Prefire vegetation condition is often unknown in rangelands but it likely affects variation in postfire invasion resistance across large burned scars. Whether satellite-derived products like the Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) can fulfill prefire information needs and be used to parametrize models of fire recovery to inform postfire management of IAGs is a key question.Methods: We used random forests to ask how IAG abundances in 669 field plots measured in the 2-3 years following megafires in sagebrush steppe rangelands of western USA responded to RAP estimates of annual:perennial prefire vegetation cover, the effects of elevation, heat load, postfire treatments, soil moisture-temperature regimes, and land-agency ratings of ecosystem resistance to invasion and resilience to disturbance.Results: Postfire IAG cover measured in the field was 22 over bar $$ \overline{22} $$% and RAP-estimated prefire annual herbaceous cover was 15.7 over bar $$ \overline{15.7} $$%. The random forest model had an R-2 of 0.36 and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 4.41. Elevation, postfire herbicide treatment, and prefire estimates from RAP for the ratio of annual:perennial and shrub cover were the most important predictors of postfire IAG cover. Threshold-like relationships between postfire IAG cover and the predictors indicate that maintaining annual:perennial cover below 0.4 and shrub cover below <10% prior to wildfire would decrease invasion, at low elevations below 1400 m above sea level.Conclusion: Despite known differences between RAP and field-based estimates of vegetation cover, RAP was still a useful predictor of variation in IAG abundances after fire. IAG management is oftentimes reactive, but our findings indicate impactful roles for more inclusively addressing the exotic annual community, and focusing on prefire maintenance of annual:perennial herbaceous and shrub cover at low elevations."	5	0	0	0	2	0	5	2024-01-01	WOS:001128243100001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We asked how slashing affects: (1) the seed production and seed bank of A. barbata, (2) the mortality of perennial native tussock grasses, and (3) plant community composition. Location: Near Burra, Mid North region of South Australia. Methods: We established two parallel experiments in an invaded grassland: one in a stand dominated by exotic and invasive species ( poor  condition), and the other in a less-degraded stand with an abundance of native perennial grasses ( good  condition). The experiments had a randomized block design (six blocks) with three treatments each: no slashing, slashing once a year or slashing every other year, applied over 3 years. We assessed the effects of the treatments on the number of seeds per m(2) and soil seed bank of A. barbata, number of death native tussock grasses, and floristic composition and diversity. Results: Slashing reduced seed production and the soil seed bank of A. barbata in both stands. Slashing increased the mortality of native grasses in the stand in good condition, and slightly changed floristic composition only in the stand in poor condition. Here, slashing decreased the abundance of the invasive species A. barbata and Bromus rigens but favoured other exotic species. No changes in species richness or diversity were detected. Conclusions: The slight response of the plant community to slashing suggests that these grasslands are resistant to changes in management. However, the reduction in seed production and soil seed bank of A. barbata suggest that longer term application of slashing could reduce its abundance and allow native species to recruit. The mortality of native tussocks can, however, negate the benefit of reducing abundance of invasive species."	2	0	0	0	2	0	2	2023-01-18	WOS:000902012700001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Desert shrubs are foundational species that can facilitate native plant communities but can also benefit exotic species. The influence of exotic plants on the establishment of benefactors from seeds or seedlings is a critical knowledge gap. We tested if the establishment, survival, or growth of seedlings for a benefactor shrub species in California was reduced by the invasive grasses that they facilitate in the field. Location San Joaquin Desert, California, USA. Methods We conducted a field survey to determine if a native shrub,Ephedra californica, facilitated the invasive grassBromus madritensis. Using seed collected from the field, we conducted a competition experiment onEphedra californica, using a densities series ofBromus madritensisand under manipulated conditions of light, water, and simulated herbivory. We measured seedling establishment, survival, and biomass ofEphedra californicaandBromus madritensis. Results In the field,Ephedra californicafacilitatedBromus madritensiswithin the shrub canopy. In the competition experiment,Bromus madritensishad consistent negative effects onEphedra californicaemergence and seedling survival at all resource and herbivory levels. The emergence and survival ofEphedra californicawas reduced in low light, but none of the manipulated conditions increased the competitive effect ofBromus madritensis. Conclusions Reciprocal costs of facilitation by shrubs were evident in emergence and seedling survival but not in growth once established. Water, herbivory, and shade did not mitigate these costs, but also did not exacerbate competition from exotics. Direct competition with exotic plant species is the most significant impact tested here on dryland shrub species and manipulations of resources or herbivory may not effectively promote shrub recruitment. Native shrubs are well adapted to variable desert conditions and could be effective foundational species if invasive grasses are reduced."	10	0	0	0	10	0	11	2020-08-19	WOS:000556425200001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Assessment of prescribed fire and cutting as means of controlling the invasion of sub-alpine grasslands by Echinospartum horridum	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	21	2	NA	NA	198	206	NA	10.1111/avsc.12354	Article	APR 2018	2018	"Aims: Sub-alpine grassland ecosystems have some of the highest biodiversity in Europe and constitute high-value natural resources. These grasslands are under threat because of the abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral activities and subsequent invasion by woody species. In the Central Pyrenees (Spain) several management techniques have been used to stop expansion of the highly encroaching shrub Echinospartum horridum. However, the ways in which these techniques affect recovery of sub-alpine grasslands are poorly understood. The final goal of this study is to gain information about the effects of E. horridum management practices and provide recommendations for the local stakeholders.Methods: This study evaluated the efficacy of controlled fires and mechanical removal of above-ground vegetation in controlling expansion of E. horridum into sub-alpine grasslands in the Central Pyrenees. E. horridum demography (germination and survival), soil seed bank and soil properties were recorded in two E. horridum stands where vegetation was previously removed by (1) fire (burning treatment) or (2) mechanical removal (cutting treatment) and (3) an undisturbed E. horridum stand (control).Results: The burning treatment increased germination and survival of E.horridum seedlings more than the cutting treatment, relative to the control. Therefore, cutting appeared to be a better option for controlling E. horridum. Soil seed density was higher in the management treatments than in the control, but it did not harbour sub-alpine grasslands species. E. horridum removal favoured recharge of the soil with seeds that arrived by dispersal. The soil seed bank in the burning treatment had higher seed abundance and seed diversity than in the cutting treatment; however, fire promoted a loss of soil nutrients.Conclusions: The soil seed bank composition (low abundance and diversity of native species) coupled with rapid regeneration rate of E. horridum would prevent recovery of the sub-alpine grassland based on the soil seed bank alone. Traditional shepherding has been reported to favour seed dispersal, and here we recommend E. horridum removal with cutting treatment as an additional practice for integrated management and recovery of the sub-alpine grasslands."	16	0	0	0	12	0	16	2018-05-08	WOS:000430912500004	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What were the most important factors determining the level of restoration success?Location: Noard-Fryslan Butendyks, northwest Netherlands.Methods: The frequencies of target plant species were recorded before de-embankment and monitored thereafter (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10 yr later) using permanent transects. Vegetation change was monitored using repeated mapping 14 yr before and 1, 7 and 10 yr after de-embankment. A large-scale factorial experiment with 72 sampling plots was set up to determine the effects of distance to a breach point, distance to a creek and grazing treatment on species composition. Abiotic data were also collected from the permanent transects and sampling plots on elevation, soil salinity and redox potential.Results: Ten years after de-embankment, permanent transect data showed that 78% to 96% of the target species were found at the restoration site. Vegetation mapping, however, showed that the diversity of salt marsh communities was low, with 50% of the site covered by the secondary pioneer marsh community. A multivariate analogue of ANOVA indicated that the most important experimental factor determining species composition was the interaction between distance to the nearest creek and livestock grazing. The combination of proximity to a creek and exclusion from livestock grazing always resulted in development of the high marsh community. In contrast, the combination of being located far from a creek, grazed and situated at low elevation with accompanying high salinity resulted in development of the secondary pioneer marsh community.Conclusions: Using target species as criteria, restoration success could be claimed 10 yr after de-embankment. However, the diversity of communities in the salt marsh was lower than desired. Variable grazing regimes should be applied to high-elevation areas to prevent dominance by single species of tall grasses and to promote formation of vegetation mosaics. Low-elevation areas need lower grazing pressure. Also, an adequate soil drainage network should be preserved or constructed in low-elevation areas before de-embankment."	17	3	0	0	16	0	22	2016-02-03	WOS:000368074600009	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Syntaxa were classified into five degrees of naturalness: urbanized, agricultural, semi-natural, sub-natural, and natural. Vegetation maps showing naturalness were derived in a vectorial GIS. The degrees of naturalness were ordered according to increasing naturalness. If c(i) is the cumulative relative value of every mapped area of the degrees of naturalness, the sum of these cumulative values A = Sigma c(i) is is a measure of vegetation artificiality. Its maximum value is A(max) = n-1. The Index of Vegetation Naturalness IVN = 1-A /A(max), ranging from 0 to 1. Our IVN is an extension of the ILC by Pizzolotto & Brandmayr (1996) due to the ordinal character of the vegetation classification into degrees of naturalness. The maps of vegetation naturalness were also analysed by two known metrics for the evaluation of landscape quality: TECI (Total Edge Contrast Index) and MSI (Mean Shape Index).Results: The case studies show that IVN is linearly correlated with decreasing area of urbanized and agricultural vegetation types as well as with increasing area of the highest degree of naturalness.Conclusions: IVN can be joined with the TECI for the evaluation of naturalness of landscapes. TECI can supply additional information about the importance of landscape ecotones. Our case studies suggest that an urbanized landscape should correspond to IVN values lower than 0.20.

Increasing grazing intensities suppressed the peak negative associations. More intense grazing enhanced the tendency towards independent distribution of these two species.Conclusions: The small-scale spatial associations between A. frigida and T. acaulis were significantly different at four different intensities of sheep grazing.

We additionally assessed the influence of indaziflam on the recruitment of perennial grasses and forbs from the seedbank, and root and shoot biomass of young perennial grass plants.LocationDry Mixed Grassland of Alberta, Canada.MethodsPlant biomass and cover composition were monitored over 4 years after indaziflam application in fall and spring at concentrations of 0, 37.5, 75, and 150 g ai ha-1 across two field sites, with four replication blocks for each concentration. Seedling emergence was assessed in the greenhouse using soil cores from fall plots two seasons after treatment. Root and shoot biomass of greenhouse-cultivated perennial grasses treated with indaziflam at 2 months age were quantified 2 months later.ResultsIndaziflam did not affect the cover, richness, or diversity of non-brome plant species until the fourth year after treatment. In the fourth year, indaziflam reduced plant richness and diversity and affected the cover of the three most abundant grasses but not the cover of the three most abundant forbs. Total shoot biomass decreased in the second year, increased in the third, and stabilized by the fourth year following indaziflam treatment. Perennial grass biomass either increased or remained the same but did not decline under any indaziflam treatment in any year. Forb biomass was not affected. In the greenhouse, indaziflam-treated soil had reduced seedling emergence of forbs but not perennial grasses, and indaziflam applied at 2 months of age reduced root and shoot biomass of four-month-old perennial grasses.ConclusionsOur study provides an improved understanding of how indaziflam affects nontarget plant community composition and biomass within northern mixed grasslands where native vegetation is relatively intact but under increasing risk of invasion by annual bromegrasses. Land managers considering indaziflam application will have to weigh small reductions in diversity and subtle changes in perennial grass composition against the beneficial control of annual brome."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-03-23	WOS:001445692900001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Evaluating the feasibility of using plant-specific metabarcoding to assess forest types from soil eDNA	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	27	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12806	10.1111/avsc.12806	Article	OCT 2024	2024	"Questions: An essential aspect of variation in natural systems is that species respond to complex environmental gradients. Recognizing plant composition gradients associated with abiotic factors (ecoclines) can be foundational for defining habitat types, which, in turn, helps map natural variation. Typically, ecoclinal structures are assessed through visual evaluation of above-ground vegetation and analysis of covarying abiotic factors. However, the correlation between ecological structures detected by soil eDNA plant assessments and those identified by visual assessment remains largely unexplored. Location: Hvaler archipelago, southern Norway. Methods: Plant diversity assessments were conducted using metabarcoding of the trnL (UUA) intron p6 loop and ITS2 from 31 soil samples collected across six forest types. These forest types span gradients related to drought risk and calcium richness. Results: The barcode amplicons identified 70 plant taxa, primarily vascular plants (67), with most assigned to the species level (59), representing common forest taxa across the sites. Comparisons between soil eDNA compositions and theoretical forest-type compositions showed a low to medium correspondence (26% to 76%) between the two. Ordinations of soil eDNA compositions revealed two axes without clear ecological interpretation and correlated poorly with the calcium-richness gradient previously identified by visual assessments. Conclusions: Overall, our results emphasize the necessity for comprehensive sequence reference libraries to conduct thorough plant biodiversity assessments. They also highlight the potential of soil eDNA to assess plant composition, which can aid in ecosystem mapping."	2	0	0	0	2	0	3	2024-10-15	WOS:001329748600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	YES

Clipping and seed addition promote native grass recovery, but these effects could depend on the phenological overlap between invaders and native species. We evaluated the importance of the interaction between two types of clipping, species phenology and sowing to restore temperate grasslands invaded by the cool-season forage species Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue).Location: Flooding Pampa grassland (Buenos Aires, Argentina).Methods: We applied selective and non-selective clipping on tall fescue during the peak growing season, combined with the sowing of native cool-and warm-season grasses. Plant species cover was estimated visually for 3 years; species were cat-egorized by functional groups. Moreover, through emergence trials, we evaluated whether the soil seed bank had been impoverished by invasion.Results: Regardless of selectivity, clipping decreased tall fescue cover by 12%/year, which reduced microsite limitation. Consequently, total native richness increased by 5 spp./year and cover increased from 3% to 50% by the last experimental year, inde-pendent of clipping type. Moreover, native warm-season grasses, the group with the least phenological overlap with invaders, increased by nearly 25% in cover and by 5 spp./m(2) with clipping and independently of sowing. Contrarily, native cool-season grasses, with more phenological overlap with invaders, increased 5% with propagule addition. Furthermore, the seed bank was enriched with tall fescue and depleted of cool-season grasses.Conclusions: Our results reveal that overcoming microsite limitation is a necessary condition to restore plant diversity in grassland invaded by tall fescue. Nevertheless, seed limitation and phenological overlap may be particularly important to restore the diversity of some native functional groups of plants. Considering the phenology of species can help to identify either clipping targets or phenological groups to be sown when restoring native diversity."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2023-08-21	WOS:001044692500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We combined different ecological restoration techniques to evaluate potential to control the invasive grass Urochloa decumbens and restore plant species composition. Specific questions were: (a) are herbicide application and topsoil removal efficient to control U. decumbens cover and allow native species establishment; and (b) are hay transfer and sowing native grass species efficient to reintroduce native species and increase their cover? Location Campos grasslands, southern Brazil. Methods We combined the follow restoration techniques: (a) herbicide application or topsoil removal to control the invasive species, and (b) hay transfer or sowing of native grasses to reintroduce native species. We assessed and compared native plant species richness, vegetation cover, native species cover, U. decumbens cover and other exotic species cover in 2016 and 2017. Results Herbicide application reduced invasive species cover more than topsoil removal, even though both were effective. The decrease of U. decumbens cover led to an increase in native species cover and native species richness. Hay transfer and sowing native grasses did not produce satisfactory results for native species reintroduction. Native species richness and U. decumbens cover increased from 2016 to 2017. Conclusion Herbicide application was a better option to control U. decumbens and to allow recovery of native species. However, use of herbicides in restoration is controversial, and more detailed studies on impacts are necessary. Environmental filters appear to be a major cause for failure of hay transfer and seeding species. Recovery of the native plant community is a great challenge in invaded subtropical grasslands, and additional management actions and time are necessary to increase the establishment of native species."	19	0	0	0	18	5	20	2019-01-01	WOS:000459825800010	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We aimed to develop and apply allometric models for above-ground, below-ground and total biomass of paramo plants.LocationThe paramo of southern Colombia between 1 degrees 09N and 077 degrees 50W, at 3,400 and 3,700m a.s.l.MethodsWe established 61 1-m(2) plots at random locations, excluding disturbed, inaccessible and peat bog areas. We measured heights and basal diameters of all vascular plants in these plots and classified them into seven growth forms. Near each plot, we sampled the biomass from plants of abundant genera, after having measured their height and basal diameter. Hence, we measured the biomass of 476 plants (allometric set). For each growth form we applied power-law functions to develop allometric models of biomass against basal diameter, height, height x basal diameter and heightxbasal area. The best models were selected using AIC(c) weights. Using the observed and predicted plant biomass of the allometric set we calculated absolute percentage errors using cross-validation. The biomass of a plot was estimated by summing the predicted biomass of all plants in a plot. Confidence limits around these sums were calculated by bootstrapping.ResultsFor groups of <20 plants the biomass predictions yielded large (>15%) errors. Applying groups that resembled the 1-m(2) plots in density and composition, the errors for above-ground and total biomass estimates were <15%. Across all plots, we obtained an above-ground, below-ground and total plot biomass of 329190, 743 +/- 486 and 1011 +/- 627g/m(2) (mean +/- SD), respectively. These values were within the range of biomass estimates obtained destructively in the tropical Andes.ConclusionsIn new applications, if target vegetation samples are similar regarding growth forms and genera to our allometric set, their biomass might be predicted applying our equations, provided they contain at least 50-100 plants. In other situations, we would recommend gathering additional biomass measurements from local plants to evaluate new regression equations."	11	2	0	0	7	0	13	2018-07-01	WOS:000442660900012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	YES

Following the limiting similarity hypothesis, we address the question of whether or not similarity of plant functional traits helps developing seed mixtures of native communities with high resistance to invasive species at an early stage of restoration.LocationCentre of Greenhouses and Laboratories Durnast, Technische Universitat Munchen, Freising, Germany.MethodsUsing a system of linear equations, we designed native communities maximizing the similarity between the native and two invasive species according to ten functional traits. We used native grassland plants, two invasive alien species that are often problematic in disturbed areas (i.e., Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Solidago gigantea) and trait information obtained from databases. The two communities were then tested for resistance against establishment of the two invaders separately in a greenhouse experiment. We measured height of the invasive species and above-ground biomass, along with leaf area index, 4 and 8months after sowing respectively.ResultsBoth invasive species were successfully reduced by the native community designed to suppress S. gigantea dominated by small-seeded species. These results could be considered as partial support for the limiting similarity hypothesis. However, given the success of this mixture against both invasive species, suppression was better explained by a seed density effect resulting from the smaller seed mass of the native species included in this mixture. Further, the dominance of a fast-developing competitive species could also contribute to its success.ConclusionsThere was no unequivocal support for the limiting similarity hypothesis in terms of the traits selected. Instead we found that increasing seeding density of native species and selecting species with a fast vegetative development is an effective way to suppress invasive plants during early stages of restoration. If limiting similarity is used to design communities for restoration, early life-history traits should be taken into account."	33	0	0	0	32	0	36	2018-12-28	WOS:000442660900006	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What is the potential of the soil seed bank for the conservation and restoration of native riparian plant diversity? Are non-native dominant grass species affected by agriculture and do they affect species richness?LocationSouth Nation River watershed (an agricultural watershed), Ontario, Canada.MethodsWe examined the riparian above-ground vegetation at 24 sites located across a large (similar to 4000km(2)) North American watershed and identified the corresponding soil seed bank composition from soil cores using the seedling emergence method. The above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank species compositions were compared in terms of species richness, percentage of non-native species and a floristic quality index. Factors affecting these descriptors of plants communities (concentration of in-stream nitrate and percentages of surrounding natural habitat and annual crop land) were assessed. The effects of agriculture on two dominant non-native grasses species and their effects on species richness were also assessed.ResultsIn total, 274 plant taxa were identified, including 181 taxa in the soil seed bank and 231 taxa in the vegetation. Overall species richness was high in both the soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation and was unaffected by measures of agricultural intensity (surrounding annual crop land and N enrichment). Above-ground vegetation species richness was strongly negatively affected by the widespread and dominant non-native grasses, Phalaris arundinacea and Bromus inermis, whereas soil seed bank species richness was unaffected. The community compositions of both the soil seed bank and vegetation were negatively affected by the loss of natural habitat and by N enrichment. In fact, an increase in the percentage of non-native species and a decrease in floristic quality were observed along a gradient of agricultural intensity.ConclusionsSpecies richness of the soil seed bank demonstrated resilience to invasions by P.arundinacea and B. inermis, and the soil seed bank showed good potential for conservation of taxonomic diversity.

Spatial autocorrelation at each site was measured along 50-m transects among three different landscape positions representing different moisture levels. Dissimogram multivariate analysis was used to measure the nugget, dissimilarity and patch diameter. Additionally, richness and Shannon diversity indices and nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis were compared to the dissimogram results.ResultsMean patch diameter was significantly higher in grazed mid-slope sites than in ungrazed sites. Spatial autocorrelation was not different between the landscape positions (higher, dry areas were not different from lower, mesic areas). However, plant species richness, diversity and community composition were found to be different between landscape positions and management, with key differences in the presence of certain invasive species.ConclusionsDisturbance and moisture level were reflected differently in the spatial autocorrelation analysis compared to the richness, diversity and ordination analyses. This indicates that disturbance and management impacted spatial autocorrelation separate from plant community composition and species diversity.

Here, we evaluated whether increased anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition would have an effect on species composition and ecosystem invasibility by B.tectorum at high elevations, and whether B.tectorum cover was associated with decreased native plant diversity.Location: Sagebrush steppe of the eastern Sierra Nevada, CA, US, at the western edge of the Great Basin Desert.Methods: We set up 54 paired plots, half of which were exposed to elevated N deposition (50kg center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1) at the time of snowmelt for 4yr) and half acted as controls, in areas differing in disturbance history (grazed, burned and grazed-burned). We monitored species composition each summer from 2008 to 2011 and then compared species richness, Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's dominance (D'), Simpson's evenness (E-1/D), B.tectorum dominance and community similarity (with ANOSIM and SIMPER analyses) by N treatment and disturbance history.Results: Species composition differed by disturbance history in all years (ANOSIM, P<0.05), and the grazed-burned plots consistently had the highest levels of B.tectorum dominance (P0.0003) and cover (P0.0001). Bromus tectorum cover was inversely related to native forb species richness (r=-0.44, P<0.0001), H'(r(s)=-0.73, P<0.0001), -ln(D') (r(s)=-0.75, P<0.0001) and E-1/D'(r(s)=-0.49, P<0.0001). We found no evidence that increased N deposition would affect native plant diversity after 4yr in this arid montane ecosystem, but the possibility of longer-term effects cannot be eliminated.Conclusions: Results suggest that high-elevation plant communities are already experiencing invasion impacts even though changes to the fire cycle have not yet occurred. In the most disturbed areas, B.tectorum cover is approaching the threshold for increased fire risk, which could result in more severe impacts at high elevations."	17	4	0	0	14	0	27	2013-11-01	WOS:000324090800006	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Nevertheless, selecting seed mixes and seed quantities are hard tasks in restoration projects. An interesting idea is to design seed mixes using functional traits and create a community based on limiting similarity to overlap and outcompete the invader. We aimed to test the effect of two sown communities (one created to overlap the invader niche) and three seed sowing densities to reduce the performance of the invasive grass Eragrostis plana. Location: Greenhouse experiment in the Campos Sulinos grasslands region, Southern Brazil. Methods: We created a bifactorial experiment. The first factor was the sown community, each composed of nine native grasses but with different proportions: (1) Limiting, based on limiting similarity, and (2) Balanced, where all species were sown at the same seed weight. We used leaf functional traits (Specific leaf area, leaf area, leaf dry matter content ) to design the Limiting community. The second factor was the seed density of native species, sowing twice (1) 1 g/m(2), (2) 2 g/m(2), and (3) 4 g/m(2) (i.e., total density was 2, 4, and 8 g/m(2)). E. plana was sown once at 0.5 g/m(2). Above-ground and below-ground biomass of all species were collected after nine months to assess the treatment effects. Results: Biomass production of the invasive species was lower when sown with native species. Nevertheless, both sown communities did not differently affect the invasive biomass production. Higher seed density of native species resulted in lower invasive above-ground biomass, but not below-ground biomass. Three native species did not germinate, consequently, the established communities were quite different from those designed. Conclusions: The low species germination limited our discussion about the use of limiting similarity to design seed mixes. High seed sowing density is a better approach when defining sowing strategies to compete with invasive grasses."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2024-09-08	WOS:001304044900001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, there is a progressive reduction of active saltworks, causing changes in the adjacent halophytic communities and, ultimately, the invasion by opportunistic plant species. Assessing the impact of land use change is key to understanding and protecting these fragile wetland ecosystems. Here, we explore how the abandonment of saltworks is impacting plant communities. We assess if the reduction in saltworks activity alters the composition of protected halophytic communities and favours the invasion by Carpobrotus edulis, an invasive species in many coastal regions throughout the world. Location The Natural Park of Ria Formosa (Algarve, Portugal). Methods We studied variations in the structure of halophytic communities affected to different degrees by C. edulis over three saltworks land use regimes in the Ria Formosa. Plant cover and soil salinity were estimated in a total of 60 transects pertaining to two saltworks complexes harbouring different land use and hydrologic regimes. We performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of saltworks based on plant cover and identified the indicator species of each saltworks class. Results We found that plant communities significantly varied among types of saltworks according to the pattern of soil salinity and hydrologic regime. We identified C. edulis as the main indicator species of the abandoned saltworks' communities, characterized by less saline soils and being desiccated in summer. Conclusions Land-use change caused by the abandonment of salinas facilitated the transition of halophytic into psammophytic communities and the invasiveness of C. edulis.

Revegetating these edges may reduce some of their negative effects, such as their permeability to biological invasions and detrimental effects on wildlife, potentially becoming suitable habitat for a broad range of species. Selecting species with low post-dispersal seed predation rates may improve the effectiveness of revegetation programmes.LocationMediterranean scrublands in SW Spain.MethodsWe made offerings of a total of 16,000 seeds of eight species of fleshy-fruit shrubs both along SLD edges and scrubland interiors in two independent blocks in each of three distant locations. Using four types of selective enclosure, we assessed the relative contribution of three seed predator guilds (ants, rodents and birds) to seed predation rates both along SLD edges and scrubland interiors.ResultsThe effects of anthropogenic edges on seed predation rates were species-specific. The large and hard-seeded species Chamaerops humilis was not predated at all. Juniperus phoenicea and Corema album seeds had higher predation rates in scrubland interiors than in edges. The small-seeded Rubus ulmifolius experienced relatively low seed predation rates compared to the other species. Predation rates for this species were higher along SLD edges than in scrubland interiors. Ants were the main seed predators in the area, and showed marked preferences for J.macrocarpa and C.album seeds at both SLD edges and scrubland interiors.ConclusionsOur results show the strong context-dependency of seed predation rates in both SLD edges and scrubland interiors, and thus the importance of well spatially and temporally replicated studies. Species with large and hard seeds may be good candidates for roadside revegetation programmes. However, the relative suitability of plant species would depend on the seed predator community. Our findings confirm that studies on seed predation may help planning cost-effective species selection for edge revegetation efforts worldwide."	5	0	0	0	5	0	7	2018-01-01	WOS:000425120600007	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We compared the demographic characteristics of native central-European and invasive USA-populations of Lythrum salicaria growing in similar habitats. Based on the Evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis, we predicted that shoot density, height, and biomass, fertility, and fecundity would be less in the European populations due to greater loss of plant material caused by exposure to control agents. Shoot density was significantly greater in most USA-populations, but shoot height and biomass were similar in invasive and native populations growing in similar habitats, especially in growing seasons with greater water availability. The number of fertile shoots was greater for invasive populations, except for those growing in sandy, nutrient-poor substrates, while percent fertility did not differ between populations growing under similar field conditions. Fecundity was also similar for populations growing in nutrient-poor and intermediate habitats, but was significantly greater in USA-populations (89103 seeds per fruit), compared to European populations (5864 seeds per fruit), growing in nutrient-rich habitats; seed predators were found in these European populations only. Log-linear analysis of transition frequency matrices showed that the growth of USA-populations is different from European populations, but that habitat effect was strong. Population dynamics were similar for populations growing in nutrient-poor habitats; location was of marginal importance only. USA-populations responded differently from European populations growing in intermediate and nutrient-rich habitats; differences were most pronounced between invasive (center of its North American distribution) and native populations growing in nutrient-rich habitats. The use of insect herbivores as biological control agents in North America will work best against L. salicaria populations growing in nutrient-rich habitats in the center of its invasive distribution, but will be less effective against populations growing in other habitats or portions of its range. Other factors, including nutrient- or water availability, and climate, may be as important as herbivory in affecting invasive populations; these factors interact to control L. salicaria in a more complex manner than thought previously."	26	0	0	0	21	0	30	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900013	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

At these same sites, we quantified levels of turbidity and 15 chemical compounds that affect water quality.ResultsThere was significant spatial heterogeneity of the seed communities sampled along both rivers, with particularly distinct communities collected downstream from the open pit mine. We also found a significant effect of the dam on seed composition and abundance in the Rancher & iacute;a River. Seed assemblages, but not seed numbers, differed between seasons and rivers. We also found significantly higher levels of chemical compounds and turbidity downstream of the mine compared to upstream.ConclusionsThere is a significant effect of the dam and the open pit mine on the Rancher & iacute;a River in Colombia. The alteration of natural flows, environmental conditions, and water quality affects hydrochory, a key ecological function of the river. Urgent measures are imperative to address these challenges effectively and ensure the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-06-01	WOS:001497262200001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, seed rain studies in Southern Hemisphere grasslands remain scarce, and little is known about the effects of grazing on seed rain. We evaluated the seed rain in grasslands with distinct grazing intensities (high, moderate, low, very low, and not grazed) in subtropical southern Brazil.LocationLong-term cattle grazing management experiment in subtropical Campos grassland, southern Brazil.MethodsSeed rain was collected, using pot traps with sterile soil, monthly for one year. Additionally, we recorded species in the fruiting phase present in the vegetation. The seed rain was estimated by the seedling emergence method. We performed randomization tests to compare seed rain density and composition among managements and seasons, and evaluated functional composition of the seed rain (broad functional groups of plants and dispersal traits).ResultsWe observed high numbers (up to 106,070 seedlings/m2, representing the maximum annual sum) in seed rain samples, with seeds from 90 species. The ungrazed treatment showed the highest number of seedlings. Across seasons, no significant differences were found, due to large variation. Similarity between seed rain and vegetation was low (S & oslash;rensen index values between 13% and 30%).ConclusionOur results indicate that large numbers of seeds are dispersed and potentially incorporated into the soil seed bank at the grassland site.

"Fire has contrasting effects on the survival, growth, and reproduction of Cerrado grasses with differing regenerative strategies"	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	27	2	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12775	10.1111/avsc.12775	Article	APR 2024	2024	"Background: Cerrado grasses are closely linked to fire, but the mechanisms underlying their responses are poorly understood. Fire affects populations by altering vital rates, and different regenerative strategies likely influence responses as resprouting ability trades off with seeding investment. Specialist grasses mostly occupy old-growth habitats and rely almost entirely on vegetative regeneration, suggesting potentially higher fire tolerance than habitat generalists that can colonize anthropized and degraded habitats due to high seeding investment. Thus, we explored the effect of fire on one specialist (Trachypogon spicatus) and two generalist (Aristida riparia and Schizachyrium microstachyum) tussock grasses. Location: Frequently burned grassland in Central Brazil. Methods: We monitored the vital rates of 150 individuals/species in burned (prescribed late-dry-season fire) and unburned plots. Survival, resprouting, and reproduction were assessed monthly for six months post-fire and then again 16 months after fire. Tussocks were measured for size (area of the base) and vegetative height for changes in structure. We collected seed mass, seed fill, and germination rates from the literature. Results: Fire negatively affected the generalist grasses, increasing mortality (+12%), decreasing size (50%), and inhibiting flowering and inflorescence production. The specialist benefited from burns, showing high survival (97%), recovery of pre-fire structure, and stimulated reproduction. Generalist species had a high investment in seeds (seed fill > 60%; germination > 50%), while the specialist produced empty seeds (88%) with low germination (3%). Size was not related to the probability of survival but significantly increased the reproductive output. Conclusions: Results suggest that the specialist Trachypogon spicatus could persist under very frequent fires (e.g., annual), given its robust fire tolerance and post-fire recovery. Where this species is a restoration priority, it would likely benefit from techniques that promote vegetative regeneration rather than direct seeding. Contrarily, generalist grasses are less resilient to fires and require longer fire intervals to allow population persistence."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2024-04-13	WOS:001198476900001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Does herbivory suppression increase native while reducing alien species diversity?Location: Central-eastern Tierra del Fuego Island, Argentina.Methods: In four sites, we set up three different treatments: excluded grazing by livestock (cattle), by livestock and native (guanaco) herbivores, and grazed control plots in Nothofagus antarctica forests. We then monitored the dynamics of understorey native and alien plants (species richness, abundance) of dicots, monocots, and ferns over 6 years. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to determine the effects of herbivore exclusion and time on species richness and abundance. In addition, we calculated the abundance rate of change to quantify temporal dynamics.Results: Overall species richness did not change in the exclusion plots, but native and alien abundances were affected by herbivory and time since exclusion. The abundance of native monocots changed after herbivore exclusion, increasing its dominance significantly inside exclusion plots. However, the cessation of herbivory did not reduce alien species in general. Only alien dicots significantly declined in the livestock exclusion treatment. Further, we found that the two dominant alien grass species (Holcus lanatus and Poa pratensis) respond differently to grazing exclusion, and their response was modulated by forest basal area.Conclusions: Our results indicate that cattle and guanaco grazing had variable effects on native and alien plants, and that herbivore exclusion has a substantially positive effect on native grasses. However, the magnitude of temporal changes was more significant for vegetation richness and abundance than the effect of exclusion treatments. Herbivore exclusions can initiate a rapid recovery of compositional attributes of native vegetation in N. antarctica forests grazed by livestock."	4	0	0	0	2	0	4	2023-09-25	WOS:000969126500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

While their effects on digestibility or litter decomposition had been studied separately, few, if any, studies have tested the responses simultaneously and the underlying relationships with community functional structure. We tested whether the mass ratio hypothesis or the niche complementarity hypothesis held in scaling up from species to community level. Location Dry calcareous rangelands of southern France on a limestone plateau. Methods We measured digestibility and litter decomposability of 24 communities in three management regimes representing an intensification gradient corresponding to a combination of increased fertility and grazing. Key structural leaf traits (e.g. leaf dry-matter content, LDMC) and chemical traits (e.g. leaf nitrogen content, LNC, and leaf neutral detergent fiber, LNDF) were measured as well as communities' mean (i.e. community-weighted mean, CWM) and variance (i.e. community-weighted variance, CWV). Results Digestibility and litter decomposability were higher in intensively grazed and fertilized than in lightly grazed and abandoned communities. Increased nutrient availability combined with more intense grazing induced an increase in CWM LNC and a decrease in CWM LDMC and CWM LNDF. Communities in these regimes were less functionally diverse, with lower CWV LDMC and lower CWV LNDF. Conclusions The close relationship between digestibility and decomposability was maintained at the community level. Relationships between CWM, community digestibility and decomposability were more consistent across the management regimes than relationships with CWV, supporting the dominance rather than the complementarity hypothesis."	5	0	0	0	4	0	5	2022-10-31	WOS:000870745100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Yet few studies have measured the effect of restoration efforts on ecosystem functioning or the functional diversity (FD) that underpins it. Here we assessed change in FD of restored assemblages one to 25 years after the onset of post-mine restoration.Location: Northern Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) Forest bioregion of southwestern Australia.Methods: Functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion were derived from five plant functional traits relevant to community reassembly. Effects of three explanatory variables (i.e. age, year restoration was initiated, and time since fire) on six response variables (i.e. four FD indices, species richness, and compositional similarity to nearby reference forest) were analysed using linear mixed models for a data set with repeated measures of plots through time (n = 810 plots), and linear models for a subset of one-time measures of different aged assemblages (i.e. space-for-time approach; n = 490 plots).Results: Functional evenness and functional dispersion increased with age, while functional divergence and functional richness decreased with age. Functional dispersion increased with time since fire, while functional richness decreased with time since fire. Species richness decreased with age, but at 25 years, species richness was comparable to that observed in reference forest. In contrast, similarity showed no relationship with age of restored forest, and at 25 years, similarity of restored forest to reference was low compared with similarity of reference forest to itself. Three of four FD indices had not reached those of reference jarrah forest 25 years after restoration had been initiated.Conclusions: Reassembly of FD suggests importance of environmental filtering and high functional redundancy. A longer time frame may be needed to assess FD of restored assemblages, and in the meantime, species richness is not an adequate surrogate of FD."	8	1	0	0	6	0	10	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900013	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What is the relative importance of environmental filtering and spatial processes on structuring liana beta diversity at taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic levels? Is there any synergy between these drivers (environmental factors and spatial distance) on shaping these three dimensions of beta diversity in a savanna liana community? Location A dry-hot valley savanna in Yunnan Province, southwest China. Methods We established 30 20 m x 20 m plots in the savanna to collect data on the distribution of 22 liana species, 19 functional traits, and plot-level soil nutrients, elevation, and slope. The relative contributions of these environmental factors and spatial distance to liana taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dissimilarity were analyzed using multiple regression on distance matrices. We also tested which environmental factors influence the beta diversity of liana community using permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Results Both environmental and spatial distances were significantly correlated with taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dissimilarity. Spatial distance explained more variation in taxonomic beta diversity than environmental factors. But for both nearest-neighbour functional and phylogenetic distanceD(nn'), environment explained relatively more variation than space did. Moreover, the proportion explained by environmental variables was ranked in decreasing order as follows: functionalD(nn'), phylogeneticD(nn'), and taxonomic beta diversity. We found soil pH had the highest contribution to taxonomic and functional beta diversity, while soil total nitrogen contributed most to phylogenetic beta diversity. Conclusions This study revealed that liana taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic beta diversity in the studied hot-dry savanna ecosystem is affected and maintained by both environmental filtering and spatial processes. Moreover, the functional and phylogenetic diversities were more strongly subject to environmental filtering. Our study provides information on the mechanisms underlying liana diversity maintenance in savanna, which is necessary to inform conservation management in this vulnerable ecosystem."	10	3	0	0	11	0	13	2020-09-17	WOS:000566696300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Seed banks are a critical component of site resilience as their persistence can be crucial for recovering from disturbances. We predicted that site condition and landscape structural elements (perennial plant patches) would strongly influence the richness and density of the soil seed bank. Location New South Wales, Australia. Methods We conducted a seedling emergence study to investigate the germinable seed bank in semi-arid woodland. Soil samples were collected from three woodland communities (Cypress pine, Black box, Red gum) from sites in three levels of site condition (poor, average, good) and from four patch types (tree, shrub, grass, open). Seed bank species were assigned to three plant trait groups based on: (a) origin; (b) lifespan; and (c) palatability. We used linear models to assess the effects of community, site condition and patch type on the richness and seed density of the germinable seed bank. Results Site condition did not affect the seed bank density or richness, except for a lower density of highly palatable species at poor-condition sites. Across all communities the importance of patch type on the soil seed bank density and richness varied with plant traits. The seed bank of perennial plant patches had a greater density of perennial species, a lower density of low palatability plants, and a greater richness of native and perennial species than interspaces. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the germinable soil seed bank in semi-arid woodlands can be relatively resilient to degradation. This suggests that disturbed sites where perennial patches remain, may still have the ability to recover, because these patches act as important seed reservoirs."	12	2	0	0	8	0	15	2020-07-01	WOS:000543807700006	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We aimed to study the effect of native woody encroachment on grassland plant biodiversity in loess steppe fragments by analysing the vegetation composition of grasslands subjected to increasing levels of encroachment. We studied both ancient and restored grasslands with the following research hypotheses: (a) increasing woody encroachment decreases total diversity and the species richness of dry-grassland species; and (b) the effect of woody cover on grassland biodiversity differs between ancient and restored grasslands. Location South-Eastern part of Transdanubia, Hungary, Central Europe. Methods Altogether 63 loess grassland fragments were selected for the study. The percentage cover of trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation were recorded in 400-m(2)-sized plots (n = 110). The effects of woody encroachment and grassland age on diversity, total species richness of the herb layer, and richness of dry-grassland species were analysed. Results We found that woody encroachment affected the total richness of the herb layer and the species richness of dry-grassland species. For most of the listed variables, lowest values were found for the highest woody encroachment groups. Grassland age affected the species richness of the herb layer and that of dry-grassland species; lower values were detected in restored grasslands. In restored grasslands, Shannon diversity and species evenness were lower, while Berger-Parker dominance was higher than in ancient grasslands. Species composition and richness displayed a relatively high resistance to moderate woody encroachment; the highest decrease in diversity was detected at a high level of woody encroachment (>52% of woody cover). Conclusions We can conclude that low to moderate woody encroachment cannot be simplistically regarded as degradation. Results suggest that moderately encroached loess grasslands can be easily restored by the suppression of woody species, as their species pool still contains many dry-grassland species targeted for restoration."	22	1	0	0	20	0	26	2020-01-21	WOS:000508638700001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Research on vegetation responses to the land application of biosolids has increased in the past 20 years, but there is no consensus on how plant communities respond to biosolids applications. What factors influence productivity and vegetative cover following biosolids application for grassland reclamation? How does the addition of biosolids impact plant community responses? Location: Global, but predominantly North America and Europe. Methods: To explore vegetative responses following biosolids application, we used a global systematic review and meta-analysis of 59 articles. Our meta-analysis used the log response ratio (LRR) as an effect size for productivity, total cover, species richness, diversity and exotic species abundance and explored covariates addressing various site characteristics and reclamation strategies. Results: We found that across sites, the land application of biosolids significantly increased productivity and cover but had no significant overall effect on species richness, Shannon diversity or exotic species abundance on degraded lands. These increases in the LRR for productivity and vegetative cover were lower on sites that experienced a fire prior to biosolids application. Climatic variables like mean annual temperature were shown to alter the response of vegetative cover, where warmer sites tended to have more positive responses to biosolids. Seeding was found to increase plant cover but decrease species richness early in the reclamation process. Conclusions: This area of research is growing; most of the publications we used come from the last 20 years and were mostly conducted in North America and Europe. While we can build on the present literature, there is clearly room for more research to ensure the process of reclaiming degraded ecosystems using biosolids results in desired plant communities, e.g. high native species diversity.

Measurements of soil pH may be used, however there are not sufficient measurements available to map soil pH nationwide on site level. Instead we developed a soil pH map based on vegetation data. Location Natural terrestrial areas in The Netherlands. Methods 271,693 vegetation plots were used to estimate average soil pH per plot with indicator values, based on field measurements, of plant species. By spatial interpolation average pH values between the plots, with the soil type, groundwater table and vegetation management type as ancillary explanatory variables we created a soil pH map. The map covers all terrestrial nature areas (all areas that are not built up areas, agricultural areas and infrastructural areas) in the Netherlands with a map resolution of 25 x 25 m(2) raster cells. Results The predicted pH of the map varied between 3.0 and 8.6 with standard errors between 0.13 and 0.93. Most of the standard errors range from 0.4 to 0.55, with an average just below 0.5 pH unit. Cross-validation shows that for 33% the difference between observed and predicted is between -0.1 and 0.1 pH-unit and for 83% the difference is between -0.5 and 0.5 pH-unit. Validation shows that the pH map is unbiased (mean error is almost zero), accurate (root mean squared error is 0.64) and nicely captures spatial patterns (r = 0.77). We applied the pH map to assess the impact of acidification on the abiotic quality of nature areas in the Netherlands. Conclusions The model fit in the predicted soil pH is in good resulting in a low standard error and a high correlation.

Location Central Tasmania, Australia. Methods We use nutrient status to test recovery trajectories of soils within eucalypt woodland restorations established on ex-pasture sites. Eucalyptus trees within these sites have been successfully established but understorey plant communities have had negligible recovery. Soils from restoration sites, aged from 3 to 22 years, were contrasted with those from two reference ecotypes: established pastures and native eucalypt woodlands presumed to be similar to that originally replaced by the pastures. We hypothesized that (a) total soil carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N) would be substantially higher in forest soils than in pasture soils; (b) soil nutrient levels would be lower in forest sites than within pasture sites; and (c) if restoration soils were recovering they should fit between these continuums according to age of planting. Results Woodland and pasture reference soils were highly constrained in soil C:N and conformed to expectations. However, ex-pasture restoration sites retained the characteristically low C:N and high nutrient levels of pasture soils, in particular total N. They also failed to demonstrate a transformational effect with age of planting. Conclusions The results suggest that both restoration interventions and natural processes had not sufficiently disrupted existing below-ground systems within the given time frame. Such an intractable stable state within the soil system highlights the need within restoration practice for an increased emphasis on soil ecological transformation. Improving and implementing practices aimed at driving soil change may assist a timelier reassembly of complex native ecosystems. This study also shows that soil C:N ratios may provide a cheap and simple means of identifying soil constraints on restoration."	9	0	0	0	9	0	9	2019-03-11	WOS:000459825800011	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, it is not well known how increasing precipitation and atmospheric N deposition interact with the land use legacy to affect nutrient availability, plant species composition and therefore vegetation dynamics of the Mongolian Steppe.Location: Steppe in Xilin River Basin, Inner Mongolia, China. The mean annual precipitation is 343 mm with 60%-80% of it occurring during the plant growing season.Methods: We conducted a 6-years (2005-2010) field experiment to manipulate N and water availability on sites experiencing two different historical stocking rates. Species composition, above-ground biomass and plant N concentration were determined at both individual and community levels. Soil cumulative inorganic N and N mineralization rates were determined by laboratory incubation.Results: (1) Supplementary irrigation increased soil cumulative inorganic N and N mineralization rate, plant community N uptake, and the abundance of perennial species for the site with high historical stocking rate. In contrast, long-term water addition decreased soil cumulative inorganic N and N mineralization rate, and did not change the plant community N uptake, but increased the abundance of Cleistogenes squarrosa as a species indicative of degradation for sites with moderate historic stocking rate. (2) Nitrogen addition increased soil cumulative inorganic N and N mineralization rate irrespective of grazing history under ambient precipitation, and resulted in a burst of annuals in moist years at both sites. Under supplementary irrigation, N addition increased soil cumulative inorganic N and N mineralization rate at the site with moderate historic stocking rate, but not at the site with high historical stocking rate, and increased the abundance of taller perennial species at both sites.Conclusions: Legacy effects of grazing greatly affect plant composition responses to increasing water and N availability. The effectiveness of N application in restoring heavily degraded sites in the Mongolian steppe depends on precipitation availability. In the face of increasing precipitation and atmospheric N deposition, resource managers should be prepared to cope with the different vegetation succession and recovery trajectories as a result of historical land-use difference."	13	5	0	0	11	0	18	2018-05-08	WOS:000430912500007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Recently, however, meadows that have either been abandoned or maintained only by annual burning or annual mowing have increased. We compared plant species richness, vegetation height and soil pH and water content between traditional meadows and those abandoned or maintained only by burning or mowing. We also examined relationships between these variables and the species richness of plant life-form groups.ResultsThe mean total and rare plant richness (36 and eightspeciesm(-2), respectively) in traditionally managed meadows were higher than in meadows of other management types (<26 and 5speciesm(-2), respectively). Vegetation height (20-290cm) and soil pH (4.2-6.2) varied among study plots. Burning and mowing frequencies negatively influenced vegetation height and positively influenced soil pH and/or water content. Traditional management practice provided intermediate vegetation heights (90cm) and soil pH (5.3). Total species richness showed a unimodal relationship with vegetation height (peaking at 125cm), and rare species richness was highest at intermediate levels of vegetation height (86cm) and soil pH (5.2).ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that intermediate levels of vegetation height and soil pH have been maintained through traditional practices combining both infrequent burning and mowing.

We also assess microsite location and species-specific differences among the nurse shrubs in order to provide management guidance.Location: Dehesas of holmoak (Quercus ilex) in central Spain.Methods: We examined oak regeneration in four different microsites (tree canopy, shrub cover, open and tree-shrub) and across three distinctive and representative management types for a period of, at least, 30 yr: (1) traditional management (i.e. extensive sheep rearing); (2) high commercially competitive management (extensive cattle); and (3) wildlife management (wild ungulate grazing, mostly deer).Results: Wildlife management showed higher abundance and diversity of shrubs. Predicted seedling density under wildlife management was three-fold higher than sheep, and almost nine-fold higher than under cattle management. Highest oak density was found under shrubs that grew beneath trees, twice as high than under trees, ten-fold higher than under shrubs outside the tree canopy, and almost 40-fold higher than in open microsites. However, the proportional facilitative effect of shrubs was higher in open areas than under trees. Three shrub species (Erica australis, Genista hirsuta and Rosmarinus officinalis) showed significantly higher probability of facilitating oak seedlings in comparison to other shrub species, indicating species-specific differences in plant facilitation. Most young oak trees (saplings and juveniles) exceeded the average shrub height, suggesting that facilitation occurs mostly at the seedling stage.Conclusions: Only dehesas under reasonable wildlife management showed a clear three-layered structure with a significant representation of the shrub layer, which increased seedling density. Current cattle management was the least sustainable in terms of oak regeneration. Even though shrub cover, in general, facilitated oak seedlings, not all species were equivalent facilitators. Only three low-palatable and large-sized shrub species were keystone facilitators that should be especially considered in restoration and management practices. Further agriculture policies should promote reduction of cattle densities, rotational grazing and mixed species management to enhance the regeneration of these systems."	31	0	0	0	26	0	37	2016-06-01	WOS:000374545600009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Changes in species composition were evaluated using the Sorensen dissimilarity index, in species frequency with Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests, and in species cover using one-sample t-tests. Tree encroachment was evaluated using aerial photographs and satellite imagery. We used linear discriminant analyses (LDA) and ANOVA to evaluate the impact of tree encroachment on species composition.Results: We found a floristic dissimilarity of 35% between 1984 and 1985 and 2012. Most species whose frequency and mean cover increased were peatland species, while most species with lower frequency and mean cover in 2012 were non-peatland species. The total area occupied by forest increased from 26% to 51%, an overall gain of 280 ha of forest. The species composition of old and new forests as well as of open sectors was highly distinct, as shown by the LDA that correctly assigned 97% of the sampling plots to these groups. Non-peatland species were 15 and five timesmore abundant than peatland species in old and new forests than open habitats, respectively.Conclusions: Gradual drying of the peatland margins due to drainage of the surrounding catchment, as well as post-fire succession are likely the main drivers of the changes observed. Overall, our study showed that peatlands isolated in an anthropogenic landscape are dynamic ecosystems where vegetation communities can experience substantial changes in a short time frame. The broader implication is that peatland conservation in highly modified landscapes must be linked to restoration."	28	0	0	0	23	0	33	2015-04-01	WOS:000352131500007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do different life forms respond to environmental filtering and dispersal limitation in the same way?Location: Seventeen mountains (31 degrees 8-44 degrees 22N, to 104 degrees 42-128 degrees 8E) in China.Methods: We measured the plant species composition of 495 plots. We calculated the Jaccard's similarity (S-Jac) of species composition, geographic distance (D-g) and environmental divergence (D-e) for each plot pair for trees, shrubs and herbs. Three plot pair groups were distinguished: (1) plot pairs with both plots from the same mountain; (2) plot pairs with two plots from different mountains but with a similar environment; (3) plot pairs with two plots from different mountains and with a heterogeneous environment. We analysed the relationship between S-Jac, D-g and D-e for all three groups, and performed partial redundancy analysis. We also calculated beta-diversity of mountains, and explored latitudinal and climatic patterns of beta-diversity.Results: S-Jac decreases significantly with both D-e and D-g for all three plot pair groups. Environmental and geographic variables together explain 13.8%, 11.6% and 11.1% of variance in species composition of trees, shrubs and herbs, respectively. For all life forms, environment explains more variance than geography, and environment and geography have strong co-varying effects. The beta-diversity for each mountain decreases with latitude, but increases with mean annual temperature (MAT).Conclusion: Environmental filtering rather than dispersal limitation predominantly regulates patterns of species turnover in the temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests of China. Furthermore, the increases of beta-diversity along MAT also support the effects of environment on species turnover. These results indicate that environment might influence the distribution of most species in temperate forests of China. However, dispersal limitation still independently accounts for a small amount of variance in species turnover. We therefore conclude that environmental filtering and dispersal limitation have both combined and independent effects, but environmental filtering is more important in shaping the community assembly of temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests of China."	27	9	0	0	29	0	40	2015-01-01	WOS:000345761800005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer regime affect jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining in Western Australia	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	16	4	NA	NA	610	618	NA	10.1111/avsc.12046	Article	OCT 2013	2013	"Question: Removal of vegetation and disturbance of the soil profile during mining reduce nutrient pools available for plants during mine site restoration. Thus, fertilizer is needed to replace the loss of nutrients available to support vegetation establishment. Yet the application of fertilizer can promote the establishment of competitively dominant species to the exclusion of others, particularly in low-fertility ecosystems. Here, we test effects of fertilizer application rates on the establishment of jarrah forest.Location: Five restored mine pits in the jarrah forest that grows on low-fertility soils in southwest Western Australia.Methods: Nitrogen (0 and 20kg elemental N center dot ha(-1)) and phosphorus (0, 10, 20 and 40kg elemental P center dot ha(-1)) were applied factorially to 20mx20m field plots at five sites restored after bauxite mining with seeds and seedlings of jarrah forest species.Results: Two and a half years after the experiment was established, there were no effects of N application rates on species richness, percentage vegetation cover or community composition of the restored jarrah forest. In contrast, P application had a number of effects on the restored jarrah forest. Species richness was highest at intermediate P application rates (10-20kg center dot ha(-1)) and lowest at the two extreme treatments (0 and 40kg center dot ha(-1)). Higher rates of P application resulted in a higher seedling density (2.5 vs 5.0m(-2) for 0 and 40kg P center dot ha(-1), respectively) and increased plant cover. Fertilizer P also significantly affected community composition, favouring ephemerals and weeds at high application rates and re-sprouting species at lower application rates. Community composition was more similar to the restoration target (unmined jarrah forest) at 0kg center dot P center dot ha(-1) (similarity value of 36%) than at higher P application rates.Conclusions: The data suggest that, in terms of maximizing species richness and percentage cover, a P application rate of between 10kg center dot P center dot ha(-1)and 20kg center dot P center dot ha(-1)is optimal for jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining. Additionally, the data suggest no benefit of N application at a rate of 20kg center dot N center dot ha(-1)."	29	2	0	0	27	1	31	2013-11-01	WOS:000324090800007	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Refuse dumps from leaf-cutting ants are a natural source of organic matter; however, their effects on native plant performance have received limited attention to date. Do refuse dumps from leaf-cutting ants (Acromyrmex lobicornis) enhance the germination and growth of several native plant species and what is the potential influence of heavy grazing on this practice? Location Monte Desert, Neuquen Province, Argentina. Methods We collected fruits of five plant species and two types of substrate (ant refuse dump vs control soil) from two known paddocks with different livestock densities (high vs low). We sowed seeds, previously weighed, of each species in both substrates from both paddocks and monitored their development. We harvested emerged seedlings, documenting their age and measured their height, weight, number of leaves, root weight and root length. Results Seed weight was lower in the highly grazed paddock for all the plant species studied. However, seed weight did not affect germination rate. Refuse dumps from the less grazed paddock (i.e. with higher nutrient content) enhanced the vigour of seedlings from smaller seeds more often than those from the highly grazed paddock. Also, germination improved when both seeds and substrate were from the less grazed paddock. Vigour variables showed more complex results, but seedlings growing in refuse dumps tended to be more vigorous. Refuse dumps from the less grazed paddock (i.e. with higher nutrient content) enhanced the vigour of seedlings from the highly grazed paddock (smaller) more than the seeds from the less grazed paddock (larger). Conclusions Our results demonstrated that ant refuse dumps increased plant germination rate and improved performance of the most representative vegetation in the Monte Desert. Given that external refuse dumps from leaf-cutting ants are a renewable resource, very abundant and easy to collect, this substrate could be used as a free natural fertilizer in arid regions to restore and manage vegetation cover, especially in heavily grazed sites."	9	1	0	0	10	3	14	2012-10-03	WOS:000308373500004	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To what extent is the taxonomic diversity reflected in compositional diversity of oak woodland vegetation? What are the main compositional gradients, their environmental correlates and associated gradients in species traits? How are the oak woodland types in Turkey distributed? What is their stand structure, ecological range, conservation value and how are they used? Which phytosociological syntaxa are represented? What gaps remain in knowledge of Turkey's oak woodlands that require further study? Location Turkey (SE Europe, SW Asia). Methods We used 1181 vegetation records of oak woodland retrieved from phytosociological literature, sampled at more than 100 sites all over Turkey. We classified the data set using a modified TWINSPAN algorithm and displayed the classification using a dendrogram and a synoptic table. We used detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis to identify main compositional patterns, their environmental correlates and associated gradients in species traits. The phi coefficient was used to identify the diagnostic species of the distinguished vegetation types. Species composition, ecological range, biogeographic affinities, traditional phytosociological treatment and land use of each type were described using standard forms. Results The main gradients in compositional diversity of Turkey's oak woodland vegetation range from xerophytic evergreen woodlands near the Mediterranean Sea coast to mesophytic deciduous forests near the Black Sea coast and to continental open (semi-) deciduous (south-) east Anatolian woodlands and shrublands. These compositional gradients are associated with gradients in species traits and macroclimate. Silvopastoralism and coppicing are very common forms of land use of Turkish oak forests, although both have somewhat declined recently. Old-growth forests are scarce or absent in most oak-dominated systems. Conclusions Compositional diversity of Turkish oak woodland vegetation is extensive and reflects the biogeographical subdivision of the country. However, the ecology of several oak species and their ecosystems is still little known. A major gap in the available data and knowledge lies in east and southeast Anatolia. The currently protected forest area should be revised to cover all the oak woodland types identified in this paper."	33	0	0	0	29	0	36	2012-10-03	WOS:000308373500014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Which is the proper degree of grass sward disturbance to enhance germination and establishment of plant material species? Does the establishment success depend on soil nutrient status of the restoration sites?Location: Northern Upper Rhine valley, southwest Germany.Methods: Seed-containing plant material was transferred to species-poor meadows. We tested two methods of sward disturbance: rotovation or ploughing before the transfer of plant material vs. a control, i.e. no disturbance but transfer of plant material. We studied vegetation development on nine sites for 3 yr.Results: Three years after the transfer of plant material, 101 species were successfully re-established on the restoration sites, including 28 Red List species. In contrast to our expectations, establishment was similar on rotovated and ploughed plots, both harbouring higher numbers and abundances of plant material species than the control plots. In contrast, the cover of resident grassland species differed significantly between ploughed plots (lowest cover), rotovated plots (intermediate cover) and control plots (highest cover) in the last 2 yr of vegetation recording. While elevated phosphorus was in line with reduced establishment of plant material species, potassium and total nitrogen had no negative effect.Conclusions: The transfer of plant material is an appropriate method to enhance plant biodiversity in species-poor grasslands. We show that a sward disturbance by rotovation or ploughing is crucial for species to re-establish. Our results suggest that ploughing is the more promising disturbance measure because it more persistently suppresses grassland vegetation."	49	1	0	0	42	1	51	2012-03-28	WOS:000301047300013	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is fertilizer application adequately reflected by the Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs)?Location: Eifel Mountains, West Germany.Methods: The Rengen Grassland Experiment (RGE) was established in an oligotrophic grassland in 1941. Six fertilizer treatments (Ca, CaN, CaNP, CaNP- KCl, CaNP-K2SO4, and unfertilized control) were applied annually in five complete randomized blocks. Species composition of experimental plots was sampled in 2006 and compared with constancy tables representing grassland types in a phytosociological monograph of a wider area. Each plot was matched to the most similar community type using the Associa method. Mean EIVs were calculated for each treatment.Results: The control plots supported oligotrophic Nardus grassland of the Polygalo-Nardetum association (Violion caninae alliance). Vegetation in the Ca and CaN treatments mostly resembled montane meadow of Geranio-Trisetetum (Polygono-Trisetion). Transitional types between Poo-Trisetetum and Arrhenatheretum ( both from the Arrhenatherion alliance) developed in the CaNP treatment. In the CaNP- KCl and CaNP-K2SO4 treatments, vegetation corresponded to the mesotrophic Arrhenatheretum meadow. Major discontinuity in species composition was found between control, Ca, and CaN treatments, and all treatments with P application. EIVs for both nutrients and soil reaction were considerably higher in P treatments than in Ca and CaN treatments. Surprisingly, the control plots had the lowest EIVs for continentality and moisture, although these factors had not been manipulated in the experiment.Conclusions: Long-term fertilizer application can create different plant communities belonging to different phytosociological alliances and classes, even within a distance of a few meters. Due to their correlated nature, EIVs can erroneously indicate changes in factors that actually did not change, but co-varied with factors that did change. In P-limited ecosystems, EIVs for nutrients may indicate availability of P rather than N."	85	1	0	0	69	0	91	2009-04-09	WOS:000267484100004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

In order to compare results under a variety of climatic conditions, this whole experimental setting was repeated four times (trials), with a four-year follow-up for each trial.Conclusions: The establishment rate of the moss carpet varied among years, in response to climatic variations between growing seasons. The relative success of different moss species and combinations of species, however, did not vary within or between trials. Thus, the species and combinations of species resulting in the highest short-term or long-term establishment rates remained the same for all trials, independent of the climatic conditions at the time of re-introduction. Our results showed no link between the number of species in the diaspore mixture and successful establishment of the moss carpet.

The effect of type, timing and frequency of disturbance on grass and forb species richness was examined using data from a long-term (> 50 yr) grassland burning and mowing experiment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.Grass species richness declined considerably (> 50%) in the absence of disturbance, whereas forb species richness was unaffected. Annual burning in sites not mown in summer tended to increase grass species richness relative to triennial burning (22% increase) with the reverse being true in sites mown twice in summer (37% decline). Forb species richness declined by 25% in sites mown twice in summer relative to sites mown in early summer only. Disturbance was necessary to achieve maximum grass species richness presumably by removing litter and increasing the availability of light. The interaction of time of mowing in summer (early versus late) and time of burning during the dormant period (spring versus winter) had the most dramatic effect on species richness. Time of burning had no effect on richness in sites mown in early summer, but winter burning resulted in a dramatic decline (27-42%) in richness in sites mown in late summer.

Features of a permanent plot study of post-agricultural succession in central New Jersey, USA, illustrate important implications of vegetation dynamics for restoration. In the past, such implications had to be drawn from chronosequences and coarse resolution studies, neither of which exposes the local contingencies relevant to site specific restoration, However, the fine scale and continuous nature of the current study reveal that succession is highly contingent on historical and local spatial heterogeneity. For example, the absence of one generally expected dominant stage, the demise of shrubs without replacement by later successional tree species, and the long and multimodal persistence of individual species suggest that neither the relay floristic or initial floristic models of succession is adequate to guide restoration. At the local scale volleys of species appear through the succession, and reflect spatial contingencies such as neighboring vegetation and edge relationships, and patchy behavior of different functional groups. The role of introduced species and of plant consumers are additional sources of local contingency. These local and time-specific behaviors in the vegetation are the patterns that restorationists must understand either to choose appropriate reference states, to prevent unexpected local dynamics, or to design interventions that are appropriate to the specific site of interests."	72	2	0	0	65	0	86	2001-06-01	WOS:000174290900006	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Climate change presents additional challenges to these communities, especially through the introduction and expansion of novel stressors. Understory plants in these communities provide important wildlife habitat, along with social and cultural value. Restoration management in northeast pitch pine (Pinus rigida) barrens has mainly utilized prescribed fire and mechanical treatments, including mowing and thinning. This study compared the effect of these regionally common management activities on the composition, diversity, and abundance of understory plant species.LocationPitch pine barrens in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York, United States.MethodsWe employed systematic grid sampling, using plots to measure species diversity and estimate abundance, along with other relevant environmental conditions, in the summers of 2022 and 2023. We sampled at 47 sites across three ecoregions. We used nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling to examine gradients in understory plant community composition across treatment types within ecoregions.ResultsDistinct understory community assemblages and structures were associated with different restoration strategies. This included a higher abundance of species that can endure fire and resprout from buried plant parts in prescribed fire units, whereas fire-sensitive species and those slow to recolonize after fire events were most abundant in untreated control units. Within prescribed fire treatments, the abundance of some fire-adapted species reflected relationships with fire severity, including Vaccinium angustifolium being associated with mowing followed by fire and Gaylusaccia baccata with areas experiencing fall burns. Restoration treatments also generated unique understory structural conditions related to treatment severity and frequency, including greater shrub densities important for several threatened wildlife species.ConclusionsImpacts to understory plant community composition and structure demonstrate the importance of reinstating disturbance events, particularly fire, within pitch pine barrens to restore desired conditions and support cultural and ecological objectives."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-08-17	WOS:001546251400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Here we asked: how does the intersection of two types of linear habitats (roads and rivers) affect plant species diversity, composition and ecological attributes?LocationSouthern France.MethodsWe studied road-river intersections (bridges) to test how composition, alpha and beta diversity, and ecological preferences of species in both roadside and riverside plant communities responded to the influence of bridges. We also used spatial predictors (spatial eigenvector maps) to assess whether bridges influenced directional spatial processes (upstream-downstream river axis) structuring community composition.ResultsWe showed that vegetation around bridges differed from that away from bridges in terms of species composition and ecological preferences, and reduced alpha and beta diversities. We also found a convergence of species' ecological preferences in plant communities of rivers and roads at bridges. The turnover component of species beta diversity was lower at bridges, presumably due to different disturbance regimes, leading to biotic homogenization. However, our results show that the impact of bridges on directional spatial processes affecting species composition was negligible.ConclusionThe strong effect of bridges as selecting forces of plant communities for both rivers and roads suggests bridges should not be overlooked.

Facilitation by pioneer trees and herbivore exclusion allow regeneration of woody species in the semiarid ecosystem of central Chile	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	26	3	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12741	10.1111/avsc.12741	Article	JUL 2023	2023	"Questions: Facilitation by pioneer plants and herbivore exclusion may contribute to plant regeneration and restoration of degraded semiarid ecosystems. In this study we evaluated the main and interactive effects of the exclusion of large and medium-sized mammal herbivores and the presence of the pioneer tree Vachellia caven on natural regeneration of woody species in degraded savannas.Location: Two localities of the native sclerophyllous forest of central ChileMethods: Twelve 30 x 40 m exclosures and twelve non-exclosure areas located near native forests were established in savannas of V. caven in each locality. Regeneration coming from seeds and resprouts was sampled both under the canopy of V. caven and without canopy in each exclosure and non-excluded area.Results: After seven years, species richness and density of older regeneration (0.5-2 m high) were positively affected by herbivore exclusion and the presence of V. caven. No significant interaction between herbivore exclusion and V. caven was observed. Younger regeneration (<0.5 m high) was positively affected by herbivore exclusion and the presence of V. caven only in some years with almost no interactive effect.Conclusions: The exclusion of large and medium-sized exotic herbivores and facilitation by pioneer trees are complementary for regeneration. The variable but permanent presence of younger and older regeneration within exclosures and under V. caven during the experiment may lead to an increase of density and diversity of adult plants and recovery of the native forest. However, this process may be slow due to other limiting factors, for instance, reduced precipitation associated with climate change."	4	0	0	0	2	0	4	2023-08-23	WOS:001041421500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	26	2	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12727	10.1111/avsc.12727	Article	APR 2023	2023	"Aims: By analysing cattle-and sheep-grazed sand grasslands, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) livestock type has a stronger effect on the vegetation characteristics than grazing intensity; (ii) sheep grazing results in lower biomass and species and functional diversity than cattle grazing, regardless of intensity; and (iii) increased grazing intensity causes a shift of the trait composition in grasslands.Location: Sand grasslands in the Nyirseg region, East Hungary.Methods: We selected 26 sand grassland sites grazed by cattle or sheep and classified them into four intensity levels. Vegetation composition was surveyed in 2 m x 2 m plots. We harvested the above-ground biomass from 20 cm x 20 cm plots; then dried and sorted it to live biomass, litter, moss, and lichen. We compared Rao dissimilarity index, species richness, Shannon diversity, evenness, and the community-weighted means of nine vegetative and generative traits along a grazing intensity gradient. We calculated functional richness, evenness, and divergence for comparison.Results: We found that some diversity metrics and community-weighted means of most studied traits were significantly affected by grazing intensity. Several characteristics were also affected by the interaction of grazing intensity and livestock type, but none of the studied characteristics was affected by livestock type in itself. Increasing Rao dissimilarity index peaking at the fourth grazing intensity level was detected, but for other multitrait indices, no such changes were proven, except for functional divergence, which was the lowest at the first intensity level. Graminoid, forb, and litter biomass were significantly affected by intensity, but none of the biomass fractions was affected by livestock type.Conclusions: We suggest that for the management of sand grasslands, grazing intensity should be carefully adjusted, considering not only livestock units per hectare. For practical recommendations, well-defined, long-term experiments studying different livestock and habitat types along an intensity gradient would be essential."	6	0	0	0	4	0	6	2023-09-25	WOS:000989305400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Can (de)coupled diversity-environment relationships be used to manage native and exotic species separately to minimize unintended impacts on one another?Location The tropical city-state of Singapore, Southeast Asia.Methods In two types of novel, exotic-dominated secondary forests regenerating from land abandonment, we surveyed both native and exotic trees >= 5 cm diameter-at-breast height (DBH) in 97 plots and correlated taxonomic and functional diversities to soil fertility (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and landscape configuration gradients (distance to old-growth forests and patch area).Results Native and exotic tree species had unshared or decoupled responses to distance to old-growth forest and soil phosphorus. The taxonomic and functional diversities of native, but not exotic, species declined rapidly with increasing isolation from old-growth forests. Exotic, but not native, species richness increased with soil phosphorus levels. Neither native nor exotic diversities were associated with soil nitrogen, potassium, and patch area.Conclusions Native and exotic tree species could be managed separately without unintended impacts on one another because of their decoupled responses to distance from old-growth forest and soil phosphorus. The native-distance-to-old-growth relationship suggests that novel secondary forests adjacent to old-growth forests can accrue native species with minimal intervention, while enhancement plantings of old-growth native species should target more isolated patches. The exotic-phosphorus relationship suggests that restoring soils to historically-low phosphorus levels can help to reduce exotic diversity, without negative impacts on native diversity.

We addressed three main questions: (i) How is the distribution of species among the topographic areas? (ii) Which abiotic variable is driving this distribution? and (iii) What is the difference among the mountain forests and between mountain forests and the Caatinga vegetation? Location The Maranguape mountain forest were divided into three topographic categories: windward (600-800 m, WMA), leeward (600-800 m, LMA) and top (above 800 m, TMA). We also considered another six areas of mountain forests and four Caatinga areas in Ceara State. Methods We calculated different structural parameters and the floristic diversity of each category. A Principal Correspondence Analysis was performed to analyze the indirect ordination of forest sites by species abundance. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis was conducted to evaluate which variables were driving species distribution. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling distance and the average linkage method to investigate the similarity among mountain forests and Caatinga. Results A total of 1,536 individuals belonging to 144 tree species distributed in 44 families and 93 genera were recorded. Myrtaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae were the most species-rich families.Myrcia splendenshad the highest importance value followed byGuapira nitidaandMollinedia ovata. The leeward slope showed the highest richness and diversity index, whereas the windward showed the highest density and the top showed the highest basal area. The ordination indicated a greater similarity between TMA and WMA than LMA. Conclusion Our results suggest that temperature, precipitation and slope angle are the abiotic factors driving species distribution in Maranguape. Those mountains are heavily anthropized and continuously explored, therefore these outcomes will be useful for conservation and restoration purposes in the poorly known semiarid region of Northeast Brazil."	6	0	0	0	4	0	7	2020-10-12	WOS:000573709600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Resilience, an ecosystem's ability to absorb disturbance and return to its initial functioning, is critical for this. We assessed the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands following restoration management. Using a novel multi-indicator approach, we asked how different taxonomic and functional facets of biodiversity influence resilience mechanisms. We demonstrated this approach for a case study in subalpine grasslands, asking: how resilient are grasslands dominated by Patzkea paniculata and their agronomic services to changing mowing regimes?Location: Villar d'Arene, Hautes-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, France. Boundary area of Ecrins National Park.Methods: A manipulative experiment tested the reciprocal effects of mowing cessation and mowing resumption for 10 years. We analysed floristic composition data following four steps. First, we used the Community Structure Integrity Index (CSII; Jaunatre et al., ) to obtain qualitative and quantitative summaries of taxonomic responses. The second step focused on taxonomic biodiversity using species richness, Simpson and Pielou indices, and responsive species identified in the first step. Third, we analysed functional diversity responses using functional groups and community weighted mean (CWM) of vegetative plant traits. Finally, we quantified ecosystem services impacts by estimating fodder quantity and quality using trait-based models.Results: The mowing manipulation demonstrated the high resilience of P. paniculata grasslands and revealed reversibility of transitions between mown and unmown states. By reducing the abundance of P. paniculata, the resumption of mowing restored forage quality. Supported by a complementary case study on post-disturbance re-sowing in hay meadows, this study demonstrates the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands to management change and explores underlying belowground mechanisms of vegetative regeneration and belowground reserves.Conclusion: Our novel multi-indicator approach provides multifaceted mechanistic understanding necessary to anticipate impacts of socio-ecological changes and to maintain the multiple benefits of mountain grasslands. Addressing the different facets of biodiversity from abundance data that are systematically collected in impact or monitoring assessment, this approach provides a common framework, widely applicable to different types of restoration or management interventions, across regions and biota."	7	0	0	0	5	0	8	2018-10-01	WOS:000450061000008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Will these factors result in differing plant community trajectories?Location: Southern Arizona (USA).Methods: Within a pipeline disturbance, we randomly selected nine plots to be seeded with an 18 species mix and nine to be left unseeded. Adjacent to the disturbance, we selected nine undisturbed unseeded control plots for a total of 27 plots (30 m x 45 m each). Within each of the 27 plots, we established a grazed-trampled, grazed-untrampled and ungrazed-untrampled subplot. One year after pipeline reclamation, we analysed the impacts of seeding, grazing and trampling on native plant cover, undesirable plant cover, herbaceous biomass, species richness, soil movement and plant community trajectories in comparison to surrounding undisturbed sites.Result: Seeding disturbed sites with a diverse seed mix resulted in greater native plant cover, higher species richness and fewer undesirable species than were found in unseeded disturbed sites. Unseeded disturbed areas were similar to the undisturbed control areas in species richness and had comparable plant community trajectories. The combined impacts of grazing and trampling reduced native plant cover and herbaceous biomass and were associated with increased soil erosion in comparison to subplots protected from grazing and trampling.Conclusions: Natural vegetation recruitment can be a viable option in semi-arid reclamation projects when the soil seed bank is preserved and there are proximal seed sources. While seeding improved quantitative vegetation metrics, using a seed mix comprised of different species than the preexisting vegetation may set the reclaimed vegetation on a different plant community trajectory. The general prescription of protecting new reclamation sites from grazing and trampling is supported."	8	0	0	0	6	0	11	2018-05-08	WOS:000430912500008	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The data set covered 35 high-maintenance grasslands, which are cut ormulched up to 14 times a year, and 65 low-maintenance grasslands with one to two cuts per year or sheep grazing. We used ANCOVA and DCA to assess drivers of vegetation composition and species richness. The floristic potential and options to restore biodiversity were assessed taking into account maintenance intensity and key abiotic variables of the grasslands using thresholds derived from published literature and our own data.Results: High-maintenance urban grasslands harboured significantly lower plant species richness compared to low-maintenance grasslands. However, plant species richness of both grassland types turned out to be lower than that of comparable semi-natural agricultural grasslands. Floristic composition was primarily conditioned by maintenance intensity, but for plant species richness environmental factors such as soil pH, phosphorus availability and city were additionally important. Just eight of the 100 studied urban grasslands were found to be already valuable and species-rich, whereas the vast majority showed relatively low species richness but a high potential for species introduction.Conclusions: Apparently, most urban grasslands exhibited quite constrained plant species richness, suffering from high-maintenance intensity but probably also from dispersal and seed limitations. Nevertheless, as the majority of the studied grasslands showed favourable abiotic preconditions for higher plant species richness, restoration techniques using species introduction could be an easy and promising method to support grassland biodiversity in urban areas."	50	0	0	0	42	0	54	2017-03-30	WOS:000396473500004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

There are many large, long-term data sets worldwide that include various measures of woody plant abundance, such as crown cover, that are faster and easier to measure than true counts of individuals. Quantifying the number of individuals allows in-depth research into various topics including functional ecology, carbon accounting, conservation and metabolic theory. Here we test the accuracy of predicting the abundance of individual woody plants from cover and forest structure measures, and explore the implications of refined abundance measures for understanding the rarity of woody plant species across southeast Queensland.LocationSoutheast Queensland (SEQ), Australia.MethodsTo supplement an existing data set of 1251 sites with measured crown covers for woody plants in various strata, we sampled stem counts in an additional 30 sites, forming a calibration data set. We ensured that these 30 sites covered the environmental variation in the study area. Generalized additive mixed effects models were used to predict stem counts for all woody plants in the original data set from their crown cover and forest structure values and a site-level variable accounting for water balance. We used these refined abundance data to investigate relationships between local and regional abundance for different size classes.ResultsStem densities increased with crown cover in a non-linear fashion; slowing once crown cover reached ca. 5% for shrubs and ca. 50% for trees, depending on their maximum potential height. Using the predicted stem count data, we found that shrubs were more locally abundant than trees, but less regionally abundant. Larger trees (>20m maximum potential height) showed a negative relationship between local and regional abundance; there was no significant relationship between other size classes.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates how crown cover can be converted to stem counts using a calibration data set and flexible mixed-effects models. This enables further ecological analysis at a fraction of the investment required to re-survey. Analyses of abundances revealed that tree species are less locally abundant than smaller woody species, likely due to space filling constraints, but more regionally abundant."	3	0	0	0	3	0	3	2016-11-23	WOS:000386136600016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We used a combination of distance-based multivariate methods and a series of univariate tests to study the effects of trampling on a number of conservation-relevant aspects of taxonomic and functional plant community composition and diversity.ResultsThe different trampling intensities led to a significant variation in plant species composition that was driven by trait-mediated responses, mainly of traits related to dispersal and regeneration, but these patterns only occurred close to the trails (<1.5m). Except directly on the trails, species richness, the number of habitat specialists and threatened species, as well as Functional Richness were not or marginally affected by trampling. Multivariate dispersion within levels of trampling intensities and evenness, the latter measured for either species or traits, remained constant across the gradient of trampling intensity.ConclusionsEven after 20yr of exposure to different intensities of trampling, calcareous grassland vegetation showed only few and spatially limited compositional responses, while its nature conservation value was not affected. Therefore, marked hiking trails are a good compromise between meeting the needs for recreation and environmental education, and the conservation of threatened habitat specialists and should be preferred to alternatives such as undirected access that would result in spatially extensive changes in community structure."	13	0	0	0	10	0	16	2015-07-02	WOS:000356007400002	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How does functional diversity relate to environmental variables within stands?Location: Northern temperate deciduous forests of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA.Methods: Ground-layer species cover and light availability were measured at each of four old-growth, even-aged second-growth, and managed uneven-aged stands (n = 12 stands total). We used mixed-effect models and fourth-corner analysis to assess relationships among forest structure, species traits and the three components of functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, divergence) based on 32 leaf, reproductive and whole plant traits from 111 species.Results: We identified differences in leaf phenology and morphology, life form and dispersal among stand types at the community level. Ground-layer plant communities of even-aged and uneven-aged stands were at opposite ends of a spectrum of strategies aimed at tolerating stressful vs competitive environments, respectively. In even-aged stands, communities were characterized by species adapted to relatively dark and closed conditions (heavy-seeded tree saplings, spring ephemerals). In contrast, managed uneven-aged stands were characterized by species with potential for quick returns on investment of nutrients and dry mass in leaves (i.e. early summer species with high specific leaf area, low leaf dry matter content and high phosphorus concentration). Old-growth stands had fewer trait associations than managed stands, and were characterized by ferns and species with either ballistic or wind-assisted seed dispersal. Functional diversity metrics were related in complex ways to light, management and soil texture. Managed stands had higher functional richness and divergence than old-growth stands, which, instead, showed higher functional evenness.Conclusions: Even-aged and managed stands support ground-layer species with a distinct set of traits relative to those found in old-growth forests. Although there is broad interest in uneven-aged management as a means to restore the structures and functions of old-growth forests, uneven-aged management does not, at least initially, produce ground-layer plant communities more similar to old-growth forests than even-aged management."	33	0	0	0	29	0	41	2014-07-01	WOS:000337725300004	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Methods Vegetation releves along 164 transects lying perpendicular to the shoreline along the Tyrrhenian coast of Central Italy were used to identify the presence of dune habitats by means of TWINSPAN classification and detrended correspondence analysis. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to analyse relationship between habitats and disturbance factors. The resulting Burt's table was used to build an index (habitat-disturbance, HDi) for analysing this relationship. Based on HDi values, a correspondence analysis (CA) between presence/absence of habitats and disturbances was performed. The overall plant species diversity of dunes was measured with NHDUNE, a modified version of the Shannon index. Multi-way ANOVA procedure was used to investigate effect of single disturbance factors and their interactive effect on NHDUNE. Results Classification and ordination procedures identified four sequential habitats moving from the shoreline to inland: annual vegetation on drift lines characterized by Cakile maritima; embryonic shifting dunes dominated by Elymus farctus; shifting dunes with Ammophila arenaria subsp. australis; back dune grasslands characterized by Ononis variegata. CA showed that disturbance factors influence dune habitats differently. In particular, the Cakile community had a negative relationship with beach tourism and mechanical cleaning; the Elymus community had a positive relationship with beach tourism and mechanical cleaning and a negative relationship with erosion and bathing establishments; the Ammophila community had a negative relationship with mechanical cleaning and bathing establishments and a positive relationship with dune cross-trampling; and the Ononis community had a negative relationship with bathing establishment. According to multi-way ANOVA, single disturbance factors can have different effects on plant species diversity as measured by NHDUNE. However, the overall effect is negative, with erosion as a single factor and the combination of mechanical cleaning and bathing establishments significantly lowering the plant diversity of coastal dune systems. Conclusions The proposed method allows a fast and replicable evaluation of the effects of disturbance factors on the conservation status of Mediterranean coastal dunes, providing the information necessary for development of conservation strategies focusing on a single habitat or on the overall dune system."	34	0	0	0	33	0	39	2013-04-03	WOS:000315690500018	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Therefore, we use the additive georegression framework for spatial prediction of Ellenberg values with the R-library mboost, which is a feasible way to consider environmental effects, spatial autocorrelation, predictor interactions and non-stationarity simultaneously in our data. The framework is much more flexible than established statistical and machine-learning models in species distribution modelling. We estimated five different mboost models reflecting different model structures on 50 bootstrap samples in each case. Results Median R2 values calculated on independent test samples ranged from 0.28 to 0.45. Our results show a significant influence of interactions and non-stationarity in addition to environmental covariates. Unweighted mean indicator values can be modelled better than abundance-weighted values, and the consideration of bryophytes did not improve model performance. Partial response curves indicate meaningful dependencies between moisture indicator values and environmental covariates. However, mean indicator values <4.5 and >6.0 could not be modelled correctly, since they were poorly represented in our calibration sample. The final map represents high-resolution information of site hydrological conditions. Conclusions Indicator values offer an effect-oriented alternative to physically-based hydrological models to predict water-related site conditions, even at landscape scale. The presented approach is applicable to all kinds of Ellenberg indicator values. Therefore, it is a significant step towards a new generation of models of forest site types and potential natural vegetation."	15	0	0	0	11	0	16	2013-02-14	WOS:000312159400012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

And how is the susceptibility of the different sowing treatments to immigration events via seed rain? We compared differences in using a low-diversity seed mixture in comparison with a high-diversity seed mixture, both sown on nutrient-deficient raw soil. We assessed differences of speed and pathway of vegetation development of different variants as well as their susceptibility to immigration events via seed rain.Location: Central German Lignite Mining District.Methods: In December 2004, the trial was established in complete block design with four variants: sowing of a low-diversity seed mixture with three grass cultivars and sowing of a high-diversity seed mixture with 40 herbs and 11 grasses of local provenance, both with and without an additional mulch layer. Vegetation surveys were made between 2005 and 2010. Using generalized linear models (GLM), we tested for treatment effects on species diversity, above-ground biomass, total coverage of vegetation as well as number and coverage of target grassland species. In addition, we estimated Bray-Curtis distances between treatments using non-metric-multidimensional scaling.Results: Sowing of a high-diversity seed mixture clearly accelerated the vegetation development and led to a significantly higher biomass production in the 1st year. On both variants, the additional mulch layer facilitated the establishment of sown species and led to a higher coverage of the herb layer in the 1st year. After 6 yr, the influence of the mulch layer decreased for the benefit of the seed mixture. Despite species exchange between sites, sites sown with different seed mixtures were still dominated by different sets of species in the final year of our study. Whereas high-diversity mixtures sped up vegetation development in the direction of highly diverse semi-natural grasslands, low-diversity mixtures considerably delayed the successional progress.Conclusions: In grassland restoration in surface-mined land, high-diversity mixtures performed similar or even better than low-diversity mixtures of grass cultivars with respect to ecosystem services such as biomass production and ground cover (erosion control). An additional mulch layer considerably accelerated the vegetation development in the 1st years on both sowing variants. In contrast to sowing of low-diversity seed mixtures of grass cultivars, the use of high-diversity seed mixtures of local provenance contributes to the enhancement of local biodiversity. Although target grassland species were able to migrate into the low-diversity sites, this process is slow and only possible when appropriate seed sources are nearby."	62	1	0	0	48	1	70	2012-04-01	WOS:000301047300005	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Does grazing favour plants with arid affinity over those with less arid affinity? Does the grazing-induced transformation constitute a switch to the equivalent of a shrub-dominated biome?Location: Central South Africa.Methods: Using systematic scanning of SPOT 5 imagery and ground-truthing, a grazing treatment area was selected that met criteria of intensity of grazing, sampling requirements, and biogeographical position within a broad ecotonal zone. Differential vegetation responses to heavy grazing were tested for significant differences in plant traits, vegetation structure, and species diversity, richness and evenness. Gamma diversity was calculated for the whole study site, whereas, independent beta diversity was calculated across the treatments assuming the additive partitioning of diversity. In addition, the biogeographical association of grazing-induced species shifts was determined using a range of available databases.Results: Canopy cover and height of woody shrubs increased significantly with heavy grazing whereas that of graminoid plants declined. The resultant species turnover was modest, apparent extinctions of local species were minimal, species richness was maintained and species diversity was significantly enhanced. There was a significant increase in species evenness, through possible suppression of dominant species. Significant increases in species cover were those associated with mainly the Nama-Karoo biome indicating that species from more arid areas are more resistant to grazing as would be expected by the convergence model of aridity and grazing resistance.Conclusions: The significant increase in shrub cover in heavily grazed semi-arid grassland followed general global expectations. The study confirmed that the supposed former large shift of grassland to shrubby Nama-Karoo in the eastern upper Karoo can indeed be readily affected by heavy grazing. The negative connotations for biodiversity that have often been associated with intense grazing seem, in terms of the positive responses of plant species diversity in this study, to perhaps be exaggerated. The elevated species diversity with grazing of vegetation with a long evolutionary grazing history in a low resource area may require a reappraisal of the application of certain grazing hypotheses."	45	0	0	0	39	1	51	2012-02-01	WOS:000299207600003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Heights of at least 20 cm were associated with hummocks. Frequency distributions of surface height and principal component analyses (separately for Canada and Estonia) were conducted to follow the evolution of microtopography in revegetated sites and their similarity with those of natural peatlands. In Canada, regressions were also performed to estimate the time required for the microtopography in revegetated cutover peatlands to become similar to that found in natural bogs.Results: Only 10-30 yr were needed for microstructures comparable to those in natural bogs to develop on restored peatlands where Sphagnum diaspores have been reintroduced. However, this process may take more than a century in cutover peatlands left to revegetate spontaneously.Conclusions: In cutover peatlands with spontaneous revegetation, hummock-hollow formation starts on bare peat which lacks both plant propagules and viable seed banks, and the initiation of microstructures is probably more akin to the process that occurs naturally. Nonetheless, hummock-hollow microtopography resembling that found in natural bogs without pools appeared, in all of the examined cutover peatlands, over periods that are short in terms of peatland development time-scales. Active peatland restoration could effectively reduce the time required for initiation of microtopography by about 70 yr."	50	0	0	0	38	0	57	2011-04-01	WOS:000287863600002	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How do species respond to these environmental variables?LocationTen mesotrophic grassland sites of high conservation value in southern England.MethodsSpecies cover was assessed in between 10 and 25 randomly selected 1-m(2) quadrats at each site. At each quadrat degree of waterlogging (W), soil Olsen extractable phosphorus (P) and soil pH were measured. Variation partitioning was used to separate site and soil effects, and HOF (Huisman, Olff & Fresco) modelling was used to produce response curves for the major species on soil gradients, based on coenoclines derived from partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA).ResultsVariation partitioning identified Site as the most important environmental variable (34.6%). Only 18.7% was accounted for by the three soil variables together; W (degree of waterlogging), P and pH accounted for 11.1%, 5.7% and 4.3%, respectively in raw form with 2.4% shared. However, when Site and the other soil variables were removed the variation explained reduced to 2.3% for W, 1.1% for P and 1.0% for pH. The species responses to each of these soil environmental factors could be separated into four types on each gradient. Most species were abundant at low W, low soil P and intermediate pH.ConclusionsSite-based factors were more important than the three soil variables, which were assumed to be directly or indirectly associated with productivity. This implies that each site has unique properties that are more important than the soil variables. The three soil factors were, however, significant and the groups of the most common species, based on significant response curves, can be used as a first approximation of indicators of environmental conditions in British mesotrophic grasslands for conservation. However, W accounted for most variation, and the current reliance on soil available P and soil pH for assessing conservation/restoration potential should be viewed with caution."	21	0	0	0	19	0	24	2009-10-01	WOS:000269455100007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How does the hydrological system sustain base-rich fen mires and fen meadows?Location: Interdunal wetlands and heathland pools in The Netherlands, percolation mires in Germany, Poland, and Siberia, and calcareous spring fens in the High Tatra, Slovakia.Methods: This review presents an overview of the hydrological conditions of fen mires and fen meadows that are highly valued in nature conservation due to their high biodiversity and the occurrence of many Red List species. Fen types covered in this review include: (1) small hydrological systems in young calcareous dune areas, and (2) small hydrological systems in decalcified old cover sand areas in The Netherlands; (3) large hydrological systems in river valleys in Central-Europe and western-Siberia, and (4) large hydrological systems of small calcareous spring fens with active precipitation of travertine in mountain areas of Slovakia.Results: Different landscape types can sustain similar nutrient poor and base-rich habitats required by endangered fen meadow species. The hydrological systems of these landscapes are very different in size, but their groundwater flow pattern is remarkably similar. Paleo-ecological research showed that travertine forming fen vegetation types persisted in German lowland percolation mires from 6000 to 3000 BP. Similar vegetation types can still be found in small mountain mires in the Slovak Republic. Small pools in such mires form a cascade of surface water bodies that stimulate travertine formation in various ways. Travertine deposition prevents acidification of the mire and sustains populations of basiphilous species that elsewhere in Europe are highly endangered.Conclusion: Very different hydrological landscape settings can maintain a regular flow of groundwater through the top soil generating similar base-rich site conditions. This is why some fen species occur in very different landscape types, ranging from mineral interdunal wetlands to mountain mires."	117	0	0	0	92	0	123	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Natural disturbances and the physiognomy of pine savannas: A phenomenological model	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	9	1	NA	NA	83	96	NA	10.1658/1402-2001(2006)9[83:NDATPO]2.0.CO;2	Article; Proceedings Paper	MAY 2006	2006	"Question: The decline of the Pinus palustris ecosystems has resulted from anthropogenic influences, such as conversion to pine plantation forestry, agriculture and land development, all of which are closely related to increases in human populations. Other effects, however, have arisen from alterations in disturbance regimes that maintain the structure and function of these ecosystems. How have alterations of the disturbance regime altered the physiognomy of 'old-growth' stands, and what are the implications for ecosystem conservation and restoration?Methods: In contrast to models that emphasize close interactions among the vertically complex strata, we develop a conceptual phenomenological model for the physiognomic structure of Pinus palustris stands. We relate two natural disturbances (tropical storms and fire) that affect different stages of the life cycle to different aspects of the physiognomic structure. We then compare overstorey stand structure and ground cover composition of two old-growth longleaf stands near the extremes of different composite disturbance regimes: the Wade Tract (frequent hurricanes and fire) and the Boyd Tract (infrequent hurricanes and long-term fire exclusion).Results: We predict that tropical storms and fires have different effects on stand physiognomy. Tropical storms are periodic, and sometimes intense, whereas fires are more frequent and less intense. Hurricanes directly influence the overstorey via wind-caused damage and mortality, and indirectly influence the herb layer by altering the spatial distribution of shading and litter accumulation. Fire exerts direct effects on juvenile stages and indirect effects on the herb layer via fine fuel consumption and selective mortality of potential competitors of P. palustris juveniles. These differences in effects of disturbances can result in widely different physiognomies for P. palustris stands. Finally, some global climate change scenarios have suggested that changes may occur in tropical storm and fire regimes, altering frequency and severity. Such changes may greatly affect pine stands, and ultimately entire pine savanna ecosystems.Conclusions: Our phenomenological model of disturbance regimes in Pinus palustris old-growth produces very different physiognomies for different disturbances regimes that reflect natural process and human management actions. This model can be used to derive restoration strategies for pine savannas that are linked to reinstitution of important ecological processes rather than specific physiognomic states."	51	0	0	0	45	0	76	2006-05-01	WOS:000242292500011	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

There was very uneven grazing intensity inside the locality, and grazing preference changed during the season: cattle grazed most of the time in productive but species-poor Deschampsia cespitosa swards, but changed to a species-rich Violion caninae stand in the middle of the summer. A species-rich Carex rostrata community was only grazed at the end of the season. Species-poor swards dominated by Nardus stricta and Carex brizoides were mainly used as resting areas. Both grazing and excluding from grazing had a negative effect on species diversity of the Deschampsia cespitosa swards. The soil seed bank contained only few species that are characteristic of mountain grassland communities, and seed dispersal of the target species by cattle dung was also found to be very limited. Thus both grazing and exclusion from grazing are probably of limited value for the restoration of species-rich grasslands from species-poor Deschampsia cespitosa swards in this case."	50	1	0	0	40	0	53	2003-12-01	WOS:000220133300008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

In addition to increasing the primary productivity and the nutrient quality of the regrowth, this burning favours the establishment of opportunistic species, especially the legume Lotus glaber and the thistles Cirsium vulgare and Carduus acanthoides. The aims of the present study were to assess the effects of burning and those of the remnant litter on L. glaber and thistle recruitment, as well as the effects of L. glaber density on the emergence, survival and flowering of thistles. Two field experiments were carried out: 1. A completely randomized factorial design with occurrence of L. glaber and fire was applied in a mature Paspalum stand; 2. A completely randomized design with four L. glaber seed densities oversown on a burned Paspalum stand, as the treatments. Thistle and L. glaber recruitment within the Paspalum stand was dependent on fire, but their emergence in burnt plots was reduced by the presence of remnant litter. Remnant litter and interference from L. glaber provide complementary mechanisms to reduce fire-cued colonization by thistles. While seedling emergence of thistles was mostly affected by the presence of remnant litter, seedling survival depended on local density of L. glaber. By the end of the first post-fire growing season, the survivorship of established thistles was linearly reduced with increasing sowing density and above-ground biomass of L. glaber. The maintenance of a significant litter coverage and a high density of L. glaber in the pre-fire seed bank, as well as the oversowing of L. glaber after fire, may be useful tools in fire management of Paspalum stands aimed to improve their forage value with reduced dependence on chemical control of weeds."	17	0	0	0	13	1	18	2003-06-01	WOS:000186178600004	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The plots, characterized by different habitat conditions, were studied from 1994-2000. The vegetation development on treated plots was compared to untreated plots showing spontaneous succession. For initial treatments we used fresh plant clippings from a species-rich sandy grassland (Armerion elongatae) mowed at the end of July. Soil seed bank samples, taken at the beginning of the experiments and cultivated for 18 months, confirmed that the vegetation development on the slopes started with primary succession. Because seed rain is considered to be an important factor in primary succession, we also studied the diaspore input during the First year. The hospitable Quaternary substrate of Site I (pH = 4.1-4.7, 92% sand) supports fast vegetation development on treated and untreated plots. On treated plots, we have identified plant assemblages similar to initial stages of the Armerion elongatae community. On control plots, Coryne-phorion communities have established spontaneously. At Site 11 (mixed Quaternary and Tertiary substrate, pH = 3.0-3.5, 40% sand) the total cover and number of psammophytic species was low. Treated plots showed development towards ruderal sandy grassland, but the establishment of Calamagrostis epigejos would eventually lead to monodominant stands. Untreated control plots showed basically the same pattern, however the development was slower. At Site III (pH = 1.8-2.8, 34% sand), the hostile Tertiary substrate impeded the succession on both treated and untreated plots because low pH and therefore high amounts of Al3+ produced elemental toxicity to plants. The application of plant clippings accelerated the vegetation development in sites with a pH exceeding 3. On plots with the initial treatment, vegetation cover and total number of species were higher than on untreated plots. The application of fresh plant clippings from areas with similar habitat conditions appears to be a viable alternative to traditional restoration methods."	64	2	0	0	50	0	74	2001-06-01	WOS:000174290900003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Spontaneous succession has accelerated, resulting in extensive degradation of the mire vegetation on both bites and, in particular, widespread expansion of Calluna vulgaris- and Molinia caerulea-dominated vegetation types. Vegetation surveys across strong gradients of change were conducted with the aim of quantifying the extent of early (desirable) and late (undesirable) successional vegetation on both sites. For each site multivariate analyses of the vegetation data were carried out using TWINSPAN, which clearly differentiated higher quality and degraded surfaces. In management terms percentage Sphagnum cover can act as a useful proxy measure of water level and shrub layer height can also serve as a useful indicator of the degree of degradation. A broad-based, five class condition continuum was developed for the Carnwath Moss site. While such an assessment scheme is a somewhat arbitrary means of allocating mesotope areas to specific condition classes, it is rapid to apply and simple enough to be applied by a range of users. A drawback is that the methodology is data-light in temporal terms and is not a long-term substitute for properly-funded monitoring programmes for important sites.

Winter samples were collected in early (November), mid- (February), and late- (April/May) winter, Samples, collected in areas of both high and low muskox density, included Carex aquatilis, unidentified Carex, Salix arctica, Dryas integrifolia, Cassiope tetragona, Saxifraga spp., Astragalus spp., Oxytropis spp., lichen, and grass. Seasonal dynamics in forage quality during the growing season were similar to those reported elsewhere in the arctic and high arctic and were consistent across years.

The quality of forages on Banks Island was similar between areas subjected to different densities of muskox (ca. 1.6-1.9 versus 0.3-0.4/km(2)) implying that quality was not affected by these gazing intensities. The Banks Island high arctic ecosystem supports an abundance of herbivores. It has been hypothesized that this is because forage quality and/or quantity are superior on Banks Island than elsewhere in the high arctic. Our results regarding forage quality are equivocal. Although the maximum CP content of forages from Banks Island was generally higher than reported elsewhere in the arctic and high arctic, CP content reported elsewhere fell within the interannual range reported from Banks Island.

Different aspects are discussed in order to examine the validity and applicability of PNV-maps in landscape planning and nature conservation. PNV-maps are useful for the differentiation of natural and landscape units on a small scale (< 1 : 100 000). However, maps of the potential natural vegetation are less useful for purposes of detailed planning on larger scales (> 1 : 100 000). Problems arise, for example, from the often highly hypothetical character of the construction and the practice of taking remnants of natural vegetation as a reference object for the PNV. With regard to the goals of modern landscape planning and nature conservation purposes (e.g. conserving biodiversity in the cultural landscape of Central Europe) the exact documentation of the actual real vegetation (Lambda RV) on intermediate and large scales gives much more detailed information than a hypothetical PNV."	87	2	0	0	63	4	104	1998-12-01	WOS:000208471900002	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Repeated soil disturbances (e.g., tilling) and nutrient application (e.g., fertilization) common in many agricultural practices are thought to impose barriers limiting initial community reassembly. We experimentally disturbed and applied nutrients in a remnant tallgrass prairie to determine how these drivers influenced growing season trajectory of plant species richness and community composition.Location Texas Blackland Prairie remnant grassland, Southern Great Plains, USA.Methods We performed annual tilling and nutrient addition with a combination of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in a full-factorial experiment that included (n = 5 per treatment): untreated controls (C), nutrient addition only (NPK mu), tilling only (D), and tilling plus nutrient addition (NPK mu + D). Plant species cover was surveyed monthly during two growing seasons to determine plant species richness and composition change. Differences in community composition among treatments were identified by ordination.Results After 2 years of monthly growing season (April-August) plant community sampling, we found that species richness was significantly lower in tilled plots compared to untilled plots. The plant community in the D and NPK mu + D treatment shifted toward annual forb dominance, whereas populations of perennial grasses and forbs persisted in the C and NPK mu treatment. Annual forb dominance was most pronounced in the NPK mu + D treatment, where Ambrosia trifida established in near monocultures and seemingly prevented colonization of other species throughout the growing season. In these plots, species loss was greatest, whereas species gains and rates of composition change were lowest throughout the growing season.Conclusions Our results show annual soil disturbance and nutrient addition controlled the trajectory of growing season plant species richness and community composition by favoring a single dominant annual forb in near-monoculture, which prevented colonization by other species. The early application of practices that reduce soil nutrient availability and increase desired species propagule sources may be needed to prevent monoculture establishment and increase intraannual grassland plant diversity."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-09-28	WOS:001576619300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is grass response the result of differences in the number or the size of plants? Does the response differ over time and in relation to precipitation patterns?LocationSanta Rita Experimental Range, southwestern United States.MethodsFour times between 2011 and 2020, we measured the cover of woody plants and native and non-native perennial grasses, and the density, size, and biomass of individual perennial grasses on 40 permanent transects inside and outside 10 long-term (88-104 years old) livestock exclosures (0.1-4.0 ha) occurring on the same ecological site. We used linear mixed models to compare vegetation variables in grazed vs ungrazed transects through time and calculated the cumulative frequency distributions of grass plant diameters.ResultsThe cover of woody plants did not differ by grazing treatment. Instead, the exclosures had a greater cover, density, and biomass of native grasses and cover and biomass of the most abundant native grass Arizona cottontop (Digitaria californica). Moreover, ungrazed populations of natives and Arizona cottontop showed a plant size structure skewed to larger sizes. Non-native grasses showed no differences between grazing treatments. Patterns of inter-annual precipitation influenced woody and grass plant abundance, but not their response to livestock removal.ConclusionsLong-term grazing removal in desert grasslands affected native grass abundance, but not that of non-native grasses and woody plants. Response of native grasses to livestock removal was characterized more by plant size rather than the number of plants, and, importantly, the population size structure skewed to smaller plants in grazed areas suggests that grazing limits plant vigor and longevity. Absence of a non-native grass response likely reflects lower palatability and greater grazing resistance of non-natives. Absence of woody plant response is due to their low palatability and the permeability of exclosures to seed dispersal."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2023-01-03	WOS:000900132000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Notably, a majority of studies indicate clipping biomass to the ground level without any consideration of the vertical distribution. This study examined the effect of cutting and grazing intensities on the vertical distribution of plant functional groups.Location Oldrichov Grazing Experiment, northern Czechia.Methods During a 15-year experiment: (a) intensive and (b) extensive grazing without cutting; (c) cutting in June followed by intensive and (d) extensive grazing; and (e) undefoliated treatment were applied throughout the vegetation season. Biomass data were collected at two layers in the sward (below and above 3 cm) and separated into five functional groups. Biomass data were analysed to examine the succession and effects of treatments on vertical distribution of functional groups.Results Treatment effects were differentiated after 2-3 years from the introduction of management, but the composition of functional groups fluctuated over time. Treatments significantly affected total biomass of all functional groups and the vertical distribution within swards of most groups. Particularly intensive grazing significantly decreased the total biomass of graminoids, forbs, and dead biomass in favour of legumes (which increased). This led to a shift in the relative biomass distribution from the upper sward layer to the lower layer for most functional groups except for legumes and mosses.Conclusion The high proportion of dead biomass in the lower sward layer suggests the need for a methodological approach that considers clipping of biomass only above 3 cm when sampling for productivity and forage quality analysis. This approach would avoid including biomass from below 3 cm or the lower layer, which would be ungrazed by cattle. Many previous studies may have reported a distorted or inflated value in herbage productivity or forage quality results."	4	0	0	0	4	0	4	2021-04-25	WOS:000636291500023	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We ask: is the divergent species origin response due to fundamental differences in germination cues and/or safe -sites for establishment? Location Temperate grassy woodlands, southern Victoria, Australia. Methods We quantified patch type frequency in the field. Diurnal temperature effects on four native annual forbs and three exotic annual grasses were assessed in a laboratory germination trial. We used a glasshouse experiment to assess the effects of patch type (bare ground, tree litter, grass litter, moss mat) on the emergence and growth of two native and two exotic annuals. Results Exotic annuals typically had higher and more rapid germination across a wider range of diurnal temperatures than native annuals. Emergence of native and exotic annuals was highest on bare ground patches but was suppressed by leaf litter and moss mat. Native annuals did not emerge from under a moss mat and germinated much less than exotics in all patch types. Seedling growth of native annuals was suppressed by tree litter whereas growth of exotic species was not suppressed by litter or the moss mat. Conclusions The regeneration niche of the native annual forb species we examined was typically narrower than that of exotic annual grasses. Many of the differences in response between native and exotic species may be due to seed traits such as seed mass; native annuals have much smaller seeds than exotic annual species. This likely affects the persistence, germination cues, co-existence and restoration potential of native annuals in fragmented grassy woodlands that have lost their endogenous disturbance agents."	6	0	0	0	6	0	7	2020-08-05	WOS:000551595900001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We tested for associations between different aspects of the recent fire history and plant species richness and composition, and whether these relationships were consistent among structurally defined forest, woodland and heath vegetation types.ResultsThe relationship between fire regime variables and plant species richness and composition differed among vegetation types, despite the three vegetation types having similar species pools. Fire frequency was positively related to species richness in woodland, negatively related to species richness in heath, and unrelated to species richness in forest. These different relationships were explained by differences in the associations between fire history and species traits among vegetation types. The negative relationship between fire frequency and species richness in heath vegetation was underpinned by reduced occurrence of resprouting species at high fire frequency sites (more than four fires in 55years). However, in forest and woodland vegetation, resprouting species were not negatively associated with fire frequency.ConclusionsWe hypothesize that differing relationships among vegetation types were underpinned by differences in fire behaviour, and/or biotic and abiotic conditions, leading to differences in plant species mortality and post-fire recovery among vegetation types. Our findings suggest that even when there is a high proportion of shared species between vegetation types, fires can have very different effects on vegetation communities, depending on the structural vegetation type. Both research and management of fire regimes may therefore benefit from considering vegetation types as separate management units."	26	0	0	0	19	1	29	2018-12-28	WOS:000425120600015	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We used GLM to determine whether native and exotic species richness and abundance varied along gradients of inundation and land use.ResultsSpecies richness and plant abundance in soil propagule banks were positively related to inundation and negatively related to intense historic land use. The abundance of native species was significantly higher in more frequently inundated areas. Abundances of exotic and ruderal species were higher in areas of intense prior land use. Overall species richness was generally similar across land-use histories.ConclusionsLand-use legacies compromised the ability of propagule banks to rejuvenate native vegetation in this floodplain wetland, especially in less frequently flooded parts of the floodplain, which harboured more ruderal and exotic species. Negative effects of prior land use may be alleviated by increased inundation. Native soil propagule banks were remarkably intact, providing a reservoir for restoration of wetland vegetation, even in soils highly disturbed by up to 20yr of agricultural cropping.

We counted the number of flowering species, as well as the number of flowering stalks.ResultsGraminoid species flowered in highest numbers 1yr after fire, whilst forbs had more species flowering just after fire, indicating different reproductive strategies in post-fire environments.

Finally, the different functional groups showed different flowering responses to time since last fire and to the different types of management.ConclusionsOur results show fire stimulated flowering. Although mowing can be a good alternative for maintaining plant diversity, our study showed that this practice is not as efficient as fire in stimulating flowering.

Methods Above-ground biomass (dry weight; g center dot m-2) was regressed against the following explanatory variables: (1) Cover E1, total percentage cover of the herb layer visually estimated in the field; (2) Biomass estimate-raw, -adjusted and -median, calculated from plant covers and heights (according to a local flora); and (3) mean EIVs Nutrients calculated per plot. For the analyses, we used four data sets containing a total of 469 plots from different vegetation types: Wet meadows, Dry grasslands, Fendry grassland transects and Forest herb layer. To test the applicability of different biomass estimates we chose an example of a species richnessproductivity relationship in the Wet meadows data set and describe differences in resulting patterns. Results Both cover of herb layer and calculated biomass volumes were more accurate in predicting biomass dry weight than EIVs Nutrients. The best results were obtained from the Biomass estimate-median model that combines median stand height and total cover of the herb layer. Cover E1 showed relatively tight correlations with biomass, particularly in sparse vegetation, but was a rather poor predictor when cover values were high. This was especially noticeable in application of the Cover E1 model in analysis of the species richnessproductivity relationship. Conclusions In contrast to biomass, cover of the herb layer has a fixed upper limit (100%), which may lead to misinterpretations in dense, structurally diverse vegetation. Most promising is the Biomass estimate-median method, which can be applied both to already sampled plots by calculating median height from average species heights according to local floras and to newly sampled plots using the median of plant heights measured in the field.

Nitrogen, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg concentrations and C/N ratios were determined in both vegetation and soil. Differences between management groups were evaluated.Results: Comparison among different management groups revealed several differences in both relative and total amount of nutrients in soil and vegetation. Most soil properties of restored sites were similar to those in abandoned sites. Carbon stock in the soil profile doubled after abandonment, total N concentration in the top soil layer increased while plant available P concentration decreased. The phytomass and chemical composition of phytomass rapidly changed back to a 'normal' level after restoration. Species composition remained different, but species typical of coastal grasslands were present in restored sites. There was a strong site specificity in the results.Conclusions: Re-establishment of grazing had a rapid impact on plant biomass of coastal grasslands. Species composition responded more slowly, but target species returned relatively quickly. Slow recovery of soil properties, however, means that the results of restoration may be fragile and return of tall-growth vegetation is very probable if managent intensity declines.

For each species relative survival, competitive performance and relationships with plant traits were measured. Results: PPC exerted strong dominance on most of its neighbouring species. Survival performance of Anthyllis vulneraria, Luzula sudetica and Lotus alpinus were dramatically reduced.Results of above-ground competition showed that species were trapped in asymmetric competition.

The actual vegetation was related to a set of phytosociological references representing the subassociations of the community. DCA positions of reference releves from the different subassociations were overlapping, suggesting that in all references many common species occur. Recent records were positioned in-between the seed bank samples and the references. The soil seed banks of all stands were dominated by ordinary species.

Two experiments were established on contrasting sites to investigate cost-effective methods for the re-establishment of vegetation dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather), which is the usual target community seen as the desired replacement for Pteridium aquilinum in the uplands by many land managers. At one site, where grazing intensity was low and shelter was sufficient to prevent rapid Pteridium litter loss, the necessary treatments to establish Calluna were to disturb the litter and add a source of Calluna seeds. A difference between continued Pteridium control or a relaxation of control was not observed over the time-scale of the experiment. At the second site, where grazing intensity was high and shelter minimal, vegetation dominated by Rumex acetosella had developed on a thin but dense litter layer. To enhance Calluna regeneration it was necessary to prevent sheep grazing, disturb the remaining litter layer and add a source of Calluna propagules. A nurse crop hindered Calluna establishment due to its vigorous growth. At neither site was an initial application of fertilizer an aid to Calluna establishment. It is possible to devise methods for the re-establishment of Calluna at sites where previous attempts at Pteridium control alone have not had the desired effect on vegetation development. However, the precise choice of methods used is dependent on the grazing management at the site. High levels of livestock grazing prevented Calluna establishment, but some trampling may aid litter breakdown. The ability to adjust stocking rates and access to the site by machinery are critical factors to take into account in producing an effective strategy for long-term Pteridium control and its replacement by target vegetation."	17	4	0	0	13	1	22	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In two fen areas of northeastern Germany, different techniques of re-introduction to establish reed-bed species in formerly intensively used, species-poor, grasslands, after rewetting, were studied under three hydrological regimes (permanent inundation, temporary inundation, border irrigation) with the aims (1) to establish peat-forming vegetation and (2) to enhance species richness. Establishment was successful for nearly all species investigated under all hydrological variants. There were differences between individuals sown and those which had been planted. Wet, but not inundated soil linked with vegetation gaps create safe sites which enable successful germination and seedling establishment. The survival rate for both planted and sown individuals was generally high, with the exception of Cladium mariscus, Eupatorium cannabinum and Phragmites australis Recommendations for restoration management include the establishment of the following successful species: Carex acutiformis, C elata and C paniculata to establish peat-forming vegetation; Iris pseudacorus, Lysimachia vulgaris, Lythrum salicaria to enhance species richness."	24	0	0	0	20	0	28	1999-05-01	WOS:000208472000016	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The species which were introduced were Carex rostrata, Eriophorum angustifolium, E. vaginatum, Calluna vulgarisand Molinia caerulea. Depending on the peat quality, simple ditch blocking and terracing did not always guarantee the retention of rainwater on the restoration site. Accelerated vegetation establishment was possible either by planting (introduced species) or by sowing. Covering the seeds with fibre mats or mulch increased seed germination but not the establishment of seedlings. Rapid revegetation of bare peat could be achieved using a mulch of seed-rich hay.

However, the relevance of the geographical scale at which floristic changes are observed is less well understood and it has only rarely been possible to quantify biodiversity loss. Therefore, we assessed changes in species richness, species composition and mean ecological indicator values (EIVs) at three nested geographic scales during two different time periods, each ca 30 years, since the mid-1900s.LocationTwo parishes in central Scania, southernmost Sweden.MethodsWe analyzed species presence/absence data from three inventories at ca 30-year intervals over 1957-2021 and three geographic scales (157 m(2), ca 7 km(2) and ca 45 km(2)) to document temporal trends and differences between geographic scales in terms of species richness, species composition and mean EIVs.ResultsWe found shifts in species composition across all geographical scales. However, the magnitude of biodiversity loss and the main drivers of these changes were scale-dependent. At the smallest spatial scale, we saw a dramatic loss of plant biodiversity with local species richness in 2021 being only 48% of that of 1960. In contrast, at the larger geographic scales no significant changes in species richness were observed because species losses were compensated for by gains of predominantly non-native species, which made up at least 78% of the new species richness. At the smallest spatial scale, changed land use (ceased grazing/mowing and intensified forestry) appeared as the main driver, while an increasing proportion of non-native species, as well as climatic changes and increasing nitrogen loads appeared relatively more important at larger geographic scales.ConclusionOur results highlight the precarious situation for biodiversity in the region and at the same time the fundamental importance of geographic scale in studies of biodiversity change. Both the magnitude and drivers of changes may differ depending on the geographic scale and must be considered also when previously published studies are interpreted."	4	0	0	0	4	0	5	2023-09-25	WOS:000999137400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Many historical vegetation surveys applied cover abundance, relative occurrence or density scales (species-quantity scales) that are nowadays poorly known and consequently disregarded or misinterpreted. Therefore, it is worthwhile to put effort into making them compatible with the datasets sampled using mainstream methods. Within Europe, this especially applies to historical data from Fennoscandia. Here, we aim to propose how to transform the species-quantity scales frequently used in Fennoscandia into percentage cover scales, based on the conversion of their individual grades. Study area Fennoscandia, including Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Fennoscandian part of Russia (Republic of Karelia, Karelian Isthmus, Murmansk Region). Methods and results We inventoried Fennoscandian vegetation plot studies and identified that the most frequently applied species-quantity scales were those of Norrlin, Hult-Sernander and Drude. We reviewed the definitions and applications of these scales in the literature and, if not available, calculated hypothetical species covers to approximate realistic conversions to the percentage scale. As a result, we propose alternative ways of conversion of the individual scale grades to mid-percentage cover values. Conclusion Historical vegetation plot data from Fennoscandia can be used as quantitative information for vegetation research if their grades are consistently transformed into percentage cover values using the proposals presented in this paper."	10	0	0	0	10	0	10	2019-09-30	WOS:000486543400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We predict that if germination from heathland seed banks is in part regulated by fire cues, there should be stronger responses to fire cue treatments in seed bank samples taken from heath that has not been recently burned in comparison with samples taken from newly burned heath, where seed banks have been exposed to the same cues in situ.LocationLygra, Lindas commune, western Norway.MethodsThe efficacy of smoke, charred wood, ash and heat in promoting germination has been documented in a wide range of species and systems, but relatively little work has been done on fire-related cues in northern European heathlands under anthropogenic fire regimes. We studied fire experimentally by testing the effects of aqueous smoke solution, ash and a combination of the two treatments, on the germination of graminoids, herbs and ericads. A greenhouse germination trial compared seed banks from old heath (28yr since the last fire) with seed banks from newly burned heath (burned the previous year), where we expected that fire-cued germination had already occurred.ResultsWe found that both ericads and graminoids responded to fire cues, whereas herbs did not. In line with our predictions, responses were stronger in the old heath than in the young heath. Further, the smoke treatment is a more effective cue than ash across all functional groups.ConclusionsThe prevalence of positive fire cue responses across functional groups underscores the importance of fire in the ecology of these heathlands, and hence of burning as a central tool for their management. The finding that the germination response is stronger in naive seed banks than in seed banks that have already been exposed to recent fire cues through in situ fires further supports the role of fire in the successional dynamics of these heathlands."	27	0	0	0	20	0	29	2014-11-05	WOS:000342839200008	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How can modelling be used as a decision-making tool?LocationThe study was conducted in the megalithic site of Carnac (Brittany, France). Due to over-frequentation (more than 500000visitors center dot yr(-1)) and lack of adapted management, the vegetation (heathlands and grasslands) of the site, which constitutes not only the framework of the monument, but also an essential protection for archaeological soils, was highly damaged during the 1980s. In order to initiate restoration of the vegetation, the whole site was fenced at the beginning of the 1990s, and a management plan (including vegetation management and frequentation control) was initiated in 2001.MethodsThe site has been mapped (with the same methodology) in 1985 (before enclosure), 1997 (5yrs after fencing), 2006 (after 5yrs of management plan application) and in 2012. GIS analysis and transition matrix modelling were used to describe vegetation dynamics changes in both time and space. Restoration trajectories were considered in two specific parts of the study site, which are analysed both together and separately in order to show potential spatial heterogeneity in vegetation dynamics.ResultsThe matrices approach underlined the heterogeneity of restoration process within the study site. The restoration process leads to the establishment of a complex of grassland with a potential dynamic toward broom thicket in one area, and to a heathland complex in the other area. These differences are needed to refine restoration goals, first defined as heathland for the whole site.ConclusionsThe matrix approach used on vegetation maps allows a more precise description of restoration processes than analysis only based on the evolution of the extent of each vegetation type. It notably includes the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation dynamics at site scale. It provides large data sets for qualitative assessment of restoration operations, and could potentially be used to build up prediction models. Indeed, maps, which are one of the main survey methods used in natural areas management, can offer much scientific knowledge for research in restoration ecology."	9	1	0	0	5	0	10	2014-04-30	WOS:000332774800005	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The percentage of undamaged seeds in the goat faeces was calculated at different times of collection following ingestion. Recovered seeds were tested for germination and viability, alongside seeds taken directly from the fruit. Intact and artificially cracked faecal pellets, collected from grazed natural areas, were kept in a greenhouse while seedling emergence was quantified. After 103d, all cactus seeds that remained within the faecal pellets were recovered and their germination capacity was compared to that of the seeds taken directly from fruits.Results: For the four species, between 28% and 61% of the seeds ingested were later recovered in the faecal pellets. No significant differences were found between species in the proportion of seeds retrieved during each collection time point. However, the time interval between ingestion and collection significantly influenced the number of seeds retrieved, peaking at between 16-32hr. The digestion process significantly decreased the seed germination rate. Cactus germination from cracked faecal pellets was significantly higher than from intact pellets. Both contained viable seeds of all four cactus species, but particularly E.platyacanthus f.grandis.Conclusions: Domestic goats are potential dispersers of the studied cactus species, although degradation of the faecal pellets is necessary to fully permit seedling emergence. These findings should be taken into account when designing management plans to conserve these endangered species."	7	0	0	0	7	2	8	2013-10-01	WOS:000324090800003	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is the rate of succession increasing or decreasing along a gradient from low to high fertility? Location Ecological field station Dahlem, Berlin, Germany. Methods An 18-yr permanent plot study of succession on soils of differing fertility. The original substrates were a nutrient-poor sandy soil from a sandpit, ruderal subsoil of moderate fertility and nutrient-rich topsoil. Results In plots with sand, monocarpic perennials were dominant at the beginning, which were then replaced by perennial grasses, those being then replaced by woody perennials. On ruderal soil, monocarpic perennials were co-dominant with perennial herbs at first, then were replaced by perennial herbs, which were then also replaced by woody plants. Dominance of woody species was attained after about 10yr, both on sand and on ruderal soil. In plots with topsoil, there was a short phase at the start where monocarpic perennials were co-dominant with perennial herbs, followed by a relatively long period of perennial herb dominance. There were about twice as many woody species growing on the substrates of low and intermediate fertility compared to the nutrient-rich soil. If we compare the time necessary for woody species to reach 10% and 50% cover, woody colonization was much slower on the resource-rich site. DCA ordination revealed a clear separation of samples along the nutrient gradient. It also showed slower community change with increasing soil fertility. Conclusions This study demonstrates that woodlands can be created on bare ground in a temperate climate through natural colonization in a relatively short time, if substrates are not too nutrient-rich. The assumption that the rate of succession increases with increasing productivity could not be confirmed. Succession towards woodland can be rapid on soils of low and intermediate fertility. In contrast, a nutrient-rich substrate favours perennial herbaceous vegetation, which inhibits woody colonization and arrests succession."	25	0	0	0	20	1	28	2013-07-10	WOS:000319885000003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Second, we examined how these weather variables varied historically in Temiscamingue and, third, how they may change between the present and 2100 according to different scenarios of climate change based on two Global Circulation Models.Results: Mean monthly temperature maxima during the fire season (Apr-Oct) and weighted sequences of dry spells best explained fire occurrence and area burned. Between 1910 and 2004, mean monthly temperature maxima in Temiscamingue showed no apparent temporal trend, while dry spell sequences decreased in frequency and length. All future scenarios show an increase in mean monthly temperature maxima, and one model scenario forecasts an increase in dry spell sequences, resulting in a slight increase in forecasted annual area burned.Conclusion: Despite the forecasted increase in fire activity, effects of climate change on fire will not likely affect forest structure and composition as much as natural succession or harvesting and other disturbances, principally because or the large relative difference in area affected by these processes"	19	1	0	0	13	0	21	2009-08-01	WOS:000268571000001	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Environmental variables were recorded at each plot, and soil samples were analysed for exchangeable P and N. as well as limestone content and pH. Data were analysed with regression analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.Results: Plant species richness was highest on weakly acid to slightly alkaline soil; a number of nationally red-listed species showed a similar pattern. Plant species diversity and number of red-listed species increased with slope. Where the topsoil had been acidified, limestone was rarely present above a depth of 30 cm. The presence of limestone restricts the availability of soil P, placing a major constraint on primary productivity in sandy soils.Conclusions: Acidification of sandy grasslands leads to reduced abundance of desirable species, although the overall effect is rather weak between pH 5 and pH 9.

Soil conditions included mineral (calcareous and non-calcareous) soils with no initial vegetation, mineral soils with established vegetation and organic soils with vegetation.Results: The responsiveness of traits to raised groundwater tables was related to soil type and vegetation presence and depended on actual groundwater levels. In the moist-wet zone, oligotrophic species, 'drier' species with higher seed longevity occupied gaps created by vegetation dieback on rewetting.

Instead, depending on drainage intensity and microtopography, acidification may trigger a shift into drier and more nutrient-poor plant communities.Location: Nature reserve, central Netherlands, 5 m a.s.l.Methods: Long-term study (1988-1997) in a fen meadow along a gradient in drainage intensity at different scales.Results: Above-ground biomass increased only slightly over ten years, despite a lower summer groundwater table. The accountable factors were probably a limited availability of nutrients (K in the higher well-drained plots, P in the intermediate plots and N in the lower hardly drained plots), plus removal of hay.Junco-Molinion species increased in dry sites and Parvocaricetea species increased in wet sites, presumably primarily because of soil acidification occurring when rainwater becomes more influential than base-rich groundwater. The extent of the shift in species composition depends primarily on the drainage intensity and secondarily on microtopography. Local hydrological measures have largely failed to restore wetter and more basic-rich conditions.Conclusions: Acidification and nutrient removal, leaching and immobilization resulted in the succession towards Junco-Molinion at the cost of Calthion palustris elements.

However, as roads are transport corridors for humans and their vehicles; species survival is affected through destruction, fragmentation and modification of remaining habitat by human activity. Few studies have recognised the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, in the form of historical roadworks activities, on adjacent roadside plant populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soil disturbance from roadworks on the spatial patterns and structural dynamics of roadside Acacia populations in an agricultural area in southeastern Australia. Stem size and disturbance data were collected from 135 roadside populations of three species of Acacia shrubs in the Lockhart Shire area. Spatial pattern analysis using the Network K-function and Discriminant Function analyses showed that road verge width, road category, disturbance intensity and distance to nearest town were highly significant variables in relation to disturbance from roadworks and shrub structural dynamics. Colonising populations were more abundant along gravel roads where soil disturbance intensity was high, whereas stable populations were more abundant where soil disturbance intensity was low. Senescent populations were more abundant in narrow, little used road verge corridors 4-6 km from nearby towns. These results suggest that anthropogenic disturbance regimes may be critical to shrub recruitment and persistence in roadside environments, which has important consequences for conservation of threatened native flora and fauna in agricultural landscapes."	2	0	0	0	2	0	2	2004-05-01	BCI:BCI200400334230	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This paper provides an evaluation of the ecological changes resulting from succession of poor fen (base-poor mire) to willow wet woodland on Goss Moor NNR in Cornwall, UK. Different ages of willow carr were associated with eight understorey communities. During willow colonization, in the ground flora, there was a progressive decrease in poor fen species and an associated increase in woodland species, which appeared to be related to an increase in canopy cover and therefore shade. The most diverse community was found to be the most recent willow and was dominated by poor fen species. The oldest willow was the second most diverse and was associated with a reduction in poor fen species and an increase in woodland species. Architectural features were used successfully to assess the general condition and structure of willow. Tree height and DBH were identified as useful parameters to accurately assess willow age in the field. The implications of active intervention to remove willow in order to conserve the full range of communities within the hydrosere are discussed."	10	0	0	0	8	0	11	2003-06-01	WOS:000186178600007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To define the alternative states and thresholds for these ecosystems, we examined burning and water table effects on both abiotic variables and establishment of grasses adapted to relatively high (Poa secunda ssp. juncifolia), intermediate (Leymus triticoides), or low (L. cinercus) water tables. Wet sites had lower soil temperatures and higher soil water contents than dry sites. Burning increased soil temperatures on all sites. Undershrub microsites on control plots had the lowest temperatures, while former undershrub microsites on burn plots had the highest temperatures. Surface soil water was low on burn plots early in the growing season due to desiccation, but higher at deeper depth,, after active plant growth began. Emergence was generally greater on wet sites, but survival was microsite- and species-specific. Undershrub microsites on control plots facilitated emergence and first-year survival, but seedlings that survived initially harsh conditions on burn plots had similar numbers alive at the end. In general, favorable environments and establishment of species adapted to mesic conditions indicate that wet sites represent an alternative state of the naturally occurring dry meadow ecosystem type, and can be restored to grass and sedge meadows. Harsh environments and lack of establishment of species adapted to mesic conditions indicate that dry sites have crossed a threshold and may represent a new ecosystem type. Understory vegetation and seed banks on dry sites have been depleted, arid restoration will require burning and reseeding with species adapted to more xeric conditions."	36	0	0	0	22	0	43	2001-12-01	WOS:000174291000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Until the second World War these meadows were mown in mid-surnmer and grazed by cattle for the rest of the season. Subsequent abandonment of the meadows has resulted in decreasing species richness. Degradation phases of the former communities have been replacing the original species-rich vegetation. Significant changes were apparent six years after the introduction of sheep grazing. In grazed plots the proportion of dominant herbs (Polygonum bistorta and Hypericum maculatum) decreased and grasses (Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca rubra, Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxonthum alpinum) increased. The increase in grasses was positively correlated with an increase in several herbs. The proportion of some herbs increased despite being selectively grazed (Adenostyles alliariae, Melandrium rubrium, Veratrum lobelianum). Any losses caused by grazing of mature plants were probably compensated by successful seedling establishment. Cessation of grazing resulted in significant changes in vegetation within three years. The cover of nitrophilous tall herbs and grasses (e.g. Rumex alpestris, Holcus mollis, Deschampsia cespitosa, Geranium sylvaticum) increased in the abandoned plots. In the plots grazed for nine years cover of species-rich mountain meadow species increased (e.g. fine-leaved grasses, Campanula bohenica, Potentilla aurea, Viola lutea, Silene vulgaris). The main conservation risk is the expansion of a competitive species with low palatability, Deschampsia cespitosa, This species can be suppressed by a combination of grazing and mowing. In order for grazing to be effective, the number of sheep should be proportional to meadow production. This may be difficult to maintain as production is variable and is impossible to predict at the beginning of a growing season. A large part of the biomass may thus remain intact in some years. Negative effects of grazing may be, at least partly, eliminated C by a combination of cutting and grazing."	111	0	0	0	88	0	123	2001-06-01	WOS:000174290900012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

In this study we present a new method for predicting the occurrences of species using data from deciduous forests in South Sweden. Complete species lists of vascular plants were compiled from 101 stands and from representative sample plots inside the stands. Soil samples from each stand were collected for determination of pH and nitrogen mineralization. Presence-absence data for species were fitted to the values of four environmental variables - soil moisture, soil reaction (pH), soil nitrogen and light - by means of Linear (Multiple) Logistic Regression (LLR), and Gaussian (Multiple) Logistic Regression (GLR). First, these values were estimated by calculating the weighted averages of Ellenberg indicator values. Second, the estimates for reaction and nitrogen were substituted by the real measurements of pH and mineralized NH4+, keeping the Ellenberg estimates for light and moisture. The models were validated by an independent test data set. In general, the models had high predictive abilities. GLR fitted the species occurrences better to the environmental variables than LLR, but had a lower accuracy of prediction of species occurrence in the stands. The use of soil measurements instead of Ellenberg indicator values did not improve the predictive abilities of the models. The environmental conditions in the stand test set were successfully estimated by using species data from the plots. When using the species lists of the stands instead of plot data, a slightly better predictive ability was obtained. The collection of plot data, however, is easier and less time-consuming. The accuracy of prediction differed considerably between species."	42	0	0	0	23	0	45	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	YES

Here, we ask whether geologic refugia (e.g., tall boulders) will provide a haven for vulnerable plant species to escape browsing pressure from high populations of native deer.LocationHuron Mountains, Michigan, USA.MethodsWe compared the percent cover, species richness, and Shannon diversity of all plant species on tall boulders to adjacent fenced exclosures and to forest floor reference plots to quantify the degree to which deer impact one of the largest remaining tracts of old-growth forests in the Eastern United States.ResultsWe found that boulders contained 60% higher richness and diversity than reference plots, as well as a more diverse mix of midstory species, shrubs, and forbs. Seven-year-old exclosure and reference plots were nearly indistinguishable from each other and were dominated by Acer saccharum and other browse-tolerant species.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that boulders are a highly effective, though rarely used, proxy or bioassay of the degree to which chronic overbrowsing creates impoverished understories composed of browse-tolerant or unpalatable species.

Legume abundance is commonly low in N-enriched environments because of competition with grasses and non-legume forbs. Both haying and livestock grazing remove plant biomass and reduce light limitation to plant growth, with the difference that livestock may selectively consume legumes. This study examines how legumes respond to grazing, haying and fertilization, and what mechanisms explain legume abundance in rangelands.Location: Flooding Pampa, Argentina.Methods: We performed two manipulation field experiments over 3 years. First, a factorial of rangeland management (intact, haying, or grazing) under two nutrient levels (ambient and increased N, phosphorus [P] and potassium [K]); and second, a factorial of rangeland management (intact or haying) and N x P addition. We evaluated legume, grass and non-legume forb abundance and ground-level light in three to five replicates of our experiments over 3 years.ResultsNPK fertilization increased legume abundance consistently under grazing, and temporarily under haying, but had no effect in the intact grassland. Also, P addition increased legume abundance only under haying when N was not added. Temporal changes in legume abundance were positively associated with changes in ground-level light, which increased with haying and grazing, but decreased with fertilization in the intact grassland, and negatively with grass abundance.Conclusions: The negative effects of nutrients on legume abundance were offset by the positive effects of livestock. The reduction in grass competition and increase in ground-level light due to grazing and haying explained the positive responses of legume abundance to nutrients in this temperate grassland. Our results highlight the importance of considering the interactive response of legume abundance to grazing and fertilization, which are becoming common practices in rangelands."	5	0	0	0	2	0	5	2023-11-30	WOS:001105581500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

A rapid method for quantifying small-scale vegetation patch structure to complement conventional quadrat surveys	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	24	3	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12610	10.1111/avsc.12610	Article	JUL 2021	2021	"Aims Vegetation sampling typically involves the use of quadrats to estimate species cover abundance. Such surveys do not generally record small-scale vegetation patch structure at sub-quadrat scales. Here we test a simple method to quantify patch structure that complements conventional techniques. We compare the two methods, and analyse metrics derived from small-scale patch surveys with environment/management data. Location Northumberland, United Kingdom. Methods We recorded cover abundance of all species in an upland moor with 1-m(2) quadrats. These were divided into 100 'sub-quadrats', 10 cm x 10 cm, and the dominant and subdominant species identified. Patch metrics (number, area and shape) for individual species recorded as dominant or subdominant in the subquadrat survey were analysed using multi-variate generalised linear models with environmental and management data. Sub-quadrat data were also aggregated for each quadrat, to create species composition data. The two sets of compositional data, from whole-quadrat and sub-quadrat aggregations, were compared via Procrustes rotation of ordination scores. Results Patch number, area and shape for dominant and subdominant species were all significantly affected by soil pH, soil water content, slope and elevation. Effects of proximity to sheep tracks and drainage ditches were less consistent amongst species. Ordinations of vegetation data from conventional and sub-quadrats were similar, with significant Procrustes R-2 of 67% and 70% for dominant and subdominant species respectively. Conclusions Sub-quadrat surveys can easily be used to complement existing whole-quadrat surveys at little cost in time or resources. Their patch metrics can provide additional insights into the environmental and management drivers that may affect the growth of individual plants or clumps, potentially in relation to plant traits, and thus alter the overall community composition. The methods we describe can readily be adapted to other sizes of quadrats and sub-quadrats in a wide range of vegetation communities."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Simultaneously, various land use practices cause disturbance to the vegetation. However, not much documentation exists on how long-term intensive land use disturbance modifies high-latitude vegetation under climate warming. Here, we study how the composition of boreal mountain plant communities has changed during three decades in response to heavy land use disturbance, related to ski resort construction and management, and how these changes compare to those observed in adjacent less disturbed communities. Location Iso-Syote, Finland. Methods We resurveyed vegetation along four elevational gradients (240-426 m a.s.l.) on a boreal mountain in 2013-14. After the original study in 1980, half of the gradients were subjected to continuous heavy land use disturbance, while the other half remained only slightly disturbed. All the gradients experienced a similar amount of macroclimatic warming over time. We analysed temporal changes in plant group covers, species richness and species' elevational range means in relation to disturbance levels and elevation. Results Under slight disturbance, the cover of shrubs increased on the originally open upper slopes and elevational range means of several species shifted upward. In contrast, heavy disturbance resulted in a uniform, yet modest, shrub cover increase along the whole elevational gradient and promoted both up- and downward shifts of species. Bryophyte cover decreased considerably over time, regardless of the disturbance level. Species richness increased throughout, yet more under heavy disturbance. Conclusions Long-term changes in boreal mountain vegetation are substantially influenced by heavy land use disturbance compared to less disturbed sites where the vegetation changes are more comparable to those expected under a warmer climate. Therefore, along with the climatic effects, land use effects on vegetation are important to consider in management actions and in projections of future vegetation."	8	0	0	0	6	0	9	2021-04-01	WOS:000667075000005	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Methods We analyzed the PROSPECT-5 and Invertible Forest Reflectance Model (INFORM) biophysical parameters as retrieved from canopy reflectance data of different forest plots (using Sentinel-2 images for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019) as optical trait indicators (OTIs). We successively tested the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) for each retrieved OTI using the Rao's Q as heterogeneity index, validating them against Shannon's H values calculated as a tree species diversity index derived from in-situ collected data. Results We demonstrated differences among OTIs in terms of how well their variations can be linked to species diversity. In particular the variations of brown pigments (Cbrown), carotenoids (Car) and chlorophyll content (Cab) can be considered the most relevant OTIs for the application of the SVH when using the Rao's Q as a proxy for tree species diversity in our study site.

The aim of this study was to better understand tropical forest succession under a passive restoration scenario. We compared floristic and functional attributes of seedlings in a passively restored and an old-growth forest, and assessed the effect of restoration age and distance from the old-growth forest on seedling attributes.Location: Kibale National Park, western Uganda.Methods: We measured seedlings in a passively restored and an old-growth forest in 2011, 2014 and 2017. We determined species diversity, structure and composition and searched the literature for functional traits. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to compare seedling attributes between the restored and old-growth forest and determine the influence of restoration age and distance from the old-growth forest.Results: Seedling species abundance, evenness, basal area and height were similar between the restored and old-growth forest. Wood density and abundance of seedlings of different dispersal modes, habitat types, fruit size categories, and regeneration strategies were also similar between the restored and old-growth forest. However, richness, diversity and composition of seedlings were different. We found a positive effect of restoration age on species abundance and abundance of non-zoochorous, medium-fruited, forest-dependent, non-pioneer light demander and shade-tolerant species, and a negative effect on evenness, wood density, abundance of pioneers and compositional dissimilarity. Basal area of seedlings and the abundance of zoochorous and forest-dependent species declined while compositional dissimilarity increased with distance from the old-growth forest.Conclusions: Our results provide empirical evidence on the potential of passive restoration to recover the structure and functionality of tropical forests in a relatively short period of time. We demonstrate that the effect of restoration age and distance from the old-growth forest is not straightforward and depends on the attributes measured."	5	0	0	0	5	0	5	2021-01-25	WOS:000605995900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This also applies to the Caatinga, a unique seasonally dry tropical forest in northeastern Brazil. It is considered one of the most threatened ecosystems of Brazil. To protect semi-arid regions from biodiversity loss, degradation, and desertification, sustainable management practices are urgently needed. However, the effect of different grazing intensities on plant diversity is not yet fully understood. In this study, we examined the effect of different grazing intensities on plant species composition, alpha and beta diversity. Location Vicinity of the Itaparica Reservoir, northeastern Brazil. Methods We assessed the effects of different grazing intensities (high, intermediate, no/low) on species composition, alpha and beta diversity of the tree and shrub, and the herb layer in a Caatinga area. Plant diversity of the tree and shrub layer was assessed on 45 study plots (each 20 m x 20 m), while the diversity of herbs was studied on a subset of 36 plots (four subplots, each 2 m x 2 m). Results In total, we recorded 140 plant taxa including morphospecies. Grazing at high intensities significantly reduced almost all measures of alpha and beta diversity (tree and shrub layer) compared to areas with no or low grazing. In contrast, species composition was not significantly related to grazing but instead to altitude, which serves as an indicator of reduced anthropogenic impact such as slash-and-burn agriculture or tree harvesting. Conclusion Overall, the study results show that the current livestock management has negative effects on plant diversity in Caatinga ecosystems. These results have been incorporated into guidelines provided to regional stakeholders including recommendations for adapted land-management practices that protect and foster the biodiversity of dry forests while sustaining local livelihoods."	38	2	0	0	27	1	44	2019-04-01	WOS:000466383400014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Because snow-meadow vegetation is particularly sensitive to climate change, species composition and community structure may have changed over the last few decades in response to global warming. The aim of the present study is to quantify changes in species diversity and snow-meadow community composition over the last 40 years.Location: Taisetsu Mountains, Hokkaido, Japan.Methods: The presence and ground cover of plant species were surveyed in two snow-meadow sites in 1971-1972 (44 and 113 plots) and 2012 (85 and 115 plots). In addition, soil moisture and snowmelt time were measured in every plot in 2012. Changes in species richness, functional types and species composition between the survey periods were analysed.Results: Community structure of snow-meadow vegetation has changed significantly. Although the total number of species at each site was the same between the survey periods, Shannon's diversity index and species richness per plot have increased. Moreover, similarity in species composition among community types has been enhanced, indicating the mosaic structure of alpine vegetation has become obscure. The relative dominance of forbs (particularly tall herbaceous species) decreased, while that of shrubs increased. The distribution of community types reflected the snowmelt and soil moisture conditions.Conclusions: Significant changes have occurred in vegetation structure in the alpine snow-meadows, possibly due to accelerated snow melt and drier soil conditions linked to global warming. To predict the dynamics of alpine vegetation, we need to clarify how micro-scale heterogeneity of environmental conditions is modified by global change."	30	1	0	0	26	0	34	2018-10-01	WOS:000450061000001	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Successional responses in anthropogenic ecosystems have been shown to differ from those in natural ecosystems because of the legacy of continuous management activities. However, few studies have focused on successional changes in anthropogenic freshwater ecosystems following abandonment. Focusing on two drivers (water depletion and cessation of anthropogenic disturbance), we tested whether water depletion plays a larger role than years since abandonment in determining the both plant functional diversity and composition in farm ponds.LocationAwaji Island, western Japan.MethodsWe investigated flora at 200 farm ponds, which had experienced long-term continuous anthropogenic disturbance. We interviewed 100 managers of the surveyed ponds and local farmers to identify the ponds' management status. To capture community processes during succession, we focused on functional richness and functional trait composition. We assessed the relative contribution of the two successional drivers in determining functional richness by adopting a linear model. We classified the survey ponds into five groups based on the two successional drivers and performed PERMANOVA to test differences in functional composition among the groups.ResultsWater depletion played a larger role than elapsed time since cessation of anthropogenic disturbance in determining functional richness. Functional composition of water-depleted ponds significantly differed from that of managed ponds, regardless of years since abandonment.ConclusionsOur results indicate that water depletion has a larger effect on successional changes in ponds than cessation of anthropogenic disturbance; that is, water depletion drives succession and overrides the legacy of continuous anthropogenic disturbance. The results suggest that, in freshwater ecosystems, the functional change in a community is greater in the transition from macrophytes to terrestrial plants than it is in the transition from stress-tolerant species to competitive species."	7	0	0	0	7	0	7	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Focusing on Tibetan grasslands, which are of global ecological importance and exhibit broad climatic and elevational gradients, we asked whether grazing effects are pronounced in humid regions, while climate controls are overriding grazing effects in semi-arid regions.LocationTwenty-eight sites across Tibetan pastures, China; 2820-5150m a.s.l.MethodsWe used multivariate analyses and generalized linear mixed models to examine the effects of livestock activity (hotspots with excessive trampling and nutrient input, heavy, moderate and light grazing), habitat (meadow, steppe, steppe-meadow) and their interactions. We focused on plant species composition, richness and concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), total N and other plant-available nutrients in soils. Major environmental factors were precipitation, temperature and elevation. Plant indicator species sensitive to trampling and/or grazing were identified.ResultsLivestock grazing changed plant species composition and overall soil fertility across habitats. However, effects were only pronounced in hotspots directly adjacent to herder camps, while differences between grazing intensity levels were weak. Heavy grazing favoured annual species, reduced concentrations of SOC and total N in meadows. The environmental factors that control plant communities and soil condition varied among habitats. Plants and soils were more tightly linked in steppes and steppe-meadows than in meadows.ConclusionsSeveral plant species were identified as frequently and reliably present in hotspots of livestock activity, thus are indicative of intensive trampling and excess plant available nutrient inputs. Overall, plant species composition and soil condition across Tibetan pastures were weakly affected by intensified grazing alone compared to that shaped by environmental factors. This clearly refutes the broadly held perception that increased grazing intensity leads to grassland degradation. Such differing and strong abiotic impacts should be considered in future grassland management and conservation."	57	5	0	0	44	2	63	2017-07-01	WOS:000403676000003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Are there temporal patterns in fire and gap dynamics over the last ca. 300yrs? How is drought related to fire occurrence? Are there temporal interactions between gap dynamics and fire?LocationLilley Cornett Woods Appalachian Research Station, Southeastern Kentucky, USA. LCW; 37 degrees 05 ' N, 83 degrees 00 ' W.MethodsWe cross-dated and analysed annually-resolved tree-ring data from 35 tree cross-sections in an old-growth deciduous forest to reconstruct historical fire and canopy disturbance and explore connections among these processes. Canopy disturbance patterns as indicated by tree growth release within this collection [fire history collection: (FHC)] were compared to cores from 26 trees collected in 1983 for the purposes of climate reconstruction [climate collection: (CC)].ResultsInitiation dates in the FHC ranged from ca. 1670 to 1925. Thirty-three fire scars were identified from 1678 to 1956. The mean interval between fire events was 9.3yrs, and there were many more fires after 1800 than before that date. Gap dynamics, as reconstructed through growth release detection, were relatively constant through the FHC record and were supported by a similar result in the CC. The mean number of years between detected release events was 5.2yrs. Many individual trees, and the mean growth chronology for the FHC, indicate that many oak trees exhibit growth release after long periods of suppression and, after a final release, exhibit a step-change in growth rate suggesting canopy accession.ConclusionsFire and gap dynamics occurred through much of the last ca. 350yrs in this old-growth forest. There was not evidence to support that these two processes were temporally linked - gap dynamics were ostensibly independent of fire occurrence. Even so, we posit that these two processes may have a synergistic effect on long-term dynamics, wherein fire 'filters' the seedling pool and gap openings provide canopy accession opportunities. We also note several instances where release events are associated with stand-wide growth increases suggesting large-scale canopy accession. These events could influence the overstorey composition of the forest for centuries."	26	0	0	0	24	0	32	2014-04-01	WOS:000332774800012	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Can a multi-trait plant functional group (PFG) approach extract indicator species more effectively than a single-trait approach? Location Semi-natural and artificial grasslands in the northern and eastern parts of the somma of Mt. Aso, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. Methods We analysed a data set from 203 semi-natural and artificial grassland vegetation plots (each 1 m x 1 m), and compared species and functional compositions among the management types and between the northern and eastern locations using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Potential indicator species were extracted by indicator species analysis (INSPAN) and compared with the results of single-trait and multi-trait PFG approaches, which classify plant species into groups based on individual or combinations of traits (growth form, life span, dispersal mode, flowering season and plant height). Results Only the multi-trait PFG approach successfully clustered the vegetation plots for each management type. Semi-natural burned-and-grazed grasslands in the eastern and northern regions were characterized by a specific PFG among 21 PFGs, whereas the same three PFGs characterized the burned-and-mowed semi-natural grassland of the two regions. The extracted PFGs represent combinations of vegetative, dispersal and reproductive traits (e.g. short, wind- and animal-dispersed species for grazed semi-natural grasslands; tall, summer-flowering forbs for mowed semi-natural grasslands). As compared to indicator species extracted by the multi-trait PFG approach, INSPAN extracted additional indicator species, but some of these were inappropriate. Conclusions We identified PFGs representing each management type and characterized species adaptations to different disturbance regimes, such as mowing and grazing. Among the species extracted by INSPAN, only those classified into the representative PFGs can serve as indicators for characterizing managed semi-natural grasslands. Our findings indicate that using a multi-trait PFG approach can provide reasonable plant indicators for monitoring grassland communities throughout the regions when combined with a species-based INSPAN approach. This proposed method would contribute to the conservation of plant biodiversity in threatened semi-natural grazed and mowed grasslands."	11	0	0	0	12	0	12	2013-01-01	WOS:000312159400011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Location Woodlands in the Central Monte Desert biome of Argentina, Nacunan Man and the Biosphere Reserve area (34 degrees 20' S, 67 degrees 58' W) and surrounding cattle-grazed ranches. Methods We compared seedling emergence and survival, the spatial distribution of seedlings and saplings, and the population stage-based structure of P. flexuosa between paired sites inside and outside the Reserve of Nacunan (Argentina), which has been fenced to exclude domestic cattle for ca. 40 yr. Results Reserve sites had lower tree recruitment and seedling emergence, in spite of having greater seed production and seedling survival. Outside the reserve, survival was higher for seedlings in high-density clumps than for isolated seedlings. Seedling clumps occurred mostly near adult individuals, where cattle dung was abundant, suggesting an effect of cattle on seed dispersal. The balance between the effects of cattle exclusion on seedling emergence and on seedling survival was reflected in the stage structure of P. flexuosa woodlands, as populations at fenced sites were dominated by adult individuals, whereas those at cattle-grazed areas presented greater proportions of seedlings and saplings. Conclusion Fencing is a common practice used worldwide to exclude conservation areas from human disturbance. For example, it is assumed that disturbed woodlands may recover after fencing, thanks to increased tree recruitment after the exclusion of large herbivores. However, the actual effectiveness of fencing as a tool for forest conservation in overgrazed environments could be controversial because sequential effects of herbivores during the tree regeneration cycle may hamper predictions of the overall balance of the recruitment process. Our results suggest that dispersal by cattle influences the regeneration of P. flexuosa woodlands, and that the positive effects of cattle on seedling emergence compensate for the negative effects on seed production and seedling and sapling survival. Future management of P. flexuosa woodlands in the Central Monte Desert should consider that tree recruitment is closely related to land use, and that cattle exclusion does not necessarily guarantee woodland recovery in the long term."	19	1	0	0	21	0	23	2012-08-01	WOS:000305936800002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

What factors influence the effectiveness of exclosures to restore degraded native vegetation in Tigray, Ethiopia?Location: Northern Ethiopia.Methods: We used a space-for-time substitution approach to detect changes in plant species richness, diversity and above-ground standing biomass after conversion of communal grazing lands to exclosures. We selected replicated (n = 3) 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year-old exclosures and paired each exclosure with an adjacent communal grazing land to ensure that soil and terrain conditions were as similar as possible among each pair.Results: All exclosures displayed higher plant species richness, diversity and biomass than the communal grazing lands. Differences in plant species richness and biomass between an exclosure age and adjacent communal grazing land were higher in oldest than in youngest exclosures. In exclosures, much of the variability in plant species composition and biomass was explained by a combination of edaphic (total nitrogen, phosphorus, texture and soil pH) and site (precipitation and altitude) variables (R-2 = 0.72-0.82). Edaphic and site variables also explained much of the variability in plant species composition in communal grazing lands (R-2 = 0.76-0.82). Our study shows that all exclosures are at an early stage of succession. The increase in economically important indigenous shrub and tree species with exclosure age suggests that, with time, a valuable afromontane forest may develop.Conclusions: Establishment of exclosures on communal grazing lands is a viable option to restore degraded native vegetation. However, before expanding exclosures, the ecological consequences of additional exclosures should be investigated as further expansion of exclosures could increase grazing pressure on remaining grazing areas. Furthermore, consideration of edaphic and site variables will help optimize selection of areas for establishment of exclosures and enhance natural regeneration in exclosures in the future."	45	3	0	0	34	0	50	2012-02-01	WOS:000299207600008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The study was conducted over 3 yr. In each successional stage, six paired 4 m(2)-monitoring plots of permanently grazed versus ungrazed plots were arranged in three random blocks. Removal of grazing was introduced de novo for the study. In each plot, percentage cover of each plant and lichen species and total cover of woody plants was recorded.Results: Wild ungulates considerably affected successional pathways and species composition in open habitats but this influence became evident in alteration of abundances of only a few species. Grazing effects differed considerably between successional stages: species richness was higher in grazed versus ungrazed ruderal and pioneer forest plots, but not in the Corynephorus sites. Herbivory affected woody plant cover only in the Pioneer forest sites.

DCAs were performed and total number of species, extinction-colonization rates, species frequency changes and mean Ellenberg indicator values for light, moisture and nitrogen and Eklund indicator values for dependence of human cultural influence were obtained for each island and releve.Results: Species richness has declined on large islands and increased on small islands. The increase in number of species on small islands is driven by a strong increase in frequency of shore species, which in turn is induced by more productive shores. The decrease in species richness on large islands is related to overgrowth of open semi-natural habitats after cessation of grazing and other agricultural practices.Conclusions: After the late 1940s, open habitats, which were created and maintained by cattle grazing and other traditional agricultural activities, have declined in favour of woody shrub and forest land.

How these ecosystems, such as those on semi-arid gypsum outcrops, recover seems a priority for managing change and for ensuring conservation of specialized and endangered biota. We tested whether reinstallation of gypsum vegetation after cropland abandonment requires: (1) soil physical restructuring and (2) chemical readjustment to enable growth and survival of specialized gypsophilous vegetation, and more specifically how time from abandonment drives such environmental change.LocationWe sampled a complete set of old fields on gypsum soils (1-60 yr since abandonment) in Villarrubia de Santiago (Toledo, Spain).MethodsGeneralized linear models and model comparisons were used to analyse the effect of several environmental parameters on species abundance and richness. Ordination methods (canonical correspondence analyses and partial canonical correspondence analyses) were undertaken to evaluate compositional variation among the sampled fields.ResultsSecondary old-field succession on semi-arid Mediterranean gypsum soils was controlled by a complex set of factors acting relatively independently. Surprisingly, time since abandonment explains only a small proportion of compositional variation (3%).

In this comparative study the investigated meadows were either (1) late mown in September; (2) early mown in June or (3) mown in June and then grazed by sheep.Results: The structure of the Surrounding vegetation had a clear effect on the population structure of S. tinctoria.

Generally. we found only slight differences between the population structure of S. tinctoria in early and late mown meadows. Both management regimes had high densities of seedlings. In contrast. the meadow pastures supported significantly lower densities of seedlings and generative adults but relatively high densities of juveniles and vegetative adults. indicating a greater importance of clonal propagation under grazing pressure.Conclusions: Our results clearly showed that viable populations of S. tinctoria may occur in all of the studied management regimes.

The lowland calcareous grasslands of northwestern Europe are highly prized by ecologists and conservationists as a result of the diversity of their plant and invertebrate communities. Large areas of such grasslands have been lost this century as a result of changes in agricultural land use. Recent changes in agricultural policies, in particular the introduction of agri-environmental incentive schemes, have resulted in an increasing area being managed for the restoration of these communities. This paper reviews the management techniques employed in the restoration of lowland calcareous grasslands and the factors that govern their success. Constraints on the enhancement of the plant diversity of restoration sites include high soil fertility and the presence of undesirable species in the soil seed bank. However, it is thought that the primary constraint is the availability of propagules from which new populations can be established. Similarly, the dispersal mode and ability of insect species is likely to be the major factor limiting the enhancement of insect diversity. Evaluation of the success of restoration management usually involves monitoring changes in the plant community. However, as a result of their short life-cycles and sensitivity to small-scale environmental conditions, insects may respond more rapidly to changes resulting from restoration management and therefore provide better indicators of success. With the exception of a few high-profile butterfly species, the use of insects as indicator taxa has largely been neglected in terrestrial systems. This paper illustrates their potential use with reference to lowland calcareous grasslands in southern Britain."	68	1	0	0	55	0	78	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Restoring disturbed lands to their former state is crucial for preserving biodiversity and ecosystem health.

The sites were mostly dominated by non-native species. Plant community composition was not affected by seed mix richness, season, and mowing. Poa pratensis, Taraxacum officinale, Cirsium arvense, and Trifolium pretense were the most dominant species and accounted for 53% of the dissimilarity.Conclusions The presence of seven seeded grass and nine seeded forb species indicates that most seeded species survived, although appropriate management of non-native species is needed for their establishment.

Herbivores often reduce dominant species' abundance (biomass, cover), making resources available for new species and increasing plant diversity. This understanding is crucial in systems undergoing ecological restoration through trophic rewilding. In Iber & aacute; National Park, Argentina, jaguars (Panthera onca) are being reintroduced after a 70-year absence, and it is critical to assess the role of herbivores in shaping plant communities for evaluating future potential trophic cascades. Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the park's most abundant herbivore and an important prey for jaguars, likely exert significant pressure on vegetation. This study aims to investigate how capybara herbivory affects vegetation height, biomass, diversity, and composition, providing insights into how jaguar reintroduction might indirectly influence plant communities and restore ecosystem functionality through capybaras' demographic or behavioral responses. Location Iber & aacute; National Park, Corrientes, Argentina. Methods We simulated the absence of capybara foraging pressure by establishing 10 3 m x 3 m herbivore exclosures with adjacent unfenced control plots in the capybara's grazing lawns. Vegetation attributes-height, biomass, plant diversity, and species composition-were monitored over 4 years to assess the impact of capybara exclusion on plant communities. Results Excluding capybaras significantly increased vegetation height and biomass, which, in turn, altered plant diversity and species composition. The exclosures' vegetation height and biomass were consistently higher than those in control plots. A decrease in species diversity accompanied this shift, as the abundance of common species declined and the dominance of a few species increased, generating new communities. Conclusions Capybaras significantly influence vegetation dynamics, demonstrating their role in shaping plant communities. Excluding capybaras leads to species composition and structural shifts, highlighting herbivory's importance in maintaining ecosystem heterogeneity. These findings provide critical baseline data for understanding the potential indirect impacts of the jaguar's reintroduction on plant communities and ecosystem processes. This study contributes valuable insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying plant-herbivore interactions, which are essential for guiding restoration practices and rewilding strategies."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2025-03-10	WOS:001437036700001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Seed enhancement technologies (SETs) provide a valuable tool for improving plant establishment outcomes for species (such as native grasses) where seed-based approaches are essential to achieve large-scale targets. However, due to the increased investment in resources and time associated with application of SETs, their adoption is dependent on the ability of these treatments to consistently provide benefits to one or more demographic life stages, particularly under field conditions. This meta-analysis addresses the following research question: what are the overall effects of SETs on plant establishment outcomes compared to untreated florets or seeds in native grasses globally?LocationGlobal.MethodsThe effects of six major SET categories (acid treatment, coating, pelleting, flash flaming, priming, and treatment combinations) on germination, emergence, and shoot and root length and biomass were explored. Furthermore, the consistency of the effects of SETs across study types (i.e., laboratory, glasshouse, and field) was investigated.ResultsThe overall effects of SETs on native grasses in this meta-analysis were positive for germination (16% improvement), emergence (22% improvement), and growth (6.42-8.86 cm and 2.26-2.77 g increase in seedling length and biomass, respectively). However, effects ranged from neutral to positive when data were grouped by SET type, with coating, pelleting and priming delivering consistent benefits across multiple life stages, and acid treatments, flash flaming, and combination treatments having mixed effects. This analysis also provided evidence that benefits observed from SET application in laboratory and glasshouse studies are not translating to field environments.ConclusionsOverall, SETs generally had positive effects and can therefore provide a relatively low-risk approach to improving seed-based restoration outcomes in native grasses. Continued SET research focussed on long-term plant establishment outcomes in field environments is needed to further advance SET uptake.Through this meta-analysis, the overall effect of seed enhancement technologies (SETs) on plant establishment outcomes in native grasses compared to untreated florets or seeds was found to be positive. SETs provide a relatively low-risk approach to improving seed-based restoration outcomes in native grasses. Further research focussed on specific SETs, and long-term plant establishment in field environments is needed to advance SET uptake.image"	6	0	0	0	4	0	7	2024-04-14	WOS:001198980100001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We asked whether grasslands dominated by C. epigejos can be restored through mowing and the application of hemiparasitic Rhinanthus alectorolophus. Location: Carpathian Violion caninae alliance mountain grassland close to Vrchslatina, Veporsk & eacute; vrchy Mts, Slovakia. Methods: We conducted a before-after control-impact experiment in a grassland entirely dominated by C. epigejos: six blocks, each with four treatment combinations: (i) mowing once in summer, (ii) mowing in summer and autumn, (iii) mowing in summer and seed sowing of R. alectorolophus, (iv) mowing in summer and autumn along with seed sowing of R. alectorolophus. We monitored the above-ground biomass of C. epigejos, R. alectorolophus, the combined above-ground biomass of other species, and the vegetation composition annually from 2014 to 2017. Linear mixed-effect models and redundancy analysis (RDA) were employed to analyze the effects of the treatments on C. epigejos and community parameters. Results: Sowing established R. alectorolophus at the plots mown twice in the first year, but its density strongly declined in subsequent years. R. alectorolophus and mowing twice significantly reduced C. epigejos biomass and herb layer cover. They also increased community evenness and the ratio between other species and C. epigejos biomass with a more pronounced effect on the plots where R. alectorolophus was applied. Mowing twice led to increased species richness, evenness, the number of target grassland species and their proportion in the community. R. alectorolophus had an additional positive impact on community evenness and the proportion of target species. RDA identified R. alectorolophus as the main driver of the directional community change triggered by the experimental treatments. Conclusion: Mowing twice per season proves to be an efficient restoration management strategy for mountain grasslands dominated by C. epigejos. Sowing R. alectorolophus, however, may be employed as an additional measure to accelerate the decline of C. epigejos at the outset of the restoration process and enhance community structure and composition."	2	0	0	0	1	0	2	2024-05-24	WOS:001224460300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, goals of mitigation measures are often unclear, and the effects on biodiversity of mitigation measures is rarely monitored. We assessed the effects of different revegetation treatments (natural revegetation, seeding, planting) on vegetation development along highways, and on wildlife crossings of different age. Location Highways in southeast Norway. Methods We collected data on vascular plant species, vegetation cover and height, soil grain size and organic matter content, and compared the species composition, richness, and diversity of the restored sites with reference plots in the adjacent target vegetation (mature forest). Results Our results show a significantly higher richness and diversity in restored plots compared to reference plots, and an increased similarity of species composition over time. Species composition was most similar to reference plots in naturally revegetated plots and seeding seemed to reduce both species and functional trait composition similarity. Conclusions It is unrealistic that the defined target vegetation will develop on restored sites. Defining a realistic and achievable target vegetation for each road construction project in relation to land use, adjacent vegetation type and successional stage, as e.g., forest edge instead of forest, would be useful. While this may require more effort for management it will translate to higher mitigation success."	4	0	0	0	4	0	4	2022-07-31	WOS:000829721800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Information on seed persistence in soil is of great importance for fundamental and applied research, yet compiling data sets on this trait still requires enormous efforts. We asked whether the machine-learning (ML) approach could be used to infer and predict SSB properties of a regional flora based on easily available data. Location Eighteen calcareous grasslands located along an elevational gradient of almost 2000 m in the Bavarian Alps, Germany. Methods We compared a commonly used ML model (random forest) with a conventional model (linear regression model) as to their ability to predict SSB presence/absence and density using empirical data on SSB characteristics (environmental, seed traits and phylogenetic predictors). Further, we identified the most important determinants of seed persistence in soil for predicting qualitative and quantitative SSB characteristics using the ML approach. Results We demonstrated that the ML model predicts SSB characteristics significantly better than the linear regression model. A single set of predictors (either environment, or seed traits, or phylogenetic eigenvectors) was sufficient for the ML model to achieve high performance in predicting SSB characteristics. Importantly, we established that a few widely available SSB predictors can achieve high predictive power in the ML approach, suggesting a high flexibility of the developed approach for use in various study systems. Conclusions Our study provides a novel methodological approach that combines empirical knowledge on the determinants of SSB characteristics with a modern, flexible statistical approach based on ML. It clearly demonstrates that ML can be developed into a key tool to facilitate labor-intensive, costly and time-consuming functional trait research."	11	0	0	0	8	0	12	2022-05-19	WOS:000793805800001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We studied the spatial and temporal variations of RUE of the herbaceous layer (RUEH) in woodlands and shrublands and its association with grazing regime, environmental, and vegetation variables. Location We worked in the Arid Chaco (Argentina), an ecotone region between the Chaco and Monte phytogeographic provinces. Woody and herbaceous species coexist in variable proportions in relation to a regional precipitation gradient and local edaphic variations. Methods and results Over eight growing seasons, we estimated RUEH at 12 sites, each with two contrasting grazing regimes (moderate and severe). To do this, we related estimated ANPP(H) from biomass harvests and APAR(H) (absorbed photosynthetically active radiation of the herbaceous layer) calculated from the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then we linked the RUEH with precipitation, physiognomy, soil, and landscape data. Most of the spatial variability of RUEH was accounted for by the grazing regime. Moderately grazed areas had a three times greater RUEH than severely grazed ones (0.507 and 0.180 g MJ(-1) respectively). They also exhibited different proportions of herbaceous functional types. Physiognomic characteristics of the woody layer explained a significant proportion of the spatial variation of RUEH not explained by grazing regime. RUEH was between 30 and 150% greater in woodlands than in shrublands depending on whether the sites were under moderate or severe grazing respectively. Conclusion Grazing regime and woody physiognomy accounted for most of the variation in herbaceous radiation use efficiency. Our results show that RUEH may be predicted with greater accuracy from a combination of vegetation maps and information on grazing regime. Thus, our models could be incorporated into web platforms that provide ANPP(H) (forage) monitoring services based on satellite data, in order to improve their estimates in woodlands, shrublands and savanna ecosystems."	5	0	0	0	2	0	5	2022-04-02	WOS:000772532800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

There have been major declines in its condition and extent. How has moorland composition changed within Scotland over the past ca. 35 yr and what is the role of climate change, pollution and grazing in driving these changes? Location: Five hundred and forty locations across Scotland, UK. Methods: We used a long-term resurvey approach to assess change across Scottishmoorlands. We relocated plots sampled ca. 35 yr previously in alpine heath, dry heath, wet heath and bog, and recorded vegetation species composition. We assessed change in species group richness and cover and mean Ellenberg values between surveys, using paired t-tests. We used CCA with variation partitioning and regression analysis to analyse the vegetation data with spatial data sets on climate, pollution and grazing, to assess the role of each driver in driving vegetation changes. Results: Significant diversity and compositional changes between surveys were found for all habitat types, particularly alpine heath. Significant associations were found with climate (many variables), pollution (N and S) and herbivore number (primarily deer). Species richness generally increased, but several specialist species declined in cover, especially those associated with higher altitude habitats (e. g. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Salix herbacea and alpine lichens). Many of the most successful species are ubiquitous, e. g. the widespread grazing-and pollution-tolerant graminoids Anthoxanthum odoratum, Juncus squarrosus, Festuca rubra and Nardus stricta and the generalist mosses Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and Hylocomium splendens. Conclusions: Diversity and composition of moorlands in Scotland have changed significantly over the ca. 35-yr period studied; the drivers of these changes are complex, with climate, pollution and grazing playing variable roles across habitats. The reduction in specialist species, homogenization of alpine heaths and declines in forb and lichen cover all represent negative changes in the biodiversity value of Scottishmoorlands."	35	1	0	0	30	0	38	2017-04-01	WOS:000398083700005	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Our hypothesis was according to the general paradigm that suppression of natural disturbance regimes and lack of active management causes protected forest areas (PFAs) to develop into forests of high density dominated by late successional tree species.Location: Boreal and hemiboreal forests of Sweden.Methods: We used long-term (60 yrs) data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI), representing all the PFAs in Sweden, to study changes in tree species composition in relation to site factors and the initial state of the forest.Results: During the period of our study the average density expressed by the growing stock (GS) increased from 70 to 140 m(3).ha(-1). This increase concerned both early and late successional tree species and there was no evidence for a faster increase of the late successional species Norway spruce (Picea abies) and the species composition was stable over time. A net volume increment (NVINCR) in spruce was mostly related to sites where spruce already was present, sites with high productivity and forest of high age. The probability of an increase in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) was negatively linked to productivity and stand age, while the NVINCR was higher on more productive sites. The NVINCR of deciduous trees was unrelated to site productivity and age but positively affected by the initial GS, increasing slope and soil depth.Conclusions: Our results suggest that the relative composition of species is stable over time and balanced by site productivity, which is in accordance with the resource-ratio hypothesis. An important cause of this stability could be the low number of tree species in northern Europe, which limits the number of potential successional pathways."	10	0	0	0	7	0	10	2016-07-01	WOS:000384751300002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Existing releves of salt-marsh vegetation (N=6198) made along the entire Dutch Wadden Sea coast (both the mainland and the barrier islands) were used as a reference. The vegetation of the two restored sites (Grie NLR data) was compared with the reference by (1) simple species-by-species analysis based on frequencies in both data sets, and by (2) ordination, where releves of the restored sites were projected into a multivariate space defined by the species' abundances in the reference releves.ResultsOut of the 37 species that are common (i.e. have a frequency >5%) in either the Grie NLR data or the reference data, 31 have frequencies that differ by less than a factor of five, and 23 differ by less than a factor of two. Furthermore, the Grie NLR data occupy a space that is well in the centre of the ordination space defined by the reference data.ConclusionsThere are no conspicuous differences between salt-marsh vegetation behind low dams and the vegetation that has naturally developed on unprotected mudflats.

How representative is the soil seed bank of the extant vegetation at the source site? What influence does the transfer process have on germinant density, species and plant functional type composition? Does smoke and heat treatment of transferred topsoil enhance germination and potential for restoration success?LocationBanksia woodland of the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia.MethodsTo assess the efficacy of topsoil transfer for return of native plant species, we measured topsoil seed bank characterisitcs in situ proir to vegetation clearing, and immediately after transfer of the topsoil to an adjacent, degraded mediterranean-type woodland in southwest Australia. Glasshouse germination of topsoil samples from 24 pre- and 24 post-transfer plots was used to quantify the effects of transfer and soil depth on germinant density, species richness, plant functional types and seed bank similarity to in situ vegetation. Application of germination cues (heat+smoke) was used to explore the impact of topsoil transfer on seed germination and emergence.ResultsTopsoil transfer significantly reduced germinant densities (pre-transfer 1692-4239germinantsm(-2), post-transfer 795-1016germinantsm(-2); t=6.7, P<0.001) and shifted community structure (MRPP: A=0.13, P<0.001), including a reduction of woody species density by 81%. For the majority of functional types, heat and smoke failed to stimulate additional germination post-transfer, suggesting soil transfer simulated the effect of fire-related germination cues.ConclusionAlthough topsoil transfer translocated many viable native seeds, potential restoration success was hindered by reduced germinant densities. This was mostly attributable to a dilution effect associated with mixing of transferred topsoil, so that many seeds were buried too deep to emerge. However, total reductions were greater than expected based on dilution alone, suggesting some seed mortality during the transfer process. Transfer shifted composition towards dominance by annual species, suggesting the need for topsoil transfer to be supplemented by other restoration techniques."	35	2	0	0	29	1	39	2015-07-01	WOS:000356007400004	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

(4) Are edge effects evident in seed bank composition? (5) What is the influence of a suite of abiotic and biotic variables, including deer browse, on seed bank richness and abundance?Location: A 413-ha suburban forest near Baltimore, Maryland, USA.Methods: We sampled the seed bank and vegetation of 100 permanent plots in a Liriodendron-Fagus-Acer-Quercus dominated secondary successional forest. Information on soil chemistry, canopy cover, leaf litter cover and depth, deer browse severity and distance to the nearest urban edge and path was also collected for each plot. Seedling emergence was monitored in a greenhouse over 2yr.Results: A total of 76 species emerged from the seed bank, including 16 woody species and 22 exotic species. Compositional similarity between the seed bank and vegetation was low. Woody species were under-represented and exotic species were over-represented, with exotic species found in the seed bank of 94 of 100 plots. Species composition and exotic species richness and abundance were similar between edge or path and interior plots. Leaf litter cover, vegetation cover, browse severity and variables related to soil fertility were included in top models explaining patterns in seed bank richness and abundance.Conclusions: Reliance on the soil seed bank as a passive restoration strategy will be insufficient for restoring a mature secondary successional suburban forest community. However, a suite of shade-tolerant exotic shrubs and vines that are of concern to management do not appear to use the seed bank, indicating that targeted removal of these species may be successful. Increased deer browse was associated with decreased seed bank abundance and richness, suggesting that deer may directly reduce inputs to the seed bank. If deer are impacting seed bank composition, active restoration will need to include understorey herbs in addition to overstorey species."	20	0	0	0	18	0	27	2013-10-01	WOS:000324090800004	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Methods In a species-rich meadow, seedlings (non-graminoids only) were identified to species and counted in an experiment that included management cessation and five mowing regimes in three types of vegetation for 2yr. The abundance-weighted averages of functional traits were compared between seedling and adult plant communities. Results Seedling occurrence was suppressed by management cessation (abandonment) but differences among the five mowing treatments were small for all vegetation types. Seedling density and species richness were highest in vegetation dominated by Bromus erectus, intermediate in vegetation dominated by Molinia arundinacea, and lowest in vegetation dominated by Calamagrostis epigejos. Comparison of functional trait composition of seedlings with that of adult plants revealed that seedlings were largely produced by species with no or limited clonal growth and with low stature, and therefore with lower competitive ability. Conclusions The results indicate that short-term alteration of the mowing regime does not change conditions conducive to seedling occurrence, but even short-term abandonment hinders the establishment of small, non-clonal species. Rapid changes in species composition after abandonment in temperate meadows are therefore due not only to competitive exclusion of subordinate plant species, but also to their inability to establish from seeds."	21	0	0	0	21	0	21	2013-04-03	WOS:000315690500013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Particularly in protected areas where such conflict of interest exists, the question is asked: what are the ecological thresholds within which fire should be managed? Location Montane proteoid fynbos shrublands, eastern coastal part of the Cape Floral Kingdom; coastal slopes of the Tsitsikamma and Outeniqua Mountains, South Africa. Methods Estimates of optimal fire frequencies are often based on the relationship between plant age and the rate of seed accumulation of the slowest-maturing species. We established juvenile periods and recruitment success (measured as the ratio of post-fire recruits to the pre-burn population) after fires at different intervals, of serotinous, reseeding shrubs in the Proteaceae. From this we estimated minimum fire return intervals (FRIs) that would allow for their persistence in eastern coastal fynbos shrublands. Results Juvenile periods ranged from 4 to 9 yr, which are comparable to ecologically similar proteoids elsewhere in fynbos and SE and SW Australian shrublands. There was large variability among sites and within species in the degree of flowering at given plant ages, some of which seemed related to the moisture regime. There were no consistent differences among species in their rate of maturation. Post-fire recruitment success was near zero following a fire in 5-yr-old vegetation, always above replacement levels following fires in =7-yr-old vegetation, and at a maximum in old (38 yr) fynbos. There was considerable variation in post-fire recruitment success for any particular FRI, species or site. The lack of a significant relationship between recruitment success and pre-fire vegetation age, suggests that once a critical post-fire age is attained, factors other than seed abundance affect recruitment success. Conclusions From an ecological perspective, our findings imply a minimum FRI of 9 yr for eastern coastal fynbos. This is not intended to prescribe rigid management of fire according to a fixed rotation and does not negate the need to consider site- or species-specific requirements. Instead it provides a lower threshold for a range of acceptable FRIs below which a significant decline of species populations is predicted."	37	0	0	0	36	1	39	2013-01-01	WOS:000312159400010	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

At what ages do epiphytic species, and species of conservation concern in particular, occur along a chronosequence of beech?Location: South-west Sweden.Method: Five hundred and seventy-one age-determined trees from 37 plots distributed among 29 beech-dominated stands were Surveyed along with a number of environmental (16) and substrate (seven) variables in a landscape of ca. 550ha. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and indicator species analysis (ISA) were used for data analysis.Results: Plots containing old trees, confined to the base of slopes and with low impacts of recent forestry (thinning), generally had a high richness of species of conservation concern. Richness of common species and red-listed bryophytes were mostly related to the surveyed bark area. At tree level, primary factors explaining both species richness and composition were age, diameter at breast height and moss cover. There was a gradual replacement of tree age ranges for 58 lichens and 37 bryophytes along the chronosequence of beech. Red-listed lichens favoured damaged beech trees ( >= 180 years), whereas red-listed bryophytes were found on old and young steins in dense stands.Conclusions: Tree age exerts a profound influence on epiphytic lichens and bryophytes growing on beech. Many of the habitat specialists were found mainly on old beech because they inhabit specific substrates that occur on older trees. The association to high tree age commonly excludes red-listed lichens from conventionally managed beech forests with a 100- to 140-year rotation period."	132	1	0	0	120	1	142	2009-02-01	WOS:000265846400010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Long-term effects of drainage and initial effects of hydrological restoration on rich fen vegetation	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	11	1	NA	NA	99	106	NA	10.1111/j.1654-109X.2008.tb00208.x	Article	FEB 2008	2008	"Questions: What vegetational changes does a boreal rich fen (alkaline fen) undergo during a time period of 24 years after drainage? How is plant species richness affected, and what are the changes in composition of ecological groups of species? Is it possible to recover parts of the original flora by rewetting the rich fen? Which are the initial vegetation changes in the flora after rewetting? What are the major challenges for restoration of rich fen flora after rewetting?Location: Eastern central Sweden, southern boreal vegetational zone. Previously rich fen site, drained for forestry purposes during 1978-1979. The site was hydrologically restored (rewetted) in 2002.Method: Annual vegetation survey in permanent plots during a period of 28 years.Results: There were three successional stages in the vegetational changes. In the first stage there was a rapid (< 5 years) loss of rich fen bryophytes. The second step was an increase of sedges and early successional bryophytes, which was followed by an increase of a few emerging dominants, such as Molinia caerulea, Betula pubescens and Sphagnum spp. After rewetting, there are indications of vegetation recovery, albeit at slow rates. Depending on, for instance, initial species composition different routes of vegetation change were observed in the flora after drainage, although after 24 years, species composition became more homogenous and dominated by a few species with high cover.Conclusion: Major changes have occurred after changes in the hydrology (drainage and rewetting) with a severe impact on the biodiversity among vascular plants and bryophytes. Several rich fen bryophytes respond quickly to the changes in water level (in contrast to vascular plants). The recovery after rewetting towards the original rich fen vegetation is slow, as delayed by substrate degradation, dispersal limitation and presence of dominant species."	91	3	0	0	86	0	106	2008-02-01	WOS:000252958300011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Actual ground data were subsequently compared against modelled values for each community type and strata derived from the analysis of airborne LiDAR data obtained in 2000.Results: LiDAR data were effective for quantifying vegetation height, cover and density of the overstory within closed- and open Populus forest communities. However, LiDAR measurements typically underestimated the height and cover of shrublands, as well as most of the herbaceous communities. Analysis of LiDAR intensity data indicated reflectance generally decreased as LiDAR sampling points moved upwards from the ground to the vegetation canopy.Conclusions: While LiDAR technology is useful for characterizing deciduous forest properties, the quanti. cation of understory vegetation characteristics, as well as those of individual shrublands and grasslands, was more limiting.

Productivity was measured by means of weighed above-ground phytomass for fine scale and colour-infrared (CIR) aerial photographs of the same system for fine and broad scales. For both scales, total numbers of vascular plant species and numbers of endangered vascular plant species were extracted from current vegetation releves. Additionally, we obtained data on livestock diet (grazed phytomass, crude protein content).Results: Statistical analyses show an influence of the year on all variables; relationships between variables are not significant in ever), year. Species richness and number of endangered species are negatively related to productivity at fine scale while crude protein content and grazed phytomass are positively related to productivity. At the broad scale the diversity-productivity relationship shows a 'hump' with highest species numbers in middle pioneer stages: numbers of endangered species are highest in all pioneer stages.Conclusions: We found a strong impact of scale and year on the diversity-productivity relationship. It is inappropriate to analyse only small plots (2 m(2)). and it is necessary to study different years.

I studied regeneration and the influence of different management practices (removal of topsoil and mowing in late summer). Changes in species composition and cover were followed on permanent plots of 2m x 2m size through five years of vegetation development. At the outset of the experiment the abandoned fields were dominated by dense Urtica dioicalElymus repens stands. Species richness was 7 species/4m(2), and it remained low on unmanaged plots during the time of observation (7.6 species/plot in year 5). Removal of 20 cm of top soil caused a severe decline of Urtica and a large increase in species richness (21 species in year 1 after disturbance). Mowing was slightly higher compared with unmown plots on both initially excavated and unexcavated plots. Total cover was always near 100% (except immediately after top soil removal), Colonization of bare soil was very rapid and in late summer of the first year after disturbance cover already increased towards 100%. On all plots the vegetation was mostly dominated by perennial herbs and grasses. Winter season gaps are occupied by Galium aparine, a large-seeded annual scrambling climber. Monocarpic perennials behaved as winter annuals in most cases. Woody,species were inhibited by dense above-ground biomass and litter cover.

However, for subtropical grasslands in southern Brazil, the interactive effects of fire and grazing on plant community composition characteristics remain relatively understudied, even though this ecosystem is recognized as fire-dependent with critical importance for livestock grazing.LocationSubtropical grassland in southern Brazil (Santiago, Rio Grande do Sul state).MethodsBeginning in 2017, we established an experiment with three treatments: fire only (F), grazing only (G), and fire and grazing (F + G). Grazing was continuous with ca 1.1 animal unit per hectare annually and prescribed fires were applied annually in winter. We assessed vegetation structure (via percentage of bare soil, height of canopy, and available forage) and plant species composition during spring (November) and summer (March) of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (only summer season).ResultsDifferences in vegetation structure were found among treatments, wherein bare soil, height of canopy and available forage were higher in F, and lower but similar in F + G and G. Plant species richness was equal among treatments, but cover of C3 grasses was higher in F than in other treatments, and shrub cover was lower in F and F + G in comparison to G. In F + G treatment, available biomass for subsequent burning was limited, resulting in lower amounts of fuel, reduced fire spread, and ultimately less total area burned in the subsequent years.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that interaction of fire and grazing can be a useful vegetation management tool for conserving native plant species, increasing availability of more desirable forage plants, and decreasing shrubs (including toxic Senecio species which contain hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids).

Research on vegetation responses to the land application of biosolids has increased in the past 20 years, but there is no consensus on how plant communities respond to biosolids applications. What factors influence productivity and vegetative cover following biosolids application for grassland reclamation? How does the addition of biosolids impact plant community responses?Location Global, but predominantly North America and Europe.Methods To explore vegetative responses following biosolids application, we used a global systematic review and meta-analysis of 59 articles. Our meta-analysis used the log response ratio (LRR) as an effect size for productivity, total cover, species richness, diversity and exotic species abundance and explored covariates addressing various site characteristics and reclamation strategies.Results We found that across sites, the land application of biosolids significantly increased productivity and cover but had no significant overall effect on species richness, Shannon diversity or exotic species abundance on degraded lands. These increases in the LRR for productivity and vegetative cover were lower on sites that experienced a fire prior to biosolids application. Climatic variables like mean annual temperature were shown to alter the response of vegetative cover, where warmer sites tended to have more positive responses to biosolids. Seeding was found to increase plant cover but decrease species richness early in the reclamation process.Conclusions This area of research is growing; most of the publications we used come from the last 20 years and were mostly conducted in North America and Europe. While we can build on the present literature, there is clearly room for more research to ensure the process of reclaiming degraded ecosystems using biosolids results in desired plant communities, e.g. high native species diversity.

We assessed changes in plant species richness and composition in burnt and unburnt grassland and juniper plots for 11 years following the wildfire. Yearly vegetation sampling was performed in permanent quadrats of 1 m(2) and 25 m(2) using visual cover estimation. Temporal changes in juniper cover and species richness were evaluated with generalized linear mixed-effects models. Compositional changes were analysed by non-metric multidimensional scaling and fidelity analysis.Results At the beginning of the study, the presence of individual juniper shrubs increased species richness, and did not alter species composition. However, microsites covered by junipers were extremely species-poor. Juniper growth during the study period caused a sharp decline in species richness at the edge of juniper shrubs and a shift in species composition compared to grassland plots. Wildfire increased species richness both in grassland and juniper plots. It caused only transient compositional responses in grasslands, but converted juniper habitats back to the grassland state.Conclusions We conclude that neither moderate juniper encroachment nor wildfire have negative effects on plant species richness in the studied ecosystem.

Predicting natural regeneration, however, depends on the mechanistic understanding of ecosystem resilience. Here, we searched for the factors modulating plant communities spontaneously regenerating in abandoned pastures. Location Tropical savanna (cerrado), Brazil. Methods Over two years, we quantified changes in the structure, richness and species composition of plant communities in 29 secondary savannas resulting from pasture abandonment. We then investigated the influence of soil and landscape attributes, exotic grass cover and time since pasture abandonment on the recovery rate and species composition of these communities. Results The wide variation among sites was not explained by time since abandonment or distance to the nearest remnant native vegetation. Soil attributes, exotic grasses and native vegetation cover around a pasture explained a small fraction of the variation in the recovery rate. We did not find an isolated factor or a robust set of factors explaining the variation in the recovery rate for all vegetation attributes. Species composition was slightly influenced by exotic grasses, soil penetration resistance, proportion of fine soil particles and time since abandonment. Colonization and resprouting by savanna specialists over the two-year period were hindered by exotic grasses. Conclusion The use of predictive models based on soil properties, exotic grasses, landscape attributes or time since abandonment is unfeasible for inferring the recovery rate of savanna structure and richness after pasture abandonment. Case-by-case monitoring is required to support decisions on restoration intervention. Other factors, which are almost impossible to obtain, such as land-use practices and history and the taxonomic or functional composition of pre-existing vegetation, can potentially influence the recovery rate. Exotic grasses must be controlled to favour colonization and resprouting by savanna specialists."	6	0	0	0	4	0	7	2019-10-31	WOS:000491457800001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We asked the following questions: (a) What is the composition of the seed bank and above-ground vegetation? (b) How do they develop over the course of succession within the two different restoration approaches? (c) What is the representation of target and undesirable species in the seed bank and above-ground vegetation? and (d) Could the seed bank serve as the source for target vegetation restoration? Location Trebon Basin, Czech Republic. Methods Three successional stages and two types of restoration approaches were considered. Bray-Curtis similarity was used for describing the similarity between above-ground vegetation and the seed bank. Representation of target (dry sandy grassland), desirable (woodland, wetland, mesic grassland) and undesirable (synanthropic) species was assessed. Results The type of restoration approach exhibited stronger effects on the above-ground vegetation than on the seed bank. The similarity between the seed bank and above-ground vegetation decreased during succession. Undesirable species formed the dominant species group in the seed bank regardless of successional stage and the type of restoration approach. Target species were represented especially in the above-ground vegetation of young successional stages. Only half of the number of target species appeared in the seed bank in comparison to above-ground vegetation and their number further rapidly decreased in older stages of succession. Conclusions The result showed that the seed bank of sand pits could be considered as a potential resource mainly for synanthropic species, but it cannot serve as the only source for the eventual restoration of the target vegetation of an open sandy dry grassland after potential clearing, once it becomes overgrown by forest. Consequently, maintaining young successional stages is desirable if we wish to support species typical of dry sandy grassland."	8	0	0	0	7	0	8	2019-06-06	WOS:000466383400008	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What is the relationship between soil extractable nitrogen and plant diversity in sandy and infertile soils? How does cattle grazing affect soil extractable nitrogen and how might this indirectly impact plant diversity via the N-plant diversity relationship? Location Grazed coastal grasslands on Naushon Island, off of Cape Cod, MA, USA. Methods We surveyed summer vegetation from 2014 to 2017 and analyzed soils for extractable nitrogen (N) in two grazed grasslands on Naushon Island. We also set up cattle enclosures and exclosures to manipulate grazing pressure and test how cattle grazing influenced plant diversity (species richness and Shannon's diversity) and extractable NH4+ and NO3-. In the enclosure experiment, cattle were enclosed for up to a week in the mid-summer of 2014, 2015, and 2016. For the exclosure experiment, we excluded cattle from areas from 2014 to 2017. Results In both the enclosure and exclosure experiments, higher grazing pressure corresponded to less negative change of plant species richness and Shannon's diversity from 2014 to 2017. Total extractable N had a weak positive correlation with plant diversity, but increasing extractable NO3- correlated with decreasing species richness (p = 0.001) and Shannon's diversity (p = 0.009). Neither the cattle enclosures nor exclosures were related to soil extractable N. Conclusions Cattle grazing may help prevent or slow losses of plant diversity that are occurring in many coastal grasslands, including Naushon Island. This effect does not seem to be regulated by cattle deposition of N in the soil or the N-plant diversity relationship. Our results of the N-plant diversity relationship differ from the mainstream understanding, perhaps due to Naushon's sandy and infertile soils."	7	1	0	0	4	0	8	2019-06-06	WOS:000466383400011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Followed by consequent monitoring of establishment and population dynamics and synthesis of relevant literature resources.ResultsAppropriate timing of seed sowing is needed for successful Rhinanthus introduction. Rhinanthus seeds must be sown at latest in November to break their dormancy (valid for Central European populations; might be different e.g. in oceanic regions). Rhinanthus is able to establish a viable population mainly in low- to moderately-productive grasslands with biomass production below 500g center dot DW center dot m(-2). Its establishment is difficult in grasslands of higher productivity due to the effect of competition for light on the seedlings. Rhinanthus requires grasslands with appropriate management including mowing and removal of litter, if it accumulates. Otherwise, the litter layer strongly suppresses seedling establishment. Litter removal can allow establishment even in some productive communities such as stands of Calamagrostis epigejos. However, early mowing (i.e. mowing conducted before ripening of seeds) can lead to a strong decline or even local eradication of the hemiparasitic annuals. Soil conditions on the site of seed origin and the target site can play an important role, as indicated by failures of establishment of Rhinanthus originating from slightly acidic soils on sites with soil pH values around 8. Suitability of a given site for Rhinanthus introduction can be estimated on the basis of its species composition using the Beals index or less formal expert knowledge of local floristic associations of Rhinanthus spp. In the case of suitable conditions, sowing density of 200-500seeds center dot m(-2) should be sufficient for Rhinanthus establishment.ConclusionMowing or grazing, litter removal, proper timing of sowing, and use of the seeds from local seed sources should considerably increase probability of Rhinanthus successful introduction. However, stochastic events like adverse weather conditions or damage through herbivory make the prediction of introduction success difficult."	27	0	0	0	24	0	28	2014-04-30	WOS:000332774800009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Which factors influenced success? Can success be assessed in prairie restoration using indices of ecological fidelity?LocationNachusa Grasslands in Lee and Ogle Counties, Illinois, USA.MethodsTo assess restoration of ecological fidelity, mean coefficient of conservatism (Mean C), floristic quality index (FQI), above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), soil bulk density, total soil nitrogen (N) and total soil carbon of 19 restoration sites were recorded from 20x50m modified Whittaker plots across a chronosequence, and compared to benchmark values acquired from both the literature and field observation of remnant prairies. Following assessment, multiple factors were examined through correlation analysis, Akaike's information criterion and multiple regression analysis to determine the relationship of these factors to restoration success.ResultsAll restoration sites attained the benchmark value for Mean C, while only four attained the benchmark value for FQI. Mean C and FQI both decreased across the chronosequence. Frequency of prescribed fire and soil bulk density had significant positive relationships to Mean C. FQI was best explained by the FQI value of the seed mix sown. Thirteen restoration sites attained the benchmark value for ANPP, which remained stable across the restoration chronosequence. Abundance of exotic species and soil drainage had a negative relationship to ANPP. Few restoration sites attained benchmark values for soil bulk density, total N and total carbon, and none of the sites showed a trajectory towards benchmark values across the chronosequence.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates that high-quality seed mixes may aid in establishing prairie restorations with high scores of floristic quality. However, restoration of vegetation does not guarantee the successful restoration of ecological function. Long-term monitoring is needed to more effectively assess durability and the multiple factors that influence restoration quality.

Our research addresses the issue of species-specific results by investigating the feasibility of using plant traits instead of taxonomic identity to characterize species responses to restoration treatments. Location Ten bunchgrass prairie sites in the Pacific Northwest of North America (Oregon and zashington, USA; British Columbia, Canada). Methods We developed two types of quantitative models for each of ten prairie restoration sites: (1) plant trait models, which related plant traits to species field responses following restoration management treatments; and (2) species identity models, which related species taxonomic identity to species field responses following restoration management treatments. Species identity models determined the maximum amount of variability of field responses that can be explained by differences in individual species' responses to management treatments. Plant trait models determined what proportion of this explanatory power can be attributed to plant traits. The two model types addressed the following specific questions: (1) how much of the variability in field responses (changes in cover) of plants to restoration management treatments is explained by plant traits; and (2) how well do plant traits explain the variability of field responses (changes in cover) following restoration management treatments compared to models relating field responses to species identity? Results (1) The plant trait models explained much of the variability within each of the ten restoration sites, with R2 values ranging between 31% and 69%. (2) The species identity models explained between 47% and 74% of variability of change in cover (R2). Thus, the plant trait models explained nearly as much variability as the species identity models. In seven out of nine sites, the plant trait models were superior to the species identity models, as measured by AIC, i.e. the trait models did well at explaining variability with less model complexity. Conclusion Strong explanatory power of plant trait models supports the feasibility of using plant traits instead of species taxonomic identity as a common language to characterize plant field responses (changes in cover) to restoration treatments."	27	3	0	0	22	0	39	2012-10-03	WOS:000308373500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In this paper, we examine and compare the performance of six state-of-the-art methods commonly used in ecological modelling: Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).Location: Northern Spain.Methods: We used presence/absence data of 15 plant species of an alpine rangeland in northern Spain and 14 topographical and geomorphological descriptors to build the models. We used leave-one-out cross validation on each model and computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the resolution and calibration diagrams of the resulting probabilistic predictions. We also analysed the binary presence/absence deterministic predictions and computed the corresponding confusion matrices to calculate sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa and the True Skill Statistic (TSS).Results: In general, CART and MAXENT showed poor performance and MLR was competitive with the more sophisticated ANN, MARS and SVM methods. The best predictive resolution was obtained, in most cases, by ANN followed by SVM and CART models; however, MLR and MARS were generally the best calibrated. The MAXENT predictions attained, in general, poor resolution and moderate to good calibration.Conclusion: Assessment of model calibration and resolution, in addition to ROC and confusion matrix-derived indices, is an important step for model choice depending on the final aim. Most of the target species were accurately predicted showing that the variables used are suitable descriptors at the scale of analysis."	38	3	0	0	28	1	46	2011-07-16	WOS:000292339800012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	YES

Generalized linear models were used to examine changes in species richness with increasing time since wildfire and analysis of similarities to examine changes in community composition. Chi-squared tests were conducted to examine the distribution of individual species across four time since fire categories.Results: Plant species relationships to fire varied between the three formations. Shrubby dry SF supported lower plant species richness with increasing time since wildfire and this was associated with shifts in community composition. Grassy dry SF showed significant shifts in community composition and species richness in relation to time, with a peak in plant species richness 20-30 yr post fire (either prescribed fire or wildfire). Wet SF increased in species richness until 10-20 yr post wildfire then displayed a general declining trend. Species richness in each vegetation type was not related to the fire frequencies and fire intervals observed in this study.Conclusions: Long-unburnt (30-50 yr post wildfire) forests appeared to play a minor role in the maintenance of plant species diversity in dry forest systems, although this was more significant in wet forests. Maintenance of a range of fire ages within each vegetation formation will assist in maintaining floristic diversity within regions."	5	0	0	0	5	0	7	2011-03-23	WOS:000287863600003	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Multivariate analyses were used to assess successional trends.Results: The transferred meadow blocks served as a source of diaspores for the seed-limited fallow land. Out of 80 transplanted species 17 species spread to adjacent plots within 3 yr. The frequency of plants expanding from the transferred turfs, either vegetatively or by seeds, was relatively low and from 2002 to 2004 a total of 22 species declined in the transferred turfs before expanding to the neighbourhood. Successional trends in species composition of the plots adjacent to the transferred blocks were strongly significant compared with the vegetation of the source area despite the short-term data used for the evaluation. The role of the seed bank in restoration was negligible.Conclusions: In infertile and dry environments, transplanted turfs may significantly speed up restoration, especially if natural sources of target plant seeds are not available in the neighbourhood.

Time since abandonment, tree cover, soil depth, degree of soil podsol development, size of the infield area and two measures of connectivity were used as predictors for species richness and species composition.ResultsFormer outland had denser tree cover, fewer species and fewer grassland species than former arable fields and hay meadows, irrespective of time since abandonment. Former hay meadows and arable fields with a longer time since abandonment were less rich in species, more wooded and had greater podsolization than meadows and fields abandoned at a later stage. Species richness was higher in hay meadows and arable fields at farms with larger infield area and deeper soils compared with farms with smaller infield area and shallower soils. The greatest richness of species and most open habitat were former arable fields at larger farms abandoned 50 yr before the study. Former arable fields had the highest number of grassland species.ConclusionAfter 50 yr of abandonment, former arable fields were the most important remnant habitats for grassland species and may be a more promising target for restoration than formerly managed grasslands."	10	0	0	0	9	0	10	2010-08-01	WOS:000279438400005	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The experiment was carried out on two types of surrounding vegetation (exotic annual grasses and exotic forbs).Results: Topsoil removal greatly enhanced establishment from seeds and transplant survival, mainly because it reduced the exotic vegetation and thus reduced competition. While removing neighbours was essential when topsoil was left intact, it had a negative effect on N. pulchra when surrounding species included exotic forbs (Brassica spec. and Asteraceae) at low density (after topsoil removal).

We calculated the normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) for winter and summer, as well as the difference between summer and winter NDVI (i.e., summer increment NDVI). A set of approximately 50 forest stands of known age and phenology were used to interpret patterns in winter and summer increment NDVI over successional time, and a continuum was found to exist between pine-dominance and hardwood-dominance. We fitted a series of linear regressions that modeled the change in winter and summer increment NDVI as a function of initial winter and summer increment NDVI. and additional explanatory variables.Results: All regressions were highly significant (P < 0.0001, R-2 = ca. 0.3).

Plant species characteristic of very nutrient-rich herb vegetation disappeared or decreased while the cover and species richness of species from wet, moderately productive habitats increased. Very few new species colonized the floodplain.Conclusion: Nutrient-rich flooding water does not necessarily result in increased abundance of species from nutrient-rich habitats, very likely because N becomes less available by denitrification and is transformed into biomass by tall herbs.

In Louisiana, we applied intensity treatments to quadrats by manipulating ground-cover fuels, just prior to biennial growing season fires. Maximum fire temperatures were measured, and stem densities were censused before and after fires in both regions.Results: After dormant season fires in Florida, stem densities were seven times greater than initial levels for Hypericum spp. In contrast, growing season fires reduced densities of H. brachyphyllum by 65%, but did not change densities of H. microsepalum. Only resprouting of H. microsepalum decreased with increased fire intensity. In Louisiana, fire intensity influenced Ilex vomitoria, but not Quercus spp. Following fires, stem densities of I. vomitoria were five times greater in fuel removal than fuel addition areas.Conclusions: Past use of dormant season fires likely contributed to increased abundances of some species of root-crown bearing shrubs observed today in old-growth savannas. Reintroduction of growing season fires will be effective in maintaining or decreasing stem densities, depending on species and fuel type. Genet mortality and stem density reductions appear most likely in areas at localized scales where tree falls and needle coverage create hotspots in Pinus palustris savannas."	18	0	0	0	16	0	25	2006-05-01	WOS:000242292500005	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To what extent do these different treatments affect productivity and sward structure of an agriculturally improved grassland? Location: A mesic lowland grassland near Gottingen, Lower Saxony. Germany. Methods: Recruitment success of eight sown wildflower species was studied in a permanent grassland treated by a factorial combination of different pre-sowing cutting intervals (1.3 or 9 wk). post-sowing cutting intervals (1, 3 or 9 wk) and disturbance (control. harrowing, removal of sward). Seedling emergence and survival. biomass production and sward structure were followed over two years. Results: For most species seedling emergence was highest in the harrowing treatment. The complete sward removal did not further increase seedling emergence. Seedling survival was strongly influenced by the post-sowing cutting frequency with highest mortality in the 9 wk cutting interval compared to one and 3 wk cutting intervals. Annual dry matter yield varied between 4.4, 5.9 and 9.4 t.ha-1 in the 1, 3 and 9 wk pre-sowing cutting treatment, respectively. In June, when the seeds were sown. the tiller number of the I wk cut plots was twice as high as for the 9 wk cut plots and five times higher than in the harrowing treatment. Conclusions: Disturbance by harrowing provided the optimal environmental cues to trigger germination, whereas seedling survival was facilitated by increased light penetration due to frequent cutting.

Land evaluations are not always conducted with adequate understanding of the relevant geologic and climatic contexts and their appropriate scales. This understanding is essential for developing representative sampling, monitoring, and conservation designs, and for pooling results of landscape analysis. To provide context for several regions of the interior northwestern United States, we conducted an ecoregion classification of the interior Columbia River Basin and vicinity (the Basin). We grouped land units that are influenced by the same higher order geology and landform features, and share similar areal composition of potential vegetation and climate attributes. We used the TWINSPAN procedure to group 7496 watersheds of the Basin into 53 ecological subregions. We evaluated the contribution of attributes to group separation by discriminant analysis, and evaluated subregion robustness to prediction by cross-validation. Classification accuracy ranged from 80-97% across the subregions. All watersheds were classified to a subregion, and there were strong resemblances between members of adjacent subregions. Subregions with strong resemblances shared a similar composition of attributes, but differed in relative abundance and attribute combinations. We evaluated the geologic and climatic context of each subregion considering four levels in a nested land unit hierarchy. Most subregions nested at one of at least four scales, but some overlapped. Our results suggest that observation levels for a given ecological phenomenon need not be nested within their appropriate context levels, and across broad geographic areas context of the same phenomenon occurs at different scales."	29	0	0	0	28	0	42	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Understanding community diversity patterns can help investigate drivers of community assembly and assess restoration success. Do biodiversity patterns differ among grassland communities sown with different ecotypes of dominant species during restoration along a rainfall gradient in the tallgrass prairie of the central US Great Plains?Location: Four field sites across a rainfall gradient within the North American Great Plains: Colby, Kansas (39 degrees 23'17.8?N, 101 degrees 04'57.4?W), Hays, Kansas (38 degrees 51'13.2?N, 99 degrees 19'08.6?W), Manhattan, Kansas (39 degrees 08'22.3?N, 96 degrees 38'23.3?W), and Carbondale, Illinois (IL, 37 degrees 41'47.0?N, 89 degrees 14'19.2?W).Methods: We applied linear mixed models to assess the effect of dominant species ecotype, year, and location on grassland taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity.Results: The non-local grass ecotype (compared to the local ecotype) promoted spe- cies richness. In contrast, the effect of the dominant species ecotype on phylogenetic or functional diversity was site-specific over the 10 -year restoration. Richness decreased across the rainfall gradient from dry to moist sites, and the wettest site had the highest phylogenetic and functional diversity.Conclusions: Our results suggest that abiotic filtering by rainfall is a key assembly mechanism that could predict grassland changes in biodiversity in the early restoration phases. Given the community response across the tallgrass prairie, restoration practitioners should consider the impact of regional sources of dominant species used in restoration when biodiversity is a restoration goal. It is recommended for future grassland restoration to detect gaps and limitations in evolutionary and trait structure that will reveal which diversity components to evaluate."	6	0	0	0	5	0	6	2023-09-25	WOS:000974829700001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What are the impacts of extreme droughts on community composition, diversity, Ellenberg indicator scores and species groups in oligotrophic montane Nardus grasslands, and what are the associated mechanisms of vegetation change?LocationRhon Mountains, Germany.MethodsOver three consecutive years, we investigated the effects of yearly droughts (April-August) in an experimental setup with rainout shelters. Owing to the coincidence of ambient extreme dry conditions in those years and our artificial rainfall reduction, we evaluated the contribution to community change of ambient drought conditions and the treatments. We analysed changes in community composition by applying redundancy analysis to species differences in comparison with the pretreatment year, and used mixed-effects models to test for changes in community-weighted means of Ellenberg indicator scores, sociological and functional groups.ResultsWe found significant changes in species abundance and community structures in response to drought. Evenness increased, but species richness remained rather stable over time. Ellenberg indicator scores for temperature and nitrogen increased, whereas the score for moisture decreased. Simultaneously, dominant species declined and subdominants increased. Changes occurred with a time lag and were driven largely by the high ambient drought level and less by the artificial treatments.ConclusionsOur results show that drought-related changes in community composition in Nardus grasslands occur across community structures, characteristic species, and species groups. The post-drought recovery of the community is shaped by community filters, which in particular allow subdominants to take advantage of newly available niches in the matrix, even if they lack strong drought tolerance. Our findings indicate a certain resilience of the community to droughts related to climate change, which suggests that the observed changes should not lead to an accelerated short-term decline in these grasslands, but that this cannot be excluded in the long term."	6	0	0	0	6	1	6	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800006	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In contrast, road verges hosted more forest species and ruderal species, especially bryophytes. Road verges differed from meadows in their soil conditions. Conclusions We conclude that although road verges may host some species typical to meadows, their value as alternative habitats could be increased by improved soil preparation and vegetation management. Meanwhile, the continued decline of quality habitats for meadow species underscores the need to maintain, increase and improve meadow management."	8	0	0	0	5	0	8	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Biogeographic variability of coastal perennial grasslands at the European scale	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	21	2	NA	NA	312	321	NA	10.1111/avsc.12356	Article	APR 2018	2018	"Question: Coastal environments have often been described as azonal. While this characteristic is clear for the foredune system, it seems less evident for more inland fixed dunes, which host habitats of major conservation concern, whose features seem to be more related to local climatic conditions. We hypothesized that, unlike other coastal habitats, dune perennial grasslands differ floristically and structurally across their European range and that patterns of variation are linked to the corresponding climate.Location: European coasts (Atlantic Ocean, Baltic, Mediterranean, Black Sea).Methods: We used a large data set of phytosociological releves, representative of coastal grasslands throughout their European range. The role of climatic variables (temperature, precipitation and continentality) in determining the variability in species composition and vegetation structure (by means of life forms) was investigated through CCA, DCA and GLM. The degree of concentration of species occurrences within groups was calculated through the Phi coefficient.Results: Through multivariate analyses we identified seven major types of coastal grassland, corresponding to different geographic areas. The groups significantly differed in their climatic envelope, as well as in their species composition and community structure.Conclusion: Our results confirm the hypothesis that coastal dune perennial grasslands are subjected to local climate, which exerts significant effects on both floristic composition and community structure. As a consequence, coastal grasslands are particularly prone to the effect of possible climate change, which may alter species composition and distribution, and lead to shifts in the distribution of native plant communities."	29	0	0	0	30	0	35	2018-04-01	WOS:000430912500015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

These uses impose ecological disturbances affecting forest regeneration potential after field abandonment. Finding ways to identify those agricultural land uses limiting forest regeneration is a critical issue for conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. Here, we developed a fast and inexpensive index, useful for quantifying ecological disturbance regimes associated with agricultural land uses, and tested its power to predict forest regeneration potential.LocationMunicipality of Marques de Comillas, southeast Mexico.MethodsInterviews were conducted with local farmers to quantify disturbance components (size, duration and severity) associated with agricultural land uses. The scaled values of these disturbance components were added in a simple ecological disturbance index (EDI). In each one of nine recently abandoned fields representing a wide range of EDI values, two 10-m(2) plots, one close to and one far from nearby forest remnants, were established. On each plot, all woody plants of 10-100m in height were counted, identified and measured in four 1-m(2) subplots, at the time of field abandonment and 2yr later. In addition, at each plot, 18 site condition (microclimate and soil) attributes were quantified at the time of abandonment. Plant density, biomass, species richness and species diversity were used as regeneration variables, and EDI and site condition attributes as independent ones.ResultsTwo years after abandonment, most regeneration variables declined exponentially with EDI. Biomass was not explained by EDI but changed positively with light availability. EDI was strongly correlated to vapour pressure deficit, which also predicted regeneration potential (except biomass).ConclusionsEDI is a cheap and easy tool for quantifying the ecological disturbance produced by a wide range of agricultural land uses. The index predicted several regeneration variables as well as or better than direct measurements of the site condition at the time of abandonment. EDI can be used to identify biodiversity-friendly agricultural land uses in human-modified landscapes."	62	5	0	0	46	6	67	2015-07-01	WOS:000356007400010	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Using partial volumes to estimate available browse biomass in Southern African semi-arid savannas	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	17	3	NA	NA	578	590	NA	10.1111/avsc.12084	Article	JUL 2014	2014	"Aims: With the increase of game farming in woody areas, as well as the pressing need to assess the spatial distribution of carbon, the quantification of available browse biomass has become an important subject to refine. We aimed to (1) calculate tree canopy volume (CVol) for varying tree canopy shapes and for strata within those shapes to cater for different herbivore browse heights, (2) develop a relation to estimate available browse of deciduous (micro-and mesophyllous) and evergreen (macrophyllous) semi-arid savanna tree species using our calculated CVols, and (3) demonstrate the application of the use of partial volumes and the resultant regression models in the determination of available browse biomass for browsing game species.Location: Four key savanna tree species were sampled in the open wooded grassland areas of three game reserves in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Bonamanzi Game Park, Mun-Ya-Wana Private Game Reserve and Pongola Game Reserve.Methods: Tree CVol determination involved calculation of partial volumes, using the integration of a series of circles, allowing a wider range of tree shapes to be included. Non-linear regression was used to investigate the relation between available browse biomass of deciduous microphyllous Acacia nilotica, evergreen macrophyllous Euclea divinorum and Gymnosporia senegalensis and deciduous mesophyllous Spirostachys africana and their respective calculated partial CVols.Results: Exponential non-linear regression (Y = a + br(ln X)) of the natural logarithm of CVol data provided an accurate and precise description of the tree CVol-available browse biomass relation. Significant relations were obtained over a 2-yr period (2003-2004) for species-site models and general species models. The incorporation of tree foliage densities in available browse biomass estimation further improved model accuracy and precision.Conclusion: The general models provided an objective means of determining the browsing capacity of a tree population. In addition, estimation of carbon sequestration could be related to the model output, particularly when changes over time are recorded. Regular measurement of available browse comprises a useful monitoring tool to evaluate impact of animals on trees and shrubs."	5	0	0	0	5	0	6	2014-07-01	WOS:000337725300019	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Do the floristic differences between Pannonia and the Balkans correspond to the current phytosociological classification? Location Pannonia (Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia, Romania) and the Balkans (Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece). Methods Two thousand four hundred and thirty-seven releves from halophytic and sub-halophytic habitats were classified using a modified TWINSPAN. The crispness of classification was checked. DCA and CCA with climate data as explanatory variables were applied. Results The classification was best interpreted at the level of 15 clusters. The vegetation changed along the salinity gradient from sub-halophytic grasslands (including Trifolion resupinati alliance of the Molinio-Arrhenatheretalia class and Beckmannion eruciformis and Festucion pseudovinae p. p. alliances of the Festuco-Puccinellietea class) and reed beds (Bolboschoenion maritimi p. p. alliance; the Phragmito-Magnocaricetea class), through steppe and wet inland halophytic vegetation (Festucion pseudovinae p. p., Puccinellion limosae, Pucinellion convolutae, Bolboschoenion maritimi p. p. and Juncion gerardii of the Festuco-Puccinellietea class) towards the extreme halophytic vegetation of the Thero-Salicornietea, Crypsietea and Juncetea maritimi classes. This gradient was longer in the Balkan region, where it spanned from the sub-mediterranean salt-rich grasslands to the extremely halophytic vegetation at the Black Sea coast. The second most important gradient coincided with the water regime. Some vegetation types appeared to be confined to either the Pannonian or the Balkan region (especially within dry sub-halophytic and steppe halophytic grasslands), while others were distributed across the entire study area. The above-mentioned pattern did not always correspond with current classification systems. Conclusions Variation in salt-rich vegetation predominantly follows the salinity and water regime gradients. Geographical variation, generally coinciding with climatic and historical effects, is also important, especially in drier salt-rich habitats. Our large-scale analysis of the floristic variation of salt-rich habitats might be useful for the unification of classification systems that differ substantially between the countries involved. In addition, the analysis may be useful for adjustment of a classification system in the poorly explored Balkan region, where particular vegetation types were identified with, or delimited from, Central European vegetation types without detailed comparative analysis until now."	68	0	0	0	66	1	79	2013-07-01	WOS:000319885000018	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We propose a concrete methodology that will highlight the most speciose areas and those areas that are insufficiently sampled. Location Catalonia, covering 31 980 km2 in northeast Spain. Methods This study provides a quantitative assessment of plant richness using sampling units of 10 km x 10 km (n = 319). Generalized linear models (GLM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and a maximum entropy model (Maxent) were used for all plant species contained in the Catalonia Database of Biodiversity (Banc de Dades de Biodiversitat de Catalunya, BDBC). The projected presence/absence maps were combined to create species richness maps based on distribution models for 2738 species. Results The modelling techniques were highly correlated, and we did not distinguish any differences in projections of geographic patterns of species richness among the modelling algorithms. However, MARS and Maxent achieved the best prediction success, whereas GLM tended to over-predict species number per quadrat. The MARS map gave the highest predictive performance based on both Kappa and the true skill statistic, and for the two components of disagreement (quantity and allocation disagreement). We were able to identify one previously known region of high diversity, the Pyrenees, and two additional areas, the coastal range and the pre-coastal mountain range. Conclusions We obtain improved distribution patterns for plant species in Catalonia over the previously sampled patterns, and, most importantly, we provide an estimate of the number of species present in those areas where sampling data are incomplete, with an expected 300 species. The model-predicted richness maps presented here can be used to detect zones with low and high species richness and to develop strategies for either restoring or protecting landscape biodiversity as part of national conservation plans."	11	0	0	0	12	0	14	2012-07-25	WOS:000305936800010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	YES

Can possible changes be attributed to climate change?Location: Ammassalik Island near Tasiilaq, Southeast Greenland.Methods: Species composition and cover of 11 key vegetation types were recorded in 110 vegetation survey plots in 1968-1969 and in 11 permanent plots in 1981. Recording was repeated in 2007. Temporal changes in species composition and cover between the surveys were tested using permutation tests linked with constrained ordinations for vegetation types, and Mann-Whitney tests for individual species. Changes in vegetation were related to climate change.Results: Although climate became warmer over the studied period, most of the vegetation types showed minor changes. The changes were most conspicuous in mire and snowbed vegetation, such as the Carex rariflora mire and Hylocomium splendens snowbed. In the C. rariflora mire, species number and cover of vascular plants and cover of bryophytes increased, whereas in the H. splendens snowbed species numbers of vascular plants, bryophytes, and also lichens increased. Lichen richness increased in the Carex bigelowii snowbed and cover of bryophytes in the Salix herbacea snowbed. No such changes occurred in the Alchemilla glomerulans meadow, Alchemilla alpina snowbed and Phyllodoce coerulea heath. There was no change of species composition within the Salix glauca scrub, A. alpina snowbed, lichen grassland and the Empetrum nigrum and Phyllodoce coerulea heaths. Most changes resulted from increasing frequency or cover of some species; there were very few decreasing species. Most of the increasing species indicate drier substrate conditions.Conclusions: Only minor changes in species composition and cover were detected in the vegetation types studied. These changes were probably caused by milder winters and warmer summers during the years before the 2007 sampling. Climate warming may have reduced the duration of snow cover and soil moisture, particularly in snowbed and mire habitats, where species composition change was most pronounced. However, its magnitude was insufficient to cause a major change in species composition. Thus, on the level of plant community types, tundra vegetation near Tasiilaq was rather stable over the last 40 years."	42	0	0	0	39	0	55	2011-04-01	WOS:000287863600009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Survival was recorded the first growing season after planting, which was a very dry season.Results: Overall, seedling survival ranged from as little as 0% to 24%, and tree shelters consistently enhanced survival in Quercus species only, ranging from 16% in walled shelters to 8% in mesh shelters. Shelters failed to boost survival in the six remaining species.Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that both walled and mesh shelters were mostly ineffective at increasing seedling survival for the Mediterranean species used in this experiment; these species coincide with those used in restoration programs. The use of shelters in restoration programs conducted in arid environments should be reconsidered, while walled shelters might be advisable for Mediterranean Quercus species only.

In both experiments we used nutrient-poor deep-sand substrate (abiotic approach), raked/mown inoculation material from target areas and grazing as management tool (biotic and management approach). The vegetation of the restoration and donor areas was sampled once a year and analysed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination and target-species ratios. Mixed linear models were calculated to determine effects of grazing (experiment 1) and year (both experiments).Results: NMDS revealed a continuous development of the restored sites towards the corresponding donor sites. Similarly, target-species ratios of the restored sites tended towards the ratios of the donor sites. To date, grazing effects have mainly been structural: reduction of a carpet-forming pleurocarpous moss species and of litter. In addition, cover of target species in relation to total plant cover was significantly enhanced by grazing in the last two study years.Conclusions: The combination of nutrient-poor substrate, inoculation with raked/mown plant material and grazing proved to be a very effective restoration method for dry base-rich sand ecosystems.

Biomass allocation and arbuscular mycorrhizal infection were also examined in the two dominant species, Salix rotundifolia and Carex aquatilis.ResultsAbove-ground biomass of graminoids increased in response to warming but there was no difference in total plant biomass or the ratio of above-ground to below-ground biomass for the community as a whole. Carex aquatilis increased above-ground biomass and proportionally allocated more biomass above ground in response to warming. Salix rotundifolia increased the amount of above- and below-ground biomass allocated per leaf in response to warming. Mycorrhizal infection rates showed no direct response to warming, but total abundance was estimated to have likely increased in response to warming owing to increased root biomass of S. rotundifolia.ConclusionsThe community as a whole was resistant to short-term warming and showed no significant changes in above- or below-ground biomass despite significant increases in above-ground biomass of graminoids. However, the patterns of biomass allocation for C. aquatilis and S. rotundifolia did change with warming. This suggests that long-term warming may result in changes in the above-ground to below-ground biomass ratio of the community."	47	7	0	0	38	0	60	2010-08-01	WOS:000279438400012	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Species composition and biomass was followed for eight years.Results: The sown plants considerably affected the whole successional pathway and the effects persisted during the whole eight year period. Whilst the proportion of sown species (characterized by their cover) increased during the study period, the number of sown species started to decrease from the third season onwards. Sowing caused suppression of natural colonizing species, and the sown plots had more biomass. These effects were on average larger in the high diversity mixtures. However, the low diversity replicate sown with the mixture that produced the largest biomass or largest suppression of natural colonizers fell within the range recorded at the five replicates of the high diversity plots. The natural colonization plots usually had the highest total species richness and lowest productivity at the end of the observation period.Conclusions: The effect of sowing demonstrated dispersal limitation as a factor controlling the rate of early secondary succession.

The experiment consisted of different frequencies (annual, biennial and triennial) of burning and mowing in winter or spring in combination with different frequencies of summer mowing (none, early, late or both).Results: Grasses responded to the type of disturbance (burn or mow) and frequency of burning, whereas forbs responded primarily to the presence or absence of any form of disturbance and secondarily to the timing of burning (spring versus winter). Summer mowing and annual or biennial dormant-period burning maintained communities dominated by short grasses, whereas tall grasses dominated under annual dormant-period mowing, triennial burning or protection from disturbance. Grass tittering strategy (below- or above-ground) influenced response to burning frequency. Many erect herbaceous dicot species with aerial meristems were reduced in abundance by summer mowing whereas most small creeping herbaceous dicot species appeared to be dependent upon summer mowing.Conclusions: This long-term experiment demonstrated that: (1) grasses and forbs responded differently to burning and mowing; (2) simple plant traits, such as height, position of tiller initiation, and position of meristems have potential for predicting the response of species to the timing and frequency of burning and mowing."	58	1	0	0	57	1	64	2005-05-01	WOS:000232547000002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Vegetation development after abandonment can be characterized as a sequence of different successional stages and described in terms of a successional model. Successional stage I includes grazed, mown and recently abandoned sites without dominants. Stages II and III are characterized by the dominance of highly competitive herbaceous species whue stage IV consists of woody vegetation. Ca. 3000 phytosociological releves were assigned to the respective successional stages. Mean cover values were calculated for 250 species of the regional fen flora and assigned to successional categories according to their changes in cover in the successional series. According to our results 141 species decrease during succession, while 100 species were restricted to early successional stages and 85 species increased. Abandonment of all fen sites in Schleswig-Holstein will probably lead to the regional loss of 23 species of the fen flora. To identify mechanisms underlying successional change, the successional categories were correlated with life history traits and ecological requirements of the species. Results indicate that both light competition and limitation of sexual reproduction of small-seeded species might play a major role in the decrease and extinction of species during succession. Finally, conservation strategies for endangered species in a cultural landscape are discussed."	74	0	0	0	59	0	84	1999-05-01	WOS:000208472000010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This study evaluates the seedling emergence response of 18 dry forest species to fire-simulated temperatures, aiming to assess their potential for restoration in fire-prone Colombian ecosystems.LocationThe seeds used in this study were obtained from three tropical dry forests in Colombia.MethodsA total of 9832 seeds from 18 dry forest species were collected directly from the soil seed bank in three tropical dry forests in Colombia. These seeds were then exposed to simulated forest fire temperatures (100 degrees C, 150 degrees C, and 200 degrees C) for 10 min. Seed viability was analyzed using the 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride reagent (tetrazolium test) and assessed using a generalized linear model. Seedling emergence and mean emergence time were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with temperature treatments as factors.ResultsThe study revealed that seedling emergence significantly decreased with higher heat shock temperatures. Notably, Hura crepitans and Parkinsonia aculeata tolerated temperatures up to 100 degrees C, while Caesalpinia pulcherrima and Enterolobium cyclocarpum showed increased emergence at that temperature. Based on their emergence responses, species were classified as stimulated, tolerant, sensitive, or vulnerable. Seed viability declined with rising temperatures, and the mean emergence time increased in species like Cordia alba, Crescentia cujete, and Lonchocarpus violaceus.ConclusionsThis study shows that heat shocks at 150 degrees C and 200 degrees C significantly reduced seed bank viability for most Colombian dry forest species. However, Caesalpinia pulcherrima and Enterolobium cyclocarpum were stimulated by 100 degrees C heat shocks, while Hura crepitans and Parkinsonia aculeata showed no adverse effects. Vulnerable species like Coccoloba acuminata and Pithecellobium dulce exhibited no viable seeds at higher temperatures, suggesting potential local extinctions. These results emphasize the need to focus on heat-tolerant species for restoration efforts in fire-prone ecosystems."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2025-01-07	WOS:001388530200001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Here, we investigated vegetation dynamics in response to three decades of trophic rewilding with large herbivores in a recent anthropogenic, fertile 55- km2 landscape on reclaimed marine sediments. This site provides important insights into plant community assembly in re-wilded, young ecosystems.Location: Oostvaardersplassen, the Netherlands.Methods: Using field surveys and vegetation data spanning two decades, we investi -gate vegetation dynamics of the mesic grasslands in Oostvaardersplassen, a pioneer trophic rewilding site in the Netherlands. To identify the effects of grazing and other ecological processes, we include comparisons to an adjacent ungrazed control site and to the dark diversity, that is, missing species expected to be present given the environ-ment and geography.Results: The impact of large herbivores has led to a more open and homogenous vegeta-tion with higher plant species richness in the mesic grasslands of Oostvaardersplassen compared to the ungrazed control. Compared to species in the dark diversity, the spe -cies present are more common in the region, more stress- tolerant, and less competi-tive, in line with joint effects of grazing and immigrational lag.Conclusions: The changes in vegetation composition and structure show that rewild-ing with large herbivores promotes the prevalence of stress- tolerant and low- staturedplant species, which are in decline in the broader landscape while reducing the domi-nance of otherwise widespread, competition-adapted species.

Addition of carbon is a restoration measure that relies on indirect plant-soil relationships by immobilizing soil nitrogen in microbial biomass to manipulate competitive hierarchies between plant species. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the impact of six years of carbon amendment in old-field restoration in the long term, 20 years after the first application.Location Old-fields and reference sand steppe on dry calcareous sandy soil in Fulophaza, Kiskun LTER site (46 degrees 53 ' N, 19 degrees 24 ' E), Hungary, Pannonian biogeographic region, Europe.Methods We applied carbon amendment in the form of sucrose and sawdust on three abandoned agricultural fields between 1998 and 2003. Vegetation was surveyed in 1998-2006 and re-sampled in 2008, 2010 and 2018 on permanent 2 m x 2 m coenological releves for carbon-amended, control and reference plots (n = 144). We used principal response curves (PRC) to describe vegetation development trajectories and linear mixed-effects models to test changes in cover of vascular plants and cryptogams, nitrogen requirement groups and restoration species groups with time and treatment.Results Carbon amendment resulted in lower soil nitrogen availability, and lower cover of vascular plants and cryptogams compared to control, but these differences became visible only four to five years after the first application and disappeared three years after the cessation of treatment. Minor treatment effects on the cover of oligotrophic, mesotrophic and target species were found.Conclusions Carbon amendment did not speed up the recovery of sand grasslands; however, the reduction of cover (vegetation and cryptogam) can be a window of opportunity for other species to colonize that can be used as a complement to other treatments. Long-term monitoring is especially important in evaluating restoration interventions that focus on indirect above-ground-below-ground linkages."	6	0	0	0	5	0	7	2021-04-25	WOS:000636291500035	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

At the local scale, carbon stock and dynamics can be determined by the environment and ecosystem diversity. Also, during forest regeneration, which is a temporal process, it is expected that those factors that influence carbon also change over time. Here we examine how carbon stock and dynamics are influenced by forest age, environment and functional diversity during forest regeneration. Using the relative effects of the different drivers of carbon dynamics, we attempt to discern the mechanisms (mass effect or niche complementarity) that explain those processes.Location We carried out this study in Atlantic Forest of different ages during natural regeneration in southern Brazil.Methods We measured environmental characteristics (soil physical and chemical attributes and canopy openness), estimated functional diversity and above-ground carbon and its dynamics over time. We examined univariate and multivariate predictors of carbon stock and dynamics using structural equation models.Results We found that age had the strongest influence on carbon stock, while environmental characteristics, functional and taxonomic diversities were much less important or unimportant. Our results suggest that the influence of time on tropical forest carbon dynamics overlaps and outweighs the effects due to environmental limits and mechanisms mediated by diversity (mass effects, niche complementarity).Conclusions Natural regeneration can be an effective strategy for restoring carbon sequestration and methods that use manipulation of regenerating forests with the hope of improving the process are unlikely to bring additional advantage in terms of carbon sequestration."	23	1	0	0	16	0	24	2020-03-26	WOS:000521603400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location A 96 ha temperate forest, Montreal, Canada. Methods We surveyed vegetation and explanatory variables (ecological conditions, disturbances, spatial structure) in 62 plant communities in 1980 and 2011. We collected plant attributes to identify functional groups (FGs). We evaluated changes in beta diversity using tests for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions. We used space-time interaction models to assess changes in FGs spatial structures. We used multivariate analyses to identify relationship between spatial patterns and explanatory variables, and variation partitioning analyses to identify the drivers involved in beta diversity changes. Results Beta diversity declined only in the herb-shrub communities. About 35% of their FGs had significantly changed their spatial distribution over time. Those that contracted their distribution were mainly composed of plants with wind-dispersed seeds or with low to intermediate vegetative propagation capabilities, while those that expanded were plants with fleshy fruits or extensive vegetative propagation capabilities. In 1980, communities were structured into small isolated clumps, while in 2011, clumps expanded and coalesced near disturbed areas. In 1980, the spatial assembly processes relied essentially on endogenous factors while in 2011 exogenous factors, such as disturbances, became more influential. Multivariate analyses suggested that edge effect, past agricultural disturbances, and beaver activities facilitated the decrease of beta diversity (homogenization process). Conclusions The homogenization of herb-shrub communities likely resulted from changes in their clumped spatial structure. FGs with the most adapted attributes to disperse under urban forest conditions were those that expanded spatially. Structural changes seem to have begun with an unpredictable stage governed by dispersal limitation processes, followed by a predictable stage mostly driven by land-use legacy and disturbances."	5	0	0	0	4	1	6	2019-06-06	WOS:000466383400006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To what degree did the vegetation change in hedgerows and how do these changes compare to changes in forests? What is the nature of the species that changed and, from these, can we make general inferences about possible drivers of change? Location The countryside in the municipality of Turnhout, province of Antwerp, northern Belgium. Methods Through a resurvey of 54 and 20 quasi-permanent plots in hedgerows and forests, respectively, we investigated shifts in the herb layer over the period 1974-2015. The plot-level mean Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIVs) were calculated and soil samples were taken in 2015. We compared diversity statistics and used used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models (GLMMs) to detect trends in species richness (SR) and EIVs. Via a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination based on the Sorensen dissimilarity, we compared shifts at the community level. Results Our study shows severe, but opposite changes in SR in forests and hedgerows. In forests, SR declined and a homogenization occurred. The shifts in EIVs indicate that forest vegetation evolved to more shade-tolerant and nutrient-demanding species, likely due to eutrophication combined with natural forest succession. In hedgerows, SR significantly increased. The species pool became more diverse and more heterogeneous. Changes in EIVs suggest a change towards more light-demanding species, possibly caused by fragmentation of the network, and towards species indicative for nutrient-rich habitats, benefiting from eutrophication. Conclusions In general, SR in hedgerows is higher than in forests in our studied region, being a suitable habitat for a wide range of plant species in the countryside. However, the loss of almost 30% of the hedgerow habitat in 41 years confronts us with the challenge of protecting the hedgerow remnants, in the interest of agro-biodiversity."	21	0	0	0	17	0	21	2019-06-06	WOS:000466383400007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The Mediterranean area is expected to be very sensitive to such events because water availability is already limited. However, the effect of precipitation variability on ecosystem services, such as plant productivity, is little known. What is the short-term effect of an experimental precipitation gradient on above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) of two contrasting sub-Mediterranean grassland ecosystems? How does early season precipitation, i.e. dry or wet spring, influence ANPP? Do the functional groups of grasses and forbs differ in their response?LocationTorricchio Nature Reserve, Central Apennines, Italy.MethodsWe selected two grasslands characterized by contrasting geophysical and soil chemical parameters (north- and south-facing slopes). In both sites, during two climatically different years, mid-season (summer) precipitation was manipulated in order to obtain a gradient of rainfall availability, comprising additional rainfall, ambient rainfall conditions and rainfall reduction. The above-ground biomass, subdivided according to the functional groups of forbs and grasses, was collected at the end of each treatment period.ResultsA significant increase in ANPP due to experimental increase in summer rainfall appeared in the year with the wet spring, but only in the mesic north-facing slope. This response was driven by the increased productivity of perennial forbs, while grasses showed stable above-ground production. In contrast, in the year with the dry spring, ANPP did not respond to the experimental rainfall gradient, meaning that a dry spring leads to lower ANPP even under increased summer rainfall. The variability of ANPP increased significantly in the xeric south-facing slope in the year with the wet spring, most likely reflecting indirect effects of small-scale heterogeneity such as variations in soil depth.ConclusionsIntra-annual precipitation variation can have noticeable implications for sub-Mediterranean montane grassland agriculture: to avoid degradation due to overgrazing, livestock pressure should be limited in years with a spring drought, regardless of summer precipitation, especially in mesic grasslands."	52	2	0	0	42	0	56	2016-10-01	WOS:000386136600008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Can this approach provide insight into the dynamics of vegetation in rehabilitating forests?Location: Rehabilitating coastal dune forest in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.Methods: We surveyed sapling and adult trees in seven study sites with similar abiotic conditions that were rehabilitated after mining. Sites ranged in age from 1 to 24 yr in 2001 and we repeated the surveys in 2005 and 2010. We related patterns of change in community attributes (e.g. species composition, turnover, taxonomic and functional diversity) to site age. We compared functional diversity indices (e.g. functional dispersion and evenness) with a random community to infer the ecological processes that structure the tree community during forest development. We focused on the magnitude and direction of change predicted by the 2001 chronosequence with the values returned from subsequent surveys.Results: Species composition changed during forest development. Species richness increased and species turnover decreased. Null models indicated that early stages of forest development had lower functional diversity than expected from a random community, indicating convergence in reproductive traits in early succession. Late stages of forest development showed higher functional diversity. Apart from species composition, the rest of the community attributes recorded from repeated surveys confirmed the predictions made by the chronosequence.Conclusions: The trajectory of plant community succession observed in space across a chronosequence was supported by the site-specific findings derived from long-term monitoring. In the case of our study system (rehabilitating dune forests), space-for-time substitution works. The main drivers of species co-existence changed from environmental filtering and/or dispersal limitation to niche complementarity as these forests developed."	16	1	0	0	14	0	18	2016-06-01	WOS:000374545600008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

(3) How do diversity and CWM patterns respond to disturbance and fertilization gradients measured by agronomic descriptors in both parcel types?LocationFrench Jura Mountains.MethodsWe compared taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversities (based on Rao quadratic entropy) and CWMs between the two management types (SGP and MGP). We then used agronomic variables, describing both defoliation regime and fertilization intensity over the past 10yrs to explain diversity indices and CWMs in a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA).ResultsTaxonomic and phylogenetic diversities were higher in SGP than in MGP, as well as functional diversity computed for qualitative traits (clonal growth organs and leaf distribution along the stem). Contrary to expectations from literature, we found higher CWM for leaf dry matter content (LDMC) in intensively and regularly cut grasslands compared to only grazed grasslands, which can be explained by the higher dominance of grass species in hay meadows. In addition, constrained ordination revealed that taxonomic, phylogenetic and some functional diversity metrics were negatively affected by defoliation intensity (mowing frequency), while most CWMs were mainly influenced by fertilization intensity, either by the available N input or by the role of commercial inorganic fertilizers, depending on the trait considered.ConclusionsOur study revealed consistent patterns between the various facets of biodiversity in grasslands according to the main management regime. Taking agronomic gradients into account suggests the importance of considering both CWMs and functional diversity, which respond variously to agricultural practices. Conservation of high diversity in grasslands, whatever the facet considered, implies keeping some parcels exclusively grazed and limiting N inputs, especially those from inorganic commercial fertilizers."	23	0	0	0	17	0	23	2014-10-01	WOS:000342839200006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to identify the primary water and soil correlates of species cover, after considering the effect of site and point spatial location. The realized niches of dominant species were modeled through GLMs performed on the first two axes of CCA. Niche overlapping among these species was compared with their coexistence, assessed through pairwise correlations of relative species cover in each sampling point.Results: Water and soil variables explained more of the variation in species' abundance than site and spatial position. Mean water table level, maximum water conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), summarized in the two first CCA axes, explained 23.8% of the variability in species' cover. Arthrocnemum fruticosum, Phragmites australis subsp. australis, Juncus acutus, Spartina versicolor and Juncus maritimus dominated the vegetation stands. Niches obtained from GLM response curves showed moderate overlapping among all these species except for A. fruticosum. However, pairwise correlations were mainly negative or nonsignificant, indicating low coincidence, and even segregation, between species' cover.Conclusions: The abundance of dominant plants in Mediterranean marshes is only partly explained by the environmental gradients summarized in niche models.

Changes in lichen diversity and community composition call be attritbuted to the development of Calluna stand structure following burning.Conclusions: Fire call be seen to play all important role in maintaining the diversity of lichens in heathland areas by providing a variety of stand-structures and ages across the landscape that favours the development of greater beta-diversity."	17	0	0	0	14	0	20	2008-12-01	WOS:000264980100011	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How does the ability to distinguish plots by community composition vary with spatial scale, specifically number of patch types. patch size and spatial correlation? Both these questions bear on the effective use of stratifying variables in landscape ecology.Location: Arctic tundra Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. northwestern Alaska. USA.Methods: We evaluated the strength Of numerous alternative stratifying variables using the multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP). We also created groups based on lichen community composition, using cluster analyses, and evaluated the relationship between these groups and groupings Within categorical variables using Mantel tests. Each test represents different measures of community separation, which were then evaluated with respect to each variable's spatial characteristics.Results: We found each categorical variable derived from GIS separated lichen communities to some degree. Separation success ranged from strong (Alaska Subsections) to Weak (Watersheds and Reindeer Ownership). Lichen community groups derived from cluster analysis demonstrated statistically significant relationships with 13 of the 17 categorical variables. Partialling Out effects of spatial distance had little effect on these relationships.Conclusions: Greater number of patch types and larger average patch sizes contribute to optimal success in separating lichen communities; geographic distance did not appear to significantly alter separation success. Group distinctiveness or strength increased with more patch types or groups. Alternatively, congruence between lichen community types derived from cluster analysis and the 17 categorical variables was inversely related to patch size and spatial correlation."	5	0	0	0	4	0	5	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	YES

Appearance and disappearance rates of grassland species were calculated for pairs of consecutive years. 1. Mean appearance and disappearance rates were compared in grassland plots dominated by C. epigejos and in plots free from this species, based on Monte Carlo randomization. 2. Mean appearance rates were assessed for categories of C. epigejos performance and their confidence intervals were calculated via Monte Carlo randomization. For two performance variables (percentage cover and shoot number) analyses were performed at two spatial scales.Results: 1. C. epigejos-dominated plots differed from unaffected ones by significantly lower appearance rates. 2. Change in appearance rates was best explained by differences in percentage cover of C. epigejos. Coarse-scale C. epigejos performance had a closer correspondence with appearance rate change than fine-scale performance. Low level C. epigejos performance enhanced appearance rate compared to intact stands, while high level performance decreased it, regardless of the choice of performance measure.Conclusions: C. epigejos lowers species number by hindering reappearance of species of the original grassland. This is best explained by the increased shading effect at the coarse scale. The marked non-linear initial enhancement in appearance rate, however, can also be taken as an early sign of future species loss."	67	0	1	0	57	0	76	2008-04-01	WOS:000255229600005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Can grazing compensate for atmospheric nutrient loads in heathland ecosystems? What are the conclusions for heathland management?Location: Luneburg Heath, NW Germany.Methods: During a one-year grazing experiment (stocking rate 1.1 sheep/ha) nutrient balances for N, Ca, K, Mg and P were calculated by quantifying input rates (atmospheric deposition, sheep excrement) and output rates (biomass removal, leaching).Results: Atmospheric nutrient deposition amounted to 22.8 kg. ha(-1). a(-1) for N and < 0.2 kg. ha(-1). a(-1) for P. Sheep excrement increased the inputs for N and P by ca. 3.5 and 0.2 kg. ha(-1). a(-1), respectively.

However, in the long term the combination of elevated N- deposition and P-loss due to grazing may cause a shift from N-(co-) limited to more P-(co-)limited plant growth. To counteract an aggravation of P- deficiency in the long term, grazing may be combined with management measures that affect P- budgets to a lesser extent (e. g. prescribed burning)."	18	0	0	0	16	0	18	2007-12-01	WOS:000250089300011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Additional soil and biogeographic data were collected. Data were analysed by Canonical Correspondence Analysis, which allowed the impact of moorland management to be examined.Results: All sites showed good restoration success when the dominant managed species (Calluna vulgaris, Molinia caerulea and Nardus stricta) were considered. Restoration success of the remainder of the plant assemblage, disregarding these dominant species, was lower with restored samples at some sites differing little from their respective degraded samples. Moors restored solely by grazing exclusion were more similar to their respective targets than were those restored by more intensive mechanical means. The most important factors in explaining vegetation assemblages were management status (i.e. whether samples represented degraded, restored or target parts of the moor) and latitude.Conclusions: The project demonstrates that, where possible, restoration should be attempted by grazing exclusion alone. Furthermore the importance of applying local restoration targets and of monitoring the whole plant assemblages when assessing the success of moorland restoration is highlighted."	13	0	0	0	11	0	14	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600016	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Survival and growth were monitored for six years. Our hypothesis is that the use of shrubs as nurse plants is an alternative technique of reforestation with higher success than traditional techniques, in which pre-existing vegetation is usually considered a source of competition. The rationale for the study was that for environments with a dry season, pre-existing vegetation buffers summer drought stress, ameliorates the water status of seedlings and thus usually increases seedling recruitment.Results: Quercus survival was 6.3 x higher when planted under individuals of the pioneer shrub as compared to open areas. Quercus seedlings under shrubs also had shoots 1.8 x longer, while the number of shoots per plant did not differ among treatments. The first summer was the period with the highest mortality (49.1 % of seedlings). Summer drought was the main cause of mortality.Conclusions: The use of shrubs as nurse plants for Q. pyrenaica reforestation is a viable technique to increase establishment success. The technique could be similarly useful in other environments with a dry period and for other Quercus species. In addition, this technique offers the advantage of following natural succession, thus minimizing the impact in the community."	65	5	0	0	48	3	71	2006-05-01	WOS:000242292500016	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

While topsoil removal almost completely removed the seed bank, groundwater level rise did not permanently submerge the seed bank of species of oligotrophic, wet conditions. Chanaes in abundance in the established vegetation were unrelated to species abundance in the seed bank. Of all new species establishments in the vegetation releves, 76% occurred where the species was not found in the seed bank. The chance that presence of a species in the seed bank led to establishment the following year was only 11%.Conclusion: The seed bank was not the dominant source for newly establishing species following the large disturbance that was induced by restoration management. Changes in species abundance after the restoration impact were not related to species abundance in the seed bank, but to ongoing succession and current year dispersal. To attain a high number of new establishments, restoration projects should preferably be planned in the proximity of refuge populations, rather than relying on the seed bank alone."	38	7	0	0	36	0	50	2005-05-01	WOS:000232547000006	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Calluna cover increased yearly and exceeded 50 % three years after burning. Regeneration was evident in the year of burning, and was highest in heath with a short burning interval. The height increased regularly at all sites, but was most rapid in dry heath, probably because of better microclimatic conditions.

To what extent do these different treatments affect productivity and sward structure of an agriculturally improved grassland? Location: A mesic lowland grassland near Gottingen, Lower Saxony. Germany. Methods: Recruitment success of eight sown wildflower species was studied in a permanent grassland treated by a factorial combination of different pre-sowing cutting intervals (1.3 or 9 wk). post-sowing cutting intervals (1, 3 or 9 wk) and disturbance (control. harrowing, removal of sward). Seedling emergence and survival. biomass production and sward structure were followed over two years. Results: For most species seedling emergence was highest in the harrowing treatment. The complete sward removal did not further increase seedling emergence. Seedling survival was strongly influenced by the post-sowing cutting frequency with highest mortality in the 9 wk cutting interval compared to one and 3 wk cutting intervals. Annual dry matter yield varied between 4.4, 5.9 and 9.4 t.ha-1 in the 1, 3 and 9 wk pre-sowing cutting treatment, respectively. In June, when the seeds were sown. the tiller number of the I wk cut plots was twice as high as for the 9 wk cut plots and five times higher than in the harrowing treatment. Conclusions: Disturbance by harrowing provided the optimal environmental cues to trigger germination, whereas seedling survival was facilitated by increased light penetration due to frequent cutting.

Methods: A field experiment was conducted at two sites to assess the effect of seed addition, sowing date and cutting regime on the vegetation developing on former arable land. the aim being to compare the success of different treatments at producing a species-rich grassland.Results: Sowing a seed mix resulted in the establishment of vegation very distinct from the species-poor vegetation dominated by perennial grasses which otherwise developed, though establishment success of the sown grassland species was highly variable between sites. Where establishment of the sown species was poor. sowing date had no significant effect on species composition, whereas the cutting regime was very important. Cutting the vegetation significantly increased both the number and abundance of sown species compared with the uncut control. Conversely, where establishment had been good, the cutting regime in the first year had little effect on species composition. Cutting the vegetation at least twice a year appeared to be the most effective management over the length of the experiment.Conclusions: Sowing a seed mixture significantly reduced the abundance and number of naturally colonising species, effectively controlling problem weed species such as Senecio jacobaea and Cirsium vidgare, highlighting the agronomic value of sowing seed mixtures on fallow farmland.

Treatments included abandonment, mowing in fall and mowing with creation of gaps in the moss and litter layer. Floating capacity of seeds was tested in order to estimate potential dispersal by water.On the mown meadow, gaps had a slightly positive effect on germination rates, while greatly increasing seedling survival until the next spring. At the abandoned site, litter inhibited germination, whereas mosses had a negative effect on germination and a positive effect on survival rates during the first year after germination. Both germination and seedling establishment were negatively affected by the presence of slug herbivores. On the abandoned site, no seedlings at all survived until the next spring. Even though seeds of Succisella inflexa were capable to float for several weeks and to germinate thereafter, the situation at the field sites indicates that long-distance dispersal is highly unlikely. Our results showed that not only direct effects of abandonment, such as accumulation of litter, may have led to poor germination and poor seedling establishment of the species. Additionally, indirect consequences of changes in land use, such as higher seedling herbivory by slugs and successional vegetation changes due to abandonment, were important in determining habitat quality and availability of microsites for seedling recruitment.

Grazing intensity had a significant, directional effect on the relative composition of short- and mid-grass response groups; their composition was significantly correlated with time since the grazing regimes were established. Interannual precipitation was not significantly correlated with response group composition. However, interannual precipitation was significantly correlated with total plant basal area while time since imposition of grazing regimes was not, L but both interannual precipitation and tit-no since the grazing regimes were established were significantly correlated with total plant density. Vegetation change was reversible even though the herbaceous community had been maintained in an altered state for ca. 60 yr by intensive livestock grazing. However, ca, 25 yr were required for the mid-grass response group to recover following the elimination of grazing and recovery occurred intermittently. The increase in mid-grass composition was associated with a significant decrease in total plant density and an increase in mean individual plant basal area. Therefore, we failed to reject the hypotheses based on the proportional change in relative response group composition with grazing intensity and the distinct effects of grazing and climatic variability on response group composition, total basal area and plant density. Long-term vegetation change indicates that grazing intensity established the long-term directional change in response group composition, but that episodic climate events defined the short-term rate and trajectory of this change and determines the upper limit on total basal area. The occurrence of both directional and non-directional vegetation responses were largely a function of (1) the unique responses of the various community attributes monitored and (2) the distinct temporal responses of those community attributes to grazing and climatic variation.

If so, then what are the traits that explain differences? Remnant prairies, which serve as reference sites for restorations, often have higher plant species diversity and a lower abundance of exotic (non-native) species than their restoration counterparts. They may differ in their community-weighted functional traits as well, although this is poorly studied.Location: Tallgrass prairies and abandoned fields in Iowa, United States, North America. Methods: We compared functional traits between remnant prairies, restoration seed mixes, and established restorations to determine if community-weighted trait values ( n-expressionry sumexpressiontion p(i) x traits) are comparable. Relative abundance was determined by previous sampling of 93 restorations, 48 seed mixes and five remnant sites. Functional traits, including leaf specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and plant height, were measured for 145 native and 39 non-native plant species, 663 plants, and 1326 leaves.Results: Seed mixes had greater community-weighted LDMC and lower SLA than remnants, perhaps because of human selection for high grass abundance in mixes. Established restorations had lower community-weighted LDMC and higher SLA than remnants and seed mixes, and restorations had a large exotic species component. The proportional abundance of exotics in restorations explained trait differences between remnants and restorations. After taking into account functional groupings, perennial exotic species, on average, had higher SLA and lower LDMC than perennial native species. Remnants and established restorations had similar plant heights, and height was not significantly different between native and exotic species.Conclusions: Our results indicate that seed mixes differ from remnants in a manner that was the opposite of the difference between seed mixes and established restorations. Although seed mixes favored species with slower growth rate trait compositions, the species that established in restored prairies tended to have traits associated with faster growth rates. We recommend developing prairie restoration seed mixes with a greater proportion of forbs, especially those with lower LDMC and higher SLA."	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2023-08-20	WOS:000918906500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Meanwhile, how different livestock species affect community structure is not fully understood. In northern China, livestock species composition is changing rapidly and hence, it is imperative to understand the resulting effects on grassland productivity and composition. Location Xilingol, Inner Mongolia, China. Methods We studied how grazing by three major livestock species affects typical steppe dominated by Leymus chinensis, Stipa grandis, Cleistogenes squarrosa and Carex korshinskyi, in a 4-year field experiment using a random block-design with four treatments (sheep, goat, cattle, no grazing), under summer grazing at moderate intensity. We calculated above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and a selectivity index (SI) based on biomass to quantify livestock forage preferences. Result We found that (i) sheep preferred Leymus chinensis and mixed subordinate species, cattle preferred Stipa grandis, and goat preferred Carex korshinskyi and Cleistogenes squarrosa. (ii) Consistent with these preferences, sheep increased the relative biomass of Stipa grandis, but reduced that of Carex korshinskyi; cattle reduced the relative biomass of Stipa grandis and Carex korshinskyi but increased that of mixed subordinate species; and goats reduced the relative biomass of Cleistogenes squarrosa and Carex korshinskyi but increased that of mixed subordinate species. (iii) Overall, grazing significantly increased ANPP, mainly due to an increase in ANPP of Leymus chinensis and subordinate species, at the cost of Stipa grandis. Conclusions Summer grazing by different livestock species at moderate intensity can increase ANPP, while livestock forage preferences can drive divergent changes in species composition. Our results also imply that livestock composition can be used as a mean to manage vegetation dynamics."	20	2	0	0	16	0	23	2022-09-23	WOS:000854868400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Location Spruce stands in the Erzgebirge, East Germany. Methods We repeated herb and bryophyte layer surveys on 36 quasi-permanent plots after approx. 23 years (1989/1991 vs 2012/2014). Over this period, the study area experienced a sharp decline in S deposition and repeated liming of the spruce stands. Our plots represent a gradient of liming from zero to four applications. We analyse the change in species composition and species diversity depending on the liming intensity using Ellenberg indicator values (EIV), correspondence analysis, indicator species analysis and diversity parameters (alpha diversity, Lennon similarity). Results On the unlimed plots, the species composition of the herb layer remained unchanged over the study period, despite the decrease in the coverage of Calamagrostis villosa and Deschampsia flexuosa and in the total coverage of the herb layer. In contrast, the bryophyte layer showed a significant increase in coverage and species richness with the decrease in S deposition. Liming led to a sharp increase in species richness in the herb layer, due to the appearance of disturbance indicators. The mean EIVs for acidity and nitrogen (EIV-R and EIV-N) also increased significantly. All observed effects increased with increasing liming intensity. We also noticed an increase in species richness over time in the bryophyte layer on the limed plots. However, this was less pronounced than on the unlimed plots, and decreased with increasing liming intensity. This was because the appearance of disturbance indicators or of typical species for the Calamagrostio villosae-Piceetum was partially compensated for by the disappearance of acid indicators as a result of liming. The species turnover was thus much higher in the bryophyte layer than in the herb layer. Conclusions In contrast to the herb layer, the bryophyte layer proves to be a sensitive indicator of changes in air pollution. The effects of greatly reduced S deposition on the bryophyte layer outweigh those of continuous N deposition in the study area. Liming acts as a disturbance in both the herb layer and the bryophyte layer. This influence increases with increasing liming intensity. Our results do not support a general application of liming in large, contiguous forest areas. Rather, this measure should be applied in a differentiated manner."	11	0	0	0	8	0	11	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In this study, we examined short- and long-term (two and 15 years) changes in fuels and understorey vegetation after treatment in chaparral and oak-dominated stands.Location Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, California, USA.Methods Treatments, including hand thinning, mastication only, burn only, and mastication + burning, were applied randomly to one or two units within each of 10 blocks across two vegetation types (chaparral and oak-dominated). Vegetation data were initially measured two years after treatment and remeasured 15 years later with additional sampling of dead surface fuels and shrubs. Fuel and vegetation data were analyzed to examine the effect of treatment, time, and vegetation type.Results In chaparral stands, shrub height and cover in the hand-thinning, mastication, and mastication + burning treatments were still lower than in the control after 15 years. However, only the hand-thinning treatment reduced fine woody fuels. Hand thinning and mastication + burning increased native species richness after two years, but this was also associated with an increase in exotic species richness and cover that persisted after 15 years. In oak-dominated stands, treatments had varied and relatively fewer changes to fuels and vegetation. Shrub height was reduced in both the hand-thinning and Burn-only treatments, but only mastication reduced shrub cover. Species richness and vegetative cover were largely unaffected by treatment in oak-dominated stands, except for lower native plant cover in mastication and mastication + burning treatments.Conclusion Treatments varied in their level of effectiveness and most involved trade-offs between their impacts on fuels and vegetation responses that differed by vegetation type and time. Our findings provide insights for managers interested in balancing these trade-offs when making fuel treatment decisions and emphasize the importance of examining longer-term effectiveness of fuels treatments."	7	1	0	0	5	0	8	2020-12-24	WOS:000597761400001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

For proper rangeland management it is crucial to compare the grazing effects of traditional breeds and crossbred animals of the same species that might have different effects on the rangelands. To fill this knowledge gap, in a grazing experiment, we investigated the effect of cattle breeds on the vegetation to test the effects on nature conservation value and agricultural production value. We hypothesized that the effects of cattle grazing on habitat conservation values and forage quality depend on the grazing breed, because breeds differ in selectivity, body size and trampling effect. Location Marshes and alkaline wet grasslands in Hortobagy National Park, Hungary. Methods We recorded the percentage cover of vascular plants in three consecutive years in a total of 60 plots in 12 areas grazed by traditional (0.61 AU/ha) and large-sized crossbred beef cattle (0.68 AU/ha). Results We found that the effect of cattle breed on the habitat conservation values and forage quality is dependent on the habitat type. The traditional breed maintained a significantly higher species number and Shannon diversity in marshes than the crossbred beef cattle. Grazing of crossbred cattle led to decreasing moisture indicator values in marsh habitats. Conclusions Our findings revealed that traditional breeds should be prioritized in the management of wet alkaline grasslands and marshes. Crossbred beef cattle might be a substitute but only in case traditional breeds are not available for the management of alkaline wet grasslands. In marshes, however, we recommend prioritizing the traditional breeds as they maintain higher diversity compared to crossbred beef cattle."	12	0	0	0	9	1	16	2020-01-29	WOS:000509801600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

A total of 1,613 plots were classified using supervised K-means clustering through the programme JUICE. The Phi co-efficient for presence/absence data was used to measure fidelity of the vegetation communities.Results: The vegetation communities could be initially sub-divided in to four main categories: (1) bryophyte-dominated aquatic vegetation, (2) bryophyte-dominated marginal vegetation, (3) vascular plant-dominated aquatic vegetation and (4) vascular plant-dominated marginal/emergent vegetation. Within these four categories the vegetation was classified into seven classes, 18 alliances and 30 associations.

To address this issue, the following questions were asked: (1) does smoke stimulate germination of soil-stored seeds in renosterveld; (2) does recently-burned renosterveld display changed composition and higher diversity than unburned vegetation; and (3) how do the species compositions of renosterveld soil seed banks and standing vegetation compare?LocationSwartland, Cape Floristic Region, South Africa.MethodsSoil seed bank samples from a north- and south-facing slope were smoke-treated and germinated to test for smoke-stimulated germination. Burned standing vegetation was surveyed 16months post-fire, as was unburned vegetation on the same slopes. Seed bank species richness and density were compared between smoke-treated and untreated samples within and between slopes. Burned and unburned standing vegetation were compared within and between slopes in terms of species richness, abundance and aerial cover. Compositional similarity of the seed banks and standing vegetation was assessed.ResultsSeed banks were dominated by annuals and graminoids. Smoke treatment had no effect, except for driving significantly higher species richness and seedling density in south-facing slope perennial shrubs. Species richness and seedling density were significantly higher in seed banks on the south-facing slope compared to the north-facing slope. Burned standing vegetation exhibited significantly higher diversity than unburned vegetation. Annuals and graminoids displayed significantly higher species richness and aerial cover in burned renosterveld. The north-facing slope contained less than half the number of species/m(2) compared to the south-facing slope. The seed banks and standing vegetation showed low to intermediate similarity (SOrensen=31%-53%), but grouped close together on an NMDS plot, suggesting intermediate similarity overall.ConclusionsElevated germination of perennial shrubs in smoke-treated seed bank samples and increased diversity of post-fire standing vegetation suggest the renosterveld in this study shows elements of a fire-driven system. Certain species only recruited in burned sites, suggesting fire-stimulated germination. Aspect had a major influence on plant community composition, with the mesic south-facing slope being more diverse than the xeric north-facing slope. The similarity between the seed banks and standing vegetation was higher than previously shown for renosterveld, and appears to be higher than for fynbos."	5	1	0	0	5	0	6	2018-12-28	WOS:000425120600016	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, the two vegetation properties may not respond in a similar way to environmental and disturbance gradients, leading to uninformed management planning and difficulties when attempting to restore degraded ecosystems. In this context, we addressed two main questions: (1) how close are relations between floristic and physiognomic types as defined by numerical vegetation classification in mountain ecosystems; and (2) how are floristic and physiognomic types distributed along the elevation gradient?LocationCentral mountains of Argentina, between 500 and 1700m a.s.l.MethodsWe selected 437 sites where we performed complete floristic and physiognomic releves. We classified eight physiognomic and eight floristic types. We tested the relationship between the two classifications through a chi square analysis. We tested the association between elevation and each physiognomic and floristic type with random permutations.ResultsIn general, floristic types were significantly and positively associated with more than one physiognomic type and vice versa. Physiognomic and floristic types responded differently to the elevation gradient. Floristic types were restricted to different sections of the gradient, although having large overlap among them. In contrast, seven out of the eight physiognomic types did not show elevation restriction, being distributed along the complete elevation gradient. The open low woodland with shrubs was the only restricted physiognomy, significantly absent from the upper part of the gradient.ConclusionsWe highlight the importance of considering the two vegetation properties independently when characterizing vegetation patterns in heterogeneous systems, since they show decoupled responses to environmental gradients. We note that the assumption of a direct link between floristic composition and physiognomy may induce bias into the understanding of vegetation patterns and processes. Hence, we encourage managers and restoration practitioners to consider the complete range of possible physiognomic types under each floristic type."	76	3	0	0	67	7	84	2017-10-01	WOS:000412077700004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Although geochemical recovery has been observed since then, there has been little recovery of ecological communities, and the reasons are unclear. Positive feedbacks between anthropogenic acidification and ecosystem engineers are likely to contribute to this lag in recovery, but are under- investigated so far. Here we hypothesize that positive feedbacks between past anthropogenic acidification and on- going biogenic habitat modification by peat moss species (genus Sphagnum) will have long- term effects on plant community composition of acidified spring fens. Location: Spring fens in forest landscapes of central Germany's siliceous mountain ranges impacted by anthropogenic acidification until the late 1980s, and with strong increases in abundance of Sphagnum during the last 25 yrs. Methods: Vegetation surveys (vascular plants, mosses and liverworts) and hydro- chemical water measurements of 54 spring fens over a study period of 25 yrs (1989- 2013). Measurements of water pH and discharge were used, in combination with Ellenberg indicator values of the occurring plant species, to investigate the joint effects of anthropogenic acidification and biogenic habitat modification. Results: Changing plant communities (excluding Sphagnum spp.) indicated significant increases in acidification of spring fens with high Sphagnum cover, although pH of the outpouring groundwater showed no temporal trends. Path analysis revealed significant enhancing effects of Sphagnum abundance on the community- indicated acidity, which was independent of the abiotic acidity regime (water pH). With increasing species richness through time, community assembly became increasingly similar and shifted towards acid- tolerant species. Characteristic plant species of non- acidified spring fens like Chrysosplenium oppositifolium were replaced by generalist grass, sedge and tree species (e. g., Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica, Calamagrostis villosa and Carex remota). Conclusions: Based on long- term monitoring data we show that biogenic habitat modification by ecosystem engineers can significantly change plant community composition on a decadal scale in a landscape where historic anthropogenic acidification heavily impacted ecosystem functioning. These complex functional legacies stress the importance of considering the history and memory of ecosystems in global change impact research."	13	0	0	0	10	0	15	2017-04-01	WOS:000398083700007	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In contrast, the characteristic rich fen species Scorpidium scorpioides expanded locally near the ditch. In the rich fen zone, peak above-ground biomass decreased from ca. 1000 to 250 g.m(-2). Also, foliar N:P ratios in vascular plant tissues increased from 16 to more than 22 g.g(-1), which clearly point to lower P availability over time. Improved surface water quality probably also promoted persistence of rich fen habitats in a different way. A large part of the rich fen peatland in 1988 changed into Sphagnum peatland by 2013, probably due to the reduction of base-rich water from below the floating root mat. This mat had become ca. 35 cm thicker in the past 50 yr. However, in areas closer to the ditch, rich fen species persisted, due to inundation with base-rich water during high water periods. Base-rich water probably no longer comes to the surface through the floating root mat, but more likely from the ditch.Conclusions: Water quality improvement can be important in the long-term re-establishment of target fen species. Also, local inundation can be helpful if regional groundwater access becomes limited. In the national park, rich fens are more threatened than Sphagnum peatlands. This study suggests that the rich fen stage can be maintained, and succession towards Sphagnum peatland prevented, with occasional inundation with high pH, nutrient-poor water."	10	0	0	0	10	0	10	2016-02-03	WOS:000368074600008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do the impacts of ungulates on exotic vs native plants depend on forest management activities such as prescribed fire and stand thinning?Location: Northeastern Oregon, USA.Methods: We recorded changes in richness and cover of different exotic and native plant life forms in experimental plots that were grazed only by cattle (a non-native herbivore), only by elk (a native herbivore) or not grazed by any ungulate over a 7-yr period at both managed (recently burned and thinned) and unmanaged (where no fire and thinning has occurred in >40 yr) forest stands.Results: There was a general decrease in exotic plant species richness and cover across all treatments. However, the decrease in exotic richness, particularly of exotic annual forbs, was slightly lower in plots grazed by elk than in ungrazed plots at managed stands. Managed stands also displayed a larger increase in native annual forb richness and exotic graminoid richness, and a larger decrease in native perennial graminoid cover with cattle grazing than elk grazing. At unmanaged stands, cover of woody native plants such as shrubs, sub-shrubs and trees as well as native perennial forbs decreased or remained relatively constant with elk grazing while increasing strongly at plots that were ungrazed or grazed by cattle.Conclusions: Cattle and elk have variable effects on different plant guilds at managed vs unmanaged forest stands. Overall, cattle grazing tends to have a larger impact on herbaceous plant guilds at managed stands, while elk grazing tends to have a larger impact on woody plant guilds at unmanaged stands. However, in contrast to findings from other ecosystems, grazing only has a minor impact on exotic plant dynamics in our study area, and cattle grazing does not favour exotic plants any more than grazing by elk or ungulate exclusion."	10	0	0	0	8	0	11	2016-02-03	WOS:000368074600006	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Is species richness higher in restored pastures adjacent to an intact semi-natural pasture than in restored pastures adjacent to arable land? Does community similarity between a restored and an adjacent intact pasture decrease with distance from the border between the two pastures? Do differences in species richness and community similarity decrease over time?LocationAgricultural landscapes in south-central Sweden.MethodsThe plant community in previously abandoned but now restored semi-natural pastures was surveyed along a distance gradient from the border between the restored pastures and adjacent fields towards the centre of the pastures. The restored pastures were located adjacent to either a crop field (N=8) or a continuously grazed pasture (N=6), and differed in time since restoration (1-13yr).ResultsThe total species richness was higher in pastures adjoining continuously grazed pastures compared to crop fields. Richness of both total and specialist species increased with time since restoration. Irrespective of adjacent land use, richness of specialist species decreased with increasing distance from the edge, an effect that became weaker with increasing time since restoration. The similarity in species composition compared to that in adjacent continuously grazed pasture also decreased towards the centre of the restored pasture.ConclusionsOur results suggest that restoration of biodiversity in semi-natural pastures benefits from adjacent pastures that can act as source habitats. The most likely mechanism is step-wise short-distance dispersal, but also other processes, such as more long-distance dispersal, seed bank dynamics and historical legacies are probably involved. To best succeed in habitat restoration in fragmented landscapes, the spatial location of source populations must be considered."	39	0	0	0	34	0	40	2015-07-01	WOS:000356007400007	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is this time-scale the same for individual plant species, plant community composition and functional traits?Location: Defence Training Estate Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, UK.Methods: We investigated the rate of natural regeneration of species-rich calcareous grassland across a 20 000-ha landscape. We combined a large-scale botanical survey with historic land-use data (6-150 yrs before present) and examined differences between grassland age classes in the occurrence of individual plant species, plant community composition and plant community functional traits.Results: Many species showed a significant association with grasslands over 100 yrs old. These included the majority of those defined elsewhere as calcareous grassland indicators, although some appeared on grasslands <10 yrs old. Plant community composition showed increasing similarity to the oldest grasslands with increased grassland age, with the exception of very recently ex-agricultural grasslands. Most functional traits showed clear trends with grassland age, with dispersal ability differing most strongly between recent and older grasslands, whilst soil fertility and pH tolerance were more influential over longer time-scales.Conclusions: Even in a well connected landscape, natural regeneration to a community resembling ancient calcareous grassland in terms of functional traits and plant community composition takes over a century, although changes at the level of individual species may occur much earlier. These findings confirm the uniqueness of ancient calcareous grassland. They also suggest that the targets of re-establishment efforts should be adjusted to account for the likely time-scale of full community re-assembly."	45	0	0	0	39	0	49	2014-07-01	WOS:000337725300005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To what degree does the share of characteristic alvar grassland species in the soil seed bank change during secondary succession from traditionally managed pasture towards stages overgrown by Corylus avellana and Juniperus communis?Location: Northern Estonia.Methods: The species composition of above-ground vegetation and the persistent soil seed bank were investigated in successional alvar grasslands. Particular attention was given to typical grassland species in the persistent soil seed bank. Soil seed bank density was also recorded. General linear models and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to assess successional trends and the restoration potential of the soil seed bank.Results: The cessation of traditional management has led to a considerable decline in above-ground plant species richness. The composition of above-ground vegetation in different successional stages was considerably more variable than that of the seed bank. We detected large and species-rich persistent soil seed banks in all our study sites. About 70% of species in the seed banks of overgrown sites could be classified as typical grassland species. The frequency of typical alvar grassland species, such as Arabis hirsuta, Arenaria serpyllifolia, Cerastium fontanum, Helianthemum nummularium, Poa angustifolia, Potentilla crantzii, Sedum acre and Veronica spicata in the seed bank of long-term abandoned (25 and 50 yr) sites was unexpectedly high.Conclusions: Abandoned semi-natural grassland sites in northern Estonia still contain a relatively large grassland community species pool, including a large and effective soil seed bank.

Quercus ilex and Pinus sylvestris establishment was evident only from the late 1970s onward. Recruitment events were related to reductions in livestock browsing. J. thurifera spatial structure was clumped and Q. ilex showed a short-scale aggregation to J. thurifera trees and saplings. Radial growth trends of J. thurifera saplings, Q. ilex and P. sylvestris were negatively related to livestock density. Summer drought limited the radial growth of all the study species, and P. sylvestris and Q. ilex grew faster than J. thurifera even after considering an age effect.Conclusions: The differences in radial growth patterns and recruitment pulses between species indicate that livestock browsing and not abiotic factors is the main factor controlling plant succession and structural development. In this process, J. thurifera acts as a nurse plant, facilitating the establishment of other tree species. Under the current low pressure from herbivores, formerly pure J. thurifera woodlands will change towards dense stands of mixed species composition."	42	0	0	0	36	0	44	2010-02-01	WOS:000273601700002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	YES

What are the effects of topsoil, subsoil and fertilization on natural revegetation?Location: Akershus county, SE Norway (10 degrees 25' E. 59 degrees 44' N).Methods: We used a recently constructed road through a boreal coniferous forest for a three year (2000-2002), fully replicated revegetation experiment (six replications). Treatments were soil type (two levels: one topsoil and one subsoil type) and fertilization (two levels: NPK and unfertilized control). Ordination methods, constrained ordination methods as well as univariate statistical methods. Such as Wilcoxon's signed-rank test and correlation analvsis, were used to assess the relative importance and significance of treatments on the plant species composition.Results: There was no fertilization effect on species composition. The species composition on both soil types was stabilised by the second year. The species dominating the topsoil were more in accordance with the indigenous vegetation than was the case on the subsoil. The significant difference in species composition among blocks, persisting for the entire study period. indicated that local factors are important determinants of the outcome of revegetation.Conclusion: Unfertilized topsoil provides a revegetation result in better accordance with the indigenous vegetation than does subsoil."	7	0	0	0	7	0	10	2008-12-01	WOS:000264980100006	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The importance of aspect was confirmed then within each substrate type. Most species with a short life span (mostly annuals and a few biennials), together with some woody species on Arkoses, showed no response to age (years following the deposition of new soil). Others short-lived species declined over time on the poorer wastes but not on the better Arkoses. There was a tendency for life form replacement (from therophytes to hemicryptophytes) during succession only on the poorer-quality substrates. No dispersal-mode replacement sequence was found.Conclusion: Improving the abiotic conditions of the substrate had a great effect on vegetation succession, but this effect was modified by aspect. Aspect took longer to induce differences in floristic composition on the poorer substrates, where succession was slower. Some trends in species responses to successional change were found by considering species traits, particularly life-form."	52	3	0	0	45	0	59	2007-12-01	WOS:000250089300005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In this study, short-term effects - a 2-yr period - of human trampling on some common forest and heath communities in Central Belgium were studied experimentally. Vulnerability to disturbance was compared among plant communities in terms of resistance, resilience and tolerance, which are based on cover measurements. The herb layer of the examined mesophilous forest communities appeared to be more sensitive than the heath and dry forest community, which were dominated by more resistant graminoid (Molinia caerulea, Deschampsia flexuosa) and dwarf-shrub species (Vaccinium myrtillus, Calluna vulgaris, Erica tetralix). The analysis showed that site structure and vegetation were already affected by low intensities of trampling, while vegetation recovery during the first year after trampling was limited in most plant communities. Recovery during the second year in vegetation cover as well as height was most pronounced in mesophilous forest communities. Occasional trampling clearly can lead to increased visual evidence of previous use and continued recreational disturbance. Therefore management plans should discourage hiking activity off paths and restrict recreation activities to the least vulnerable communities."	60	5	0	0	40	0	72	2004-05-01	WOS:000221960200013	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Results of Redundancy Analysis (RDA) indicated that salinity and the depth of anoxic conditions below the surface were the most important soil factors related to the spatial vegetation pattern. Furthermore, plant species distribution was influenced by present and past grazing intensity, by soil grain size and nitrogen content.Vegetation changes over 9 yr were analysed by non-linear regression. The cover of Aster tripolium, Atriplex portulacoides, and, to a lesser extent, Artemisia maritima and Elymus athericus increased due to reduced grazing pressure. whereas the cover of Salicornia europaea decreased.

The cover of Puccinellia, Festuca, Suaeda maritima, Glaux maritima and Salicornia fluctuated strongly, probably due to differences in weather conditions and inundation frequency.

Spatial heterogeneity, an important characteristic in semi-arid grassland vegetation, may be altered through grazing by large herbivores. We used Moran's I, a measure of autocorrelation, to test the effect of livestock grazing on the fine scale spatial heterogeneity of dominant plant species in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. Autocorrelation in ungrazed plots was significantly higher than in grazed plots for the cover of the dominant species Bouteloua gracilis, litter cover and density of other bunchgrasses. No species had higher autocorrelation in grazed compared to ungrazed sites. B. gracilis cover was significantly auto-correlated in seven of eight 60-yr ungrazed exclosures, four of six 8-yr exclosures, and only three of eight grazed sites. Autocorrelograms showed that B. gracilis cover in ungrazed sites was frequently and positively spatially correlated at lag distances less than 5 m. B. gracilis cover was rarely autocorrelated at any sampled lag distance in grazed sites. The greater spatial heterogeneity in ungrazed sites appeared linked to patches characterized by uniformly low cover of B. gracilis and high cover of C3 grasses. This interpretation was supported by simple simulations that modified data from grazed sites by reducing the cover of B. gracilis in patches of ca. 8 m diameter and produced patterns quite similar to those observed in ungrazed sites. In the one exclosure where we intensively sampled soil texture, autocorrelation coefficients for sand content and B. gracilis cover were similar at lag distances up to 12 m. We suggest that the negative effect of sand content on B. gracilis generates spatial heterogeneity, but only in the absence of grazing. An additional source of heterogeneity in ungrazed sites may be the negative interaction between livestock exclusion and B. gracilis recovery following patchy disturbance."	53	3	0	0	46	0	64	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Recently established forests are commonly characterized by an impoverished understorey. Restoration is mostly based on spontaneous secondary succession, but little is known about the time period needed to achieve a community species pool with species composition equal to that of ancient forests. Vegetation in transects of 197 plots in 13 recent forest stands contiguous to the Meerdaalwoud ancient forest complex was surveyed. The recent forest stands ranged in age from 36 to 132 yr. The community species pool was described with an ecological, functional and phytosociological approach and based on groups derived from a CCA. Differences in community species pool between age classes of recent forest stands were analysed. During establishment of a new forest competitive species, forest edge species and species with high Ellenberg values for light and nitrogen and a more persistent seed bank will dominate the understorey. After 90 yr of succession the cover by these species decreases and reaches equal values to ancient forest after ca. 105 yr. A large number of forest species will be able to colonize the forest in less than 90 yr. Some typical forest species, however, have very low colonization rates and still have low cover in recent forest more than 105 yr old, so that complete restoration of the understorey requires a time period of over a century. Anthropogenic introduction of forest plant species may reduce the time required for ancient forest vegetation equality."	52	0	0	0	31	0	53	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200006	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, our current understanding of the Patagonian drylands has primarily been derived from comparing exclosures with grazing conditions or from single-site grazing gradients. The pending question is: do impacts of grazing intensification on Patagonian plant communities change along aridity gradients?LocationPatagonia, Argentina.MethodsWe surveyed vegetation cover of perennial species in paddocks with different sheep-grazing pressure (ungrazed, lightly, moderately, and intensively grazed, based on long-term stocking rates), in three plant communities located along a regional aridity gradient: a semi-desert (arid), a shrub-grass steppe (semi-arid), and a grass steppe (dry sub-humid). In these communities, we analyzed the effects of grazing pressure on the total cover of vegetation, the cover of dominant plant life-forms (grasses and shrubs), the plant species diversity, and the traits of dominant plant species.ResultsIntensification of sheep grazing significantly decreased total vegetation cover in the semi-desert, but not in the steppes. Although grazing decreased the cover of grasses (particularly of the highly preferred ones) in all communities, in the shrub-grass and grass steppes this reduction was offset by an increase in the cover and size of shrubs. Plant diversity was not consistently affected by grazing pressure in these communities. Traits of dominant plant species partially explained community responses to grazing intensification.ConclusionsLivestock grazing intensification reduces the forage quantity and quality of Patagonian plant communities, but the severity depends on plant community types. In semi-deserts (the most arid), grasses were drastically affected, while in the steppes, the grazing effects on grasses were low and partially compensated by an increase in the cover and size of shrubs, which fulfill critical roles other than forage provision. It is fundamental that grazing pressure be adapted to forage resource availability for each community type to achieve sustainable management in the context of climate change.We studied the impacts of intensifying livestock grazing on Patagonian plant communities across an aridity gradient. Grazing intensification reduced both the quantity and quality of forage within all plant communities, but the severity of the impacts increased with increasing aridity. Management of grazing pressure should be adapted to each community type to achieve sustainable management in the context of climate change.image"	9	0	0	0	7	0	9	2023-12-17	WOS:001108970400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, vegetation patch dynamics, that is, how patches of grazing-defended tall vegetation and grazer-preferred short lawns shift over space and time, is poorly understood. Here, we describe a new conceptual framework for patch dynamics within rangelands, combining theories of classical cyclical succession, self-organization and multitrophic feedbacks between grazers, vegetation and bioturbating soil fauna.Location: We use the cattle-grazed salt marsh of the island Schiermonnikoog, The Netherlands, as a model system. The grazed salt marsh is characterized by distinct tall vegetation patches dominated by the grazing-defended rush Juncus maritimus and grazing-intolerant grass Elytrigia atherica, surrounded by a matrix of grazing lawn (dominated by Festuca rubra).The Framework: Based on previous observational and experimental studies, we propose a cyclical patch dynamic where plant species composition and structure transitions through four phases: patch initiation (a) occurs when the grazing-defended rush J. maritimus establishes in the grazed lawn. Patch establishment (b) follows when the grazing-intolerant grass E. atherica establishes in the patch due to associational defence by J. maritimus and produces a large amount of litter that attracts the key bioturbating amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. Patch expansion (c) occurs when O. gammarellus activities improve soil properties of the patch, which favours E. atherica growth, leading to E. atherica competitively displacing J. maritimus in the centre of the patch. Patch degeneration (d) follows when cattle enter the enlarged patch to consume E. atherica in the centre, trample the soil, displace O. gammarellus and decrease vegetation cover, opening space for grazing-lawn species to invade. The cycle restarts when remnants of the rush J. maritimus in the degenerated patches (or individuals recently established from seed dispersal) initiate new patches in the grazing lawn.Synthesis: Our proposed patch-dynamic model provides a means to describe the mechanisms driving vegetation patch dynamics and serves as a foundation for further experimental and observational exploration, not only for this specific system, but more generally for grazed systems worldwide that show patches of typical grazing-defended and grazer-preferred vegetation."	3	0	0	0	1	0	3	2024-02-04	WOS:001138628700002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

This study was undertaken on a floodplain meadow to assess spatial patterns of plant communities in relation to soil physical and chemical conditions, and the impacts of floodplain restoration that involved embankment-removal. Location: River Glaven, Hunworth, Norfolk, UK. Methods: Fine-scale plant and soil chemistry sampling was conducted prior to embankment removal, and hydrological and climatological conditions were monitored prior to and after embankment removal. Hydrological/hydraulic modelling simulated groundwater levels for a 10-year period to assess changes in soil aeration stresses and plant community composition following embankment-removal. Results: Hydrology was identified as the primary driver of plant community composition. Soil fertility was also important. Unique continuous measurements of vadose dissolved oxygen concentrations using oxygen optodes indicated strong coupling between water table depth and root zone dissolved oxygen concentrations. Reinstatement of overbank flows did not substantially affect aeration stress across most of the meadow because of pre-existing wet conditions. However, along the river-floodplain ecotone, aeration stress increased substantially from conditions normally associated with dry grassland to those characteristic of fen communities (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This restored water table regime may be suitable for more diverse plant assemblages. Benefits of flooding for increased species richness and transport of propagules may, however, be over-ridden without accompanying water level management during the growing season, or hay removal to balance additional supply of nutrients from river floodwater and sediment. Our results show that hydrological/hydraulic modelling combined with quantitative measures of plant water-requirements can provide practical and adaptive management tools to estimate the response of floodplain communities to changing water regimes."	2	0	0	0	1	0	3	2023-01-06	WOS:000901929400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Conversely, government policies focus on excessive numbers of this small mammalian herbivore as the primary top-down cause of degradation in Tibetan rangeland. Despite concerted campaigns to reduce pika abundance in recent decades, the sustainability of Tibetan rangelands remains uncertain. Location Alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. Methods We proposed a conceptual model based on indigenous knowledge that predicted pika numbers from soil condition and plant traits. At three alpine meadow sites lightly grazed by livestock, we tested whether spatial variation in pika burrow density could be explained by changes in the functional composition of the plant community attributable to species turnover and intraspecific trait variation associated with changes in soil fertility. Results Due primarily to intraspecific trait variation, changes in the functional composition of the meadow community accounted for 56%-68% of the spatial variation in pika density, changes in the proportion of plant functional groups for 62%-74%, and changes in edaphic conditions for 71%-82%. Greater pika density was associated with a decline in soil phosphorus availability and a lower-growing vegetation profile enriched in both the quantity and quality of forage preferred by pikas. Conclusions These results, which are in accord with indigenous knowledge, suggest that compensating soil phosphorus losses and maintaining a well-calibrated grazing rotation can better manage pika populations and improve the sustainability of Tibetan rangelands. By combining trait-based ecology and traditional knowledge, our study provides new insight into both understanding the dynamic complexity of grazing regimes and managing rangeland sustainability."	6	2	0	0	2	0	8	2022-11-13	WOS:000878063800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Methods We resurveyed the plant communities of the mine 31 years after an initial survey. Changes in the prevalence of exotic species and species indicator values for environmental conditions were used to link the observed vegetation changes to global change factors. Results The plant communities, including their unmined reference sites, changed over the 31-year period toward plant communities with higher proportions of exotics, nitrophilous, warmth- and moisture-indicating species, and species of low foraging quality for deer. The changes are consistent with the novel drivers of community assembly at the site, such as the introduction of exotic species, increased nitrogen deposition, elevated temperatures, steadily increasing groundwater level post mining, and the massive comeback of red deer. Conclusions The global-change forcing of novel plant communities suggests that it is becoming increasingly difficult to restore historical references.

Transferable species were identified by vegetation survey and seed sample analyses. We analysed transfer rates and vegetation cover for the donor site species pool and Arrhenatherion target species, covering a 10-year observation period.

Although donor site species declined, the establishment of target species was satisfactory and species-rich grassland was successfully established, despite different site conditions between donor and receptor sites and strong dynamics in species composition over time. Conclusions Both harvesting methods are well suited for restoring species-rich grassland, and the actual choice ultimately depends on the costs and the given circumstances.

Severe peatland wildfires can provide opportunities for new non-peatland species to colonise post fire. Changes in plant colonisation could lead to longer-term shifts in community composition, compromising recovery of peatland structure and function. Understanding the process of post-fire recovery can thus inform restoration action and help restore peatland vascular plant communities. In this study, we ask: what drives initial vascular plant recovery following a peatland wildfire? Location Stalybridge moors, England (commonly referred to as the Saddleworth moors). Methods We used a series of vegetation surveys and seed germination experiments to identify the composition of vascular plant community one-year post fire, along with potential propagule sources. We combined this with plant trait data and, using a series of null models, compared observed community trait values against random species assemblages. Results Our data suggests that plant species are able to arrive at the burned site through multiple non-exclusive recolonisation pathways. This includes colonisation through the soil seed bank, along with dispersal from surrounding unburned peatland and non-peatland vegetation. The composition and structure of the recolonised communities was largely determined by the ability of species to reach the post-fire site from these donor communities. This resulted in a post-fire community composed of species possessing lower seed masses relative to the wider pool of potential colonisers. Conclusions Our results highlight propagule availability as a driver of post-wildfire vascular plant recovery. This provides opportunities for new non-peatland species to colonise, potentially driving changes in the direction of vegetation recovery. Ensuring the availability of peatland species following a wildfire could therefore be key to the immediate recovery of these systems."	10	0	0	0	7	0	12	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900014	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Which species were particularly affected? Are there non-random shifts in species composition? Were typical shade-tolerant forest species also jeopardized due to prolonged deep shade? Location Four recently installed strict reserves in Atlantic to Sub-Atlantic lowland oak and beech forests on fertile loess soils east and southwest of Brussels (Belgium). Methods We compared vegetation releves in permanent plots (183 plots of 16 m x 16 m) with a 10-year interval. Total species richness per site was derived from rarefaction curves; significance of differences in species richness and composition at plot level were tested using paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests.

We asked: with distance from trails, what are the effects of ATV use on (a) total, native, and non-native plant species richness and (b) presence and cover of the dune-stabilising plant Ammophila breviligulata? Specifically, how do (a) and (b) differ (1) between regions with and without ATV use; (2) with deeper ruts and increased distance from the ATV trail; and (3) between pioneer and shrub zones of dunes in each region?Location Miscou Island and Kouchibouguac National Park, New Brunswick, Canada.Methods We assessed ATV effects by conducting field vegetation surveys in a region with (Miscou Island) and without (Kouchibouguac National Park) ATV use. Line transects were used to capture gradients of effects across the dune community via plots evenly placed to measure trail effects (on the trail), close-edge effects (edge of the trail), and distant-edge effects (every 5 m up to 25 m away from trail), in pioneer and shrub zones of dunes.Results All-terrain vehicle rut depth was associated with a decrease in total and native species on the trails and on the edge of trails, and with a slight increase in non-native species beyond the trail edge. We also found a rut depth threshold of approximately 50 cm, beyond which was an abrupt decline across all species. Where ATV activity occurred, there was also a decrease of A. breviligulata in presence and cover, non-native species increased in the pioneer zone, and the shrub zone had fewer native species.Conclusions All-terrain vehicle use plays a major role in the vegetation changes observed on coastal dunes. A management plan that recognises the specific effects caused by ATV use on dune vegetation will help preserve dunes, enabling more cost-effective coastal protection than engineered interventions."	6	0	0	0	4	0	10	2020-12-24	WOS:000597761800001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, little is known about the time required for the recovery of grassland functionality, i.e., for the recovery of reproductive and vegetative processes typical of pristine grasslands. Since these processes operate at different scales, we addressed the question: do reproductive and vegetative processes require different recovery times during spontaneous succession? Location Kiskunsag sand region (Central Hungary). Methods As combinations of plant traits can be used to highlight general patterns in ecological processes, we compared reproductive (pollination- and dispersal-related) and vegetative (growth form) traits between recovered grasslands of different age (<10 years old; 10-20 years old; 20-40 years old) and pristine grasslands. Results During spontaneous succession, the reproductive trait spectra became similar to those of pristine grasslands earlier than the vegetative ones. In arable land abandoned for 10 years, pollination- and dispersal-related trait spectra did not show significant difference to those of pristine grasslands; anemophily and anemochory were the prevailing strategies. Contrarily, significant differences in the growth form spectrum could be observed even after 40 years of abandonment; in recovered grasslands erect leafy species prevailed, while the fraction of dwarf shrubs and tussock-forming species was significantly lower than in pristine grasslands. Conclusions The recovery of the ecological processes of pristine grasslands might require different amounts of time, depending on the spatial scale at which they operate. The reproductive trait spectra recovered earlier than the vegetative one, since reproductive attributes first determine plant species sorting at the regional level towards their respective habitats. The recovery of the vegetative trait spectrum needs more time as vegetative-based interactions operate on a smaller spatial scale. Thus, vegetative traits might be more effective in the long-term assessment of restoration success than the reproductive ones."	4	0	0	0	6	0	6	2019-07-12	WOS:000473236900007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The largest is the flat Yamdena (7 degrees 36S, 131 degrees 25E).MethodsVegetation was interpreted from LANDSAT satellite data, overlaid with geology and topography for pre-stratification. Within each strata, forest sites were equally systematically sampled using a network of small 0.2ha survey plots (60 plots, 7,130 trees) and soil pits sampled for 44 of the vegetation plots. Fisher's alpha diversity index was used together with ordination techniques to assert differences in forest types.ResultsThe forest covered c. 70% of the island, comprising seasonal evergreen forest (SEF), dry deciduous forest (DDF) and moist deciduous forest' (MDF). The SEF canopy (Burseraceae, Meliaceae, Oleaceae and Dilleniaceae) sited around 35m. The density of trees above 10cm diameter averaged 632 individuals/ha, the basal area (BA) was 32m(2)/ha, and species diversity (SD, Fischer ) 14.84. Rattans are abundant in the understorey. The MDF exhibited a mixture of evergreen and deciduous big trees while the lower storey was evergreen. Rattans were less common. Distinct family species associations emerged from the ordination (Combretaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae and Apocynaceae or Meliaceae, Gnetaceae, Clusiaceae). The density of trees averaged 491 individuals/ha, BA 26m(2)/ha and SD 18.73. The canopy of the DDF (Ebenaceae, Fabaceae, Apocynaceae and Menispermaceae) was around 30m. During the dry season all tree species shed their leaves. The density of trees averaged 552 individuals/ha, BA 20m(2)/ha and SD 11.58.ConclusionsThe last natural seasonal forests of Indonesia are nowadays only found in the Tanimbar Archipelago. The existence of three contrasted seasonal forest types on small flat island was remarkable and should be quickly translated into decision making for land zoning, agriculture or forestry development, avoiding approaches applied in the humid region of the country. To succeed however, the ecology of these seasonal forests should quickly become priority areas for research to feed the design of suitable conservation and management strategies."	10	0	0	0	8	0	11	2018-09-04	WOS:000442660900011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Most historical plots, however, are not permanentlymarked and uncertainty in plot location, in addition to observer bias and seasonal bias, may add significant errors to temporal change. These errorsmay havemajor implications for the reliability of studies on long- term environmental change and deserve closer attention of vegetation ecologists. Methods: Vegetation data obtained from the resurveying of non-permanently marked plots are assessed for their potential to study environmental change effects on plant communities and the challenges the use of such data have to meet. We describe the properties of vegetation resurveys, distinguishing basic types of plots according to relocation error, and we highlight the potential of such data types for studying vegetation dynamics and their drivers. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of resurveying non-permanently marked vegetation plots for different purposes in environmental change research. Results and conclusions: Re-sampling error is caused by three main independent sources of error: error caused by plot relocation, observer bias and seasonality bias. For relocation error, vegetation plots can be divided into permanent and non-permanent plots, while the latter are further divided into quasi-permanent (with approximate relocation) and non-traceable (with random relocation within a sampled area) plots. To reduce the inherent sources of error in resurvey data, the following precautions should be followed: (i) resurvey historical vegetation plots whose approximate plot location within a study area is known; (ii) consider all information available from historical studies in order to keep plot relocation errors low; (iii) resurvey at times of the year when vegetation development is comparable to the historical survey to control for seasonal variability in vegetation; (iv) retain a high level of experience of the observers to keep observer bias low; and (v) edit and standardize data sets before analyses."	178	1	0	0	147	0	185	2017-04-01	WOS:000398083700002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Beyond the effect of fertilizer quantity (total and available N supply), is there a specific effect of fertilizer quality (the various N sources) on the multiple biodiversity facets of plant communities?Location: Jura Mountains (France).Methods: Based on a vegetation and agronomic survey of 29 mown grasslands, we considered taxonomic, phylogenetic and multi-trait functional diversity indices as well as community-weighted means of seven functional traits (CWMs) including CSR strategies. Using partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) and Spearman correlations, we assessed the response of these biodiversity metrics to (1) the medium-term total N input and the short-term available N input of any origin, and (2) the relative contribution of industrial fertilizers, solid manure, liquid manure, livestock restitutions and atmospheric deposition to the amount of available N added to the soil during the year preceding vegetation sampling.Results: We report significant negative rank correlations between total or available N input and two diversity metrics: species richness and functional richness. Among CWMs, high N inputs were positively correlated with specific leaf area (SLA), competitive and ruderal strategies, and negatively with seed mass and stress-tolerant strategy. Results also revealed various trends according to the N source: when the proportion of available N from livestock restitutions was high, plant communities showed higher taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and lower leaf dry matter content. In contrast, communities receiving mainly industrial fertilizers showed lower taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and higher SLA. Moreover, pRDA suggested contrasting impacts of the main N source on life strategies: R strategy appeared more favoured by a high proportion of industrial fertilizers, while C strategy was enhanced by liquid or solid manure.Conclusions: Our observations support the common finding that a high N supply impacts plant functional composition and is associated with a decrease in species richness through the loss of stress-tolerant species. In addition, they show that biodiversity patterns mostly depend on fertilizer origin. In particular, industrial fertilizers appear to be the most detrimental sources of nutrients for both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity in mountain grasslands."	8	0	0	0	8	0	9	2016-04-01	WOS:000374545600005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Does distance to intact remnant grassland (IRG) patches affect restoration success, and does the effect of inoculum addition depend on distance to IRGs?Location: Meerdaal forest, Oud-Heverlee, Belgium.Methods: In a topsoil-removed site of 8.5 ha, where 24 IRG patches (ca. 10% of the area) were kept, 48 plots (1 m(2)) were established at three distances (5, 10 and 20 m) from the edge of IRG patches. Half of the plots at each distance class were inoculated with a custom-made AMF inoculum, whereas the remaining plots were used as controls. We recorded plant species abundance in the plots, just before addition of the AMF inoculum and 1 yr after. We used repeated measures ANOVA to test for effects of inoculum addition, distance to IRG patches and their interaction on plant species richness, diversity and plant community similarity between IRG patches and plots. We also evaluated the response of AMF-dependent plant species, specialist species of NPG and species with specific seed dispersal adaptations.Results: Adding the inoculum positively affected species richness and/or diversity of all plant species, AMF-dependent species and specialist species. It increased plant community similarity to the IRG patches. Increasing distance from IRG patches had a negative effect on richness and/or diversity of all plant species and specialist species. The positive effect of inoculum addition on richness and/or diversity of all species, AMF-dependent species and specialist species decreased with increasing distance from IRG patches to the plots, likely indicating priority effects.Conclusions: The application of a custom-made AMF inoculum increased the short-term restoration success of NPG after topsoil removal. Dispersal limitation of specialist plant species of NPG, however, likely negatively affected the effect of inoculum addition. Apart from the AMF effect, the reported strongly positive short-time effect of inoculation was likely due to the high density of IRG patches at the site, and the presence of organic matter and other micro-organisms in the inoculum."	36	1	0	0	31	0	38	2016-01-01	WOS:000368074600004	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To improve the basis for managing these key ecosystems, we selected a Tertiary relict woodland (Argania spinosa) in order to clarify the sensitivity to long-term climate change (the present, the past glacial-interglacial cycle and under future scenarios). We also discuss the impact of long-term human land use for the distribution of dry woodlands in North Africa.Location: North Africa,Methods: To assess whether the argan woodland is in equilibrium with current climate, we used species distribution modelling (SUM) to estimate its potential range. Then, SDM was used to estimate its potential distribution during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21,000 BP) and the Middle Holocene (Mid-Holocene; 6,000 BP). Model predictions for past scenarios were compared with Quaternary palaeorecords to evaluate their accuracy. Finally, we forecasted changes in the potential range to year 2080 to assess its likely future range dynamics.Results: At the LGM, suitable areas occurred at more southern latitudes, where the Sahara Desert currently lies, while suitable areas in the Mid-Holocene shifted northwards, occupying areas similar to those of today. The estimated past distributions are consistent with palaeorecords, providing evidence for the important role of Quaternary climate changes in driving dry woodland range dynami.cs. The current range-filling constitutes 44% of the potential distribution, probably primarily reflecting anthropic land-use effects. Future climate change is forecast not to cause latitudinal/altitudinal range shifts, but rather an overall range contraction.Conclusions: The models reflect the high sensitivity of the dry woodland ecosystem to past climate changes, in agreement with palaeorecords. The estimated climatic sensitivity also predicts severe range contraction during future climate change. Consequently, management strategies for dry woodlands should be developed to facilitate their in situ survival, particularly by reducing the currently intensive human pressure."	22	0	0	0	14	0	24	2015-04-01	WOS:000352131500013	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We hypothesized that management practices are as important as the timing of the operations themselves, with respect to diversity and species composition of the understorey post-fire regenerated Pious halepensis forests.Location: Two post-fire regenerated P. halepensis stands burned in 1994 under contrasting climatic conditions (Dry -595 mm.yr(-1)- and Semi-arid - 340 mm.yr(-1) - sites) in southeast Spain.Methods: At both sites, we set experimental plots to test early treatments, including removal of the understorey vegetation (scrubbing, at post-fire year 5), thinning (at post-fire years 5 and 10) and control plots. Alpha diversity indices, including species richness, Shannon diversity index and plant cover, as a measure of vegetation abundance, and beta diversity indices, such as Jaccard index and non-metric multidimensional scaling were diachronically analysed at post-fire years 5 (before the treatments) and 16.Results: At both sites, the most abundant species were obligate seeders or grass resprouters. Low overlap in the occurrence of species was also found between sites on both dates, but the number of shared species increased by the end of the study period. Significant differences in the diversity indices were detected between sites. Despite the silvicultural treatments, the species richness and Shannon diversity index values at the Dry site were similar in the treated and control plots at 16 yr. Conversely, at the Semi-arid site, the species richness and Sh.annon diversity index values were enhanced by the thinning treatments carried out 10 yr after the fire. Plant cover increased despite the treatments (scrubbing and thinning) on both the pine and understorey layers in every treated plot.Conclusion: Our forest management trials eshanced the diversity indices when applied to very high tree density post-fire regenerated stands, even applied to areas with very limited resources (nutrients, water, such as semi-arid ecosystems. Thus, scrubbing at post-fire year 5 plus thinning carried out at post-fire year 10 proved to be a suitable option to reduce fire hazards in the short term at both sites and to enhance plant diversity at the Semi-arid site."	11	0	0	0	4	0	11	2015-04-29	WOS:000352131500012	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

(iii) Are these species dominant or subordinate components in mature target communities? (iv) Do native or alien species have stronger effects on the diversity and progress of succession?LocationAbandoned agricultural fields (abandoned croplands, orchards and vineyards) at various locations throughout Hungary.MethodsVegetation patterns on 112 old-fields, in 25 sites varying in soil and climatic conditions, topography, landscape contexts and land-use histories were sampled. Most old-fields had appropriate seed sources in the immediate vicinity, i.e. natural or semi-natural grasslands (meadows steppes, closed and open sand steppes) as source and target habitats. Age of abandoned fields ranged from 1 to 69yr, but most sites were between 15 and 60yr. The cover of vascular plant species (%) was estimated in 2x2-m plots. Relationships between diversity, progress of succession (similarity to target communities) and identity of dominants were tested.ResultsA small portion of successional dominants (eight species) had strong negative impacts on diversity. These species belonged to Poaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae. Most of these species were wind-pollinated, and capable of lateral vegetative spread. Dominant species varied in size and had, on average, a low requirement for N but a high requirement for light. With one exception, Solidago gigantea, they were native to the Hungarian flora. Significant differences were found among the impact of successional dominants when dominant species were grouped according to their original role (dominants or subordinates) in natural communities. The overall effect of species identity was also significant. Bothriochloa ischaemum was identified as the species with the strongest negative effect on species diversity.ConclusionsOur results suggest that mid-successional dominant species differ in their impact on diversity and progress of succession. Mid-successional plots dominated by alien species, or by native species that were originally subordinate in natural communities, regenerate less successfully and may temporarily arrest succession. Therefore, early colonization of native dominants should be enhanced with restoration measures."	61	0	0	0	51	0	71	2014-04-01	WOS:000332774800003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How many years are required for plant species composition of re-vegetated cutover peatlands to resemble natural boreal bogs? Location Newly formed Sphagnum carpets on restored, cutover peatlands (in Canada) or re-vegetated spontaneously after site abandonment (in Estonia) and on undisturbed natural bogs nearby. Methods Plant frequencies (point intercept method) and abundances (vegetation quadrats) were assessed along linear transects. At each assessment point, moss surface height was measured relative to a local reference point (lowest point on a given transect) to associate frequencies or abundances to a position in the gradient of microtopography. PCAs (separately for Canada and Estonia) were conducted to follow evolution of plant species frequency in the gradient of microtopography in re-vegetated sites and similarity with those of natural peatlands. In Canada, regressions were also performed to estimate relationships between moss surface height and vascular plant cover (ericaceous shrubs and Cyperaceae) as well as time required for vascular plant cover to become similar to that of natural bogs. Results Species composition was still dissimilar to microstructures of natural bogs 10 yr post-restoration and 70 yr post-abandonment; however, some trends were observed in re-vegetated peatlands. The greatest differences were for ericaceous species (two- to three-fold less abundant in re-vegetated peatlands), dominant Cyperaceae, and relative proportions of Sphagnum. In addition, hummock formation was closely related to dense (>50%) ericaceous cover. Conclusions All species tolerant to abiotic conditions prevailing in re-vegetated sites contributed to initiation of microtopography, although some species were found in atypical positions within the gradient of microtopography. Random events and establishment priority seemed initially to be more important in temporal evolution of microstructures than plant interactions. However, ecological restoration could effectively reduced time needed for species occurrences to approach those in natural peatlands, relative to time required for recovery of spontaneously re-vegetated peat extraction sites."	37	0	0	0	33	0	41	2012-07-25	WOS:000305936800008	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Future potential species distribution, richness, local colonization, local extinction and species turnover were modelled according to two scenarios (A2 and B1) for 2050 and 2080.Results: Robust Random Forest proved to be the best statistical model to predict the potential distribution of tree species abundance. Climate change could lead to a shift in tree species distribution towards higher altitudes and a reduction of forest cover. Pinus sylvestris and Tilia cordata may be considered at risk of local extinction, while the other species could find potential suitable areas at the cost of a rearrangement of forest community composition and increasing competition.Conclusions: Geographical and topographical regional characteristics can have a noticeable influence on the impact of predicted climate change on forest ecosystems within the Mediterranean basin.

To test this hypothesis, detailed vegetation surveys were carried out in 62 study plots located in four relatively undisturbed forest fragments situated at altitudes between 1600 m and 2300 m. Floristic diversity was evaluated using a combination of multivariate statistical analyses and diversity indices.ResultsOrdination and indicator species analyses showed gradual variations in floristic diversity along the altitudinal gradient with a pronounced shift in species composition at ca. 1830 m. Upper montane forest (> 1830 m) is characterized by high fern diversity and indicator species that are Afromontane endemics. Lower montane forest (< 1830 m) exhibits a greater diversity of tree species and a higher abundance of the flagship species Coffea arabica.ConclusionsOur results provide crucial ecological background information concerning the montane rainforests of Ethiopia, which have been poorly studied until now. We conclude that both forest types identified during this study need to be considered for conservation because of their particular species compositions.

The age of the site, nutrient levels, and presence of standing water and bare rock were important factors influencing species composition in both habitats.Conclusions: Through natural revegetation alone, the abandoned quarry floors surveyed in this study have already taken on many physical and vegetation characteristics of natural alvars. This makes alvars very suitable as the restoration goal for abandoned limestone quarries."	25	1	0	0	23	0	31	2008-02-01	WOS:000252958300009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

If so, does it mean that baboons are major dispersal agents and that plants established under these trees are important foci of Opuntia stricta spread?Location: Skukuza, Kruger National Park, South Africa.Method: We surveyed an area invaded by Opuntia stricta in the Skukuza region of KNP. The survey included plots under potential baboon roosting trees, plots under trees unlikely to support baboons. and paired randomly located open sites.Results: The null hypothesis - tree-Opuntia spatial independence - can be rejected for Acacia nilotica, but not for Spirostachys africana. Opuntia plants are positively associated with Acacia trees suitable for baboon roosting. However, there is no significant difference between frequency of Opuntia under Acacia trees suitable and unsuitable for baboon roosting. It appears that all Acacia trees can serve as nurse trees for Opuntia. Compared to plots under Acacia trees, frequencies of old and robust Opuntia plants are significantly higher in open areas and under dead trees.Conclusions: While baboons may be responsible for long distance Opuntia dispersal (over km), their role is not detectable at a local scale. On the other hand, elephants seem to contribute substantially to the local vegetative propagation of this species.

The above-ground vegetation in the study area 1, 2 and 3 yr after restoration was compared to (1) the vegetation present during the previous 5-yr fallow stage and (2) target flood-plain meadows. Before restoration, the above-ground fallow vegetation was dominated by ruderal and annual species, while only very few meadow species were present. Sowing led to tall, dense vegetation, mainly dominated by the sown species. Ruderal and annual species had decreased 3 yr after restoration, but target species were still poorly represented. Species richness was significantly lower in the sown site than in the semi-natural target meadows and the vegetation had a different composition. Analysis of the soil seed bank of the restored meadow showed that only a few meadow species were present and that it was dominated by a few ruderal species.

The enclosure contained four different plant communities. Eutrophic pastures on deep soil were largely overturned, but recolonization was quick and vegetation dominated by the original species. Mesotrophic pastures were less damaged on stony soil but were completely destroyed on deep soil, recovery was slow and was characterized by a shift of plant species in a more eutrophic direction. Four years were not sufficient for complete recovery. Oligotrophic calcareous pastures on shallow stony soil were not damaged.

Spatial heterogeneity of light distribution was greater at all scales in the native, annually disturbed grassland than in the two non-disturbed grasslands. The disturbance regime affected temporal dynamics of the spatial patterns of light distribution in each grassland. The annually disturbed grassland exhibited a dramatic decrease in lacunarity (heterogeneity) from early to late April, likely the result of considerable growth of a cool-season grass. A general decrease in lacunarity occurred in the native, non-disturbed grassland, although the magnitude was much less than in the annually disturbed grassland. The reverted, non-disturbed grassland did not exhibit an appreciable change in lacunarity until later in the growing season, and then only at smaller scales.

This paper describes the vegetation change in an 18-year experiment designed to test a range of control of Pteridium aquilinum (Pteridium) and heathland restoration treatments; cutting, asulam application and Calluna vulgar is seeding, in a range of combinations at Cavenham Heath in Breckland, UK between 1978 and 1996. Vegetation change was recorded in two Phases; in Phase I (1978-1986) species biomass was sampled and in Phase II (1986-1996) cover was measured. Initially, Calluna establishment was good in some treatments, especially where Calluna seed was added and Pteridium was controlled. Other plots developed either a grass-heath flora dominated by Agrostis capillaris, Deschampsia flexuosa, Dicranum scoparium, Festuca ovina and Rumex acetosella or were dominated by clonal species such as Calamagrostis epigejos or Carex arenaria. An unconstrained ordination showed significant vegetation change through time and that several treatments influenced the vegetation, especially those involving asulam application. When variation partitioning with constrained ordination was used a different explanation emerged. In Phase I the most important factors were the management treatments applied, elapsed time and spatial factors, with little overlap. In Phase II, elapsed time became irrelevant because the variation time explained overlapped that which could be explained by other variables. The most important of these were management treatments, spatial effects, weather, the amount of bare ground caused by disturbance and Pteridium litter cover (an index of Pteridium recovery). The implications of these results in interpreting vegetation change are discussed."	13	1	0	0	9	0	16	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

It is remarkable that after many thousands of years of pastoralism in arid and semi-arid savannas, there is still no clear answer to the basic question: Does livestock grazing have more than a marginal effect on the dynamics of arid and semi-arid land vegetation? A small study of semi-arid savanna vegetation along a spatial gradient in grazing pressure, repeated three times over 19 years is used as a basis for discussing the behaviour of dry land vegetation under heavy grazing. Three basic theories are compared: (1) the theory that heavy grazing causes desertification; (2) the theory that heavy grazing causes no directed change in the vegetation of arid and semi-arid rangelands; and (3) the theory that heavy grazing leads to a switch between alternative states of vegetation. On the basis of the current data the first two theories are rejected, but the conclusion is that there is much evidence for a more complex behaviour of dry rangelands under grazing than what is accommodated in any of the three theories. Probably, site-specific properties including interactive and indirect effects of herbivory in the system are important for vegetation development under grazing in arid and semi-arid rangelands."	22	0	0	0	12	1	24	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Eleven years of abandonment of a species-rich fen-meadow under undisturbed environmental conditions resulted in transformation into areas with tall herb-, sedge- and rush-dominated communities and areas with Alnus thicket. Species cover was measured in permanent plots in both community types and succession was monitored during 14 yr of restoration following reintroduction of management. The annual increase in accumulated species number followed a log-log-time linear regression during 10 yr of grazing management. The expected number of years taken before this annual rate was equal to annual extinction, i.e. a stable situation according to species density, was up to six. The response of 64 species to management was evaluated through paired statistical tests of changes in cover and frequency over time. In total, 55 species could each be allocated to one unique response model (monotone or non-monotone, concave models) independently of the importance value used (cover or frequency) and type of management (grazing following felling or mowing and mowing without grazing). Species which increased in response to grazing had the most persistent seed banks and CR-strategies, while species decreasing in response to grazing had less persistent seed banks and CS-strategies. Some of the species which increased due to grazing followed a model with a local maximum in cover and frequency. The results are discussed in relation to management of species with high cover value during restoration succession."	23	1	0	0	17	0	28	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In an experiment in a limestone grassland on the Baltic island of Oland, SE Sweden, nutrient and water supply, light intensity and grazing regime were altered in 10 combinations during four years in 10 plots of 0.25 m2 with subplots of 0.01 m2 and 0.0004 m2. Only the combined application of fertilizer and shade led to a strong decrease in average species richness (S1) at all scales. When comparing species numbers summed up over all 10 replicates of each treatment (Sn) at the three quadrat sizes, differences in effect of these treatments were much smaller, and were so already at the finest scale. a-diversity, measured as (Sn - S1 was quite constant over different scales for most treatments, i.e. diversity did not increase with an increase in scale. The richness ratioSn/S1 decreased with increasing scale, indicating an increasing degree of homogeneity at larger scales. Treatments which only included fertilizer or shade, maintained high species richness; this high richness was also maintained in combination with grazing and could then be explained by the denser packing of vegetation. Patterns of species richness were correlated at the large scale, but not at the finer scales, indicating a high degree of spatial and temporal heterogeneity at the finer scales. With increasing quadrat size species persistence increased which explains the small effect of certain treatments. Clearly, a range of scales has to be sampled in this type of vegetation to be able to measure different patterns, which may occur under different experimental treatments. The finest scale in this study can become too small, when certain treatments result in a coarse-grained vegetation pattern. The quadrat size of 10 cm x 10 cm should be included in the range of scales. It combines accuracy in sampling with efficiency in time effort, a reasonably large number of species sampled, and a strong differentiation in the effects of the various treatments."	6	0	0	0	4	0	7	1999-12-01	WOS:000208472100011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Biomass estimation methods were either field-based (i.e., rising plate meter, multispectral radiometer) or satellite-based (i.e., Landsat satellite imagery, AussieGRASS forage production model). Sampling occurred across open and wooded semi-arid vegetation types. We compared methods based on accuracy, the ability of each method to accurately predict a 'forage-switch' threshold, cost, and the suitability for the management context.ResultsFor this case study, the multispectral radiometer was the most precise, yet most expensive, biomass estimation method over a single survey. However, satellite imagery proved to be the most cost-efficient and fit for purpose, as it was inexpensive and most accurately estimated biomass around a forage-switch threshold, second only to the multispectral radiometer. Accuracy of all methods was improved by including tree cover in the regression models.ConclusionsWe demonstrate a process for exploring which biomass estimation tool might be preferred for a given decision context, highlighting accuracy, consideration of tolerance to uncertainty and risk, the spatial and temporal scale of information required, and budget constraints.We compared the performance, cost, and suitability of multiple field and satellite-based grass biomass estimation methods.

For this, we investigated the following questions: (i) does the initial composition of planted communities (distinct combination of ecological groups) affect the natural regeneration regarding functional composition (mean trait values), diversity (functional and taxonomic), and vegetation structure? (ii) Which functional traits of the planted community have the potential to promote or constrain natural regeneration?LocationThe study was carried out in the Poco das Antas Biological Reserve, located in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, in a stand of 2.16 hectares with an experimental restoration design established in the year 2000 to test tree species performance of different ecological groups.MethodsIn 2020, we sampled trees with a diameter at breast height greater than 2.5 cm in 20 m x 20 m plots with four replicates per treatment and measured leaf, wood, and seed functional traits. Then, we estimated the diversity (functional and taxonomic richness), functional composition, and vegetation structure of natural regeneration, compared them between treatments, and tested which traits of the planted community influenced them.ResultsNatural regeneration exhibited significant differences between treatments, particularly regarding the diversity dimension (functional and taxonomic) and vegetation structure (basal area and abundance). Wood density, leaf phosphorus content, and leaf C:N ratio of the planted species were associated with natural regeneration (functional composition, diversity, and vegetation structure).ConclusionsPriority effects in conservative tree planting communities affect natural regeneration, while functional convergence observed in acquisitive planting communities suggests the role of environmental filtering. Communities with low wood density, low C:N ratio, and high specific leaf area, which characterize an acquisitive resource-use strategy, exhibited higher functional and taxonomic diversity of natural regeneration, leading to the desired trajectory in ecological restoration.Our study investigated the community assembly in a 20-year-old Brazilian Atlantic Forest restoration area.

Minimizing such errors and finding alternative approaches for analyzing resurvey data are therefore important. We focused on inter-observer error and excluded other sources of variation. Our main questions were: How large is the inter-observer error (i.e. pseudoturnover) in vegetation surveys, and can it be reduced by simple data aggregation approaches? Which factors are affecting pseudoturnover and does it vary between morphological species groups or change over time? Is ecological inference robust against inter-observer differences? Location Switzerland. Methods Over seven years, we double-surveyed a total of 224 plots that were marked once in the field and then sampled by two observers independently on the same day. Both observers conducted full vegetation surveys, recording all vascular plant species, their cover, and additional plot information. We then calculated mean ecological indicator values and pseudoturnover. Results Average pseudoturnover was 29% when raw species lists were compared. However, by applying simple aggregation steps to the species list, pseudoturnover was reduced to 17%. Pseudoturnover further varied among habitat types and declined over the years, indicating a training effect among observers. Most overlooked taxa, responsible for pseudoturnover, had low cover values. Mean ecological indicator values were robust against inter-observer differences. Conclusions To minimize pseudoturnover, we suggest continuous training of observers and species-list aggregation prior to analysis. As mean ecological indicator values were robust against inter-observer differences, we conclude that they can provide a reliable estimate of temporal vegetation and ecological changes."	11	0	0	0	8	0	11	2022-07-22	WOS:000825393600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Can wild and free-ranging ungulates, such as red deer, contribute to the preservation of characteristic open habitat plant communities? Location Grafenwohr military training area, Germany. Methods We set up a grazing exclusion experiment in grasslands (lowland hay meadows) and heathlands (European dry heaths) and monitored structural vegetation characteristics (sward height, bare soil, biomass contribution ofCalluna vulgaris, litter height, woody species individuals) in open and fenced plots within a three-year study period. We compared plant species richness, diversity and community composition before and after the experimental period. Results In grasslands, plant species diversity was significantly reduced in fenced compared to open plots and in both habitat types, plant community composition responded to the exclusion of red deer. When fences prevented red deer grazing, increasing height of sward and litter in both habitat types as well as reduced cover of bare soil and increasing number of woody plant individuals in heathlands indicated beginning succession. In annually mown grasslands, where the regrowth provides attractive forage for red deer, the differences between open and fenced plots were most pronounced.

We aimed to provide land managers with general rules of thumb to assess when it is necessary to invest resources in active restoration, such as tree planting, to accelerate forest recovery.Location: Coto Brus County, Puntarenas, Costa Rica.Methods: We compiled data on initial vegetation structure, soil nutrients, prior land-use history and surrounding forest cover at 13 sites. After 8.5 years, we measured vegetation indicators commonly used to assess forest recovery, namely amount of canopy closure and number and diversity of woody recruits.Results: Two variables, grass cover and canopy closure, measured 1.5 years after site abandonment, explained 47-87% of five of the six response variables after 8.5 years; recovery was faster in sites with lower grass cover and higher canopy closure initially. Waiting an additional year to measure initial vegetation variables did not improve model fit. Time since the original forest was cleared explained 62% of change in canopy cover, whereas percentage of surrounding forest cover, length of pasture use and soil variables explained minimal additional variation.Conclusions: Our results suggest that two easily measurable vegetation variables can provide guidance to land managers and policy makers about where to invest scarce restoration resources to facilitate forest recovery."	35	0	0	0	32	0	38	2018-11-27	WOS:000450061000011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Species composition also varied between sites and sample years.ConclusionsWe found that livestock exclusion strongly affects plant species composition in fens, including promoting species with functional traits that indicate a loss of functioning condition, such as ruderal and upland species. Possible explanations for these observed shifts include: (1) biomass accumulation in the absence of herbivory, (2) competitive exclusion in fenced sites, (3) succession, (4) the abiotic conditions of our study sites, particularly hydrology and nutrient status, and (5) interactions among these factors. We conclude that degradation of fen wetlands caused by livestock grazing in the arid western US may not be reversed by excluding livestock alone."	12	1	0	0	9	0	14	2018-01-01	WOS:000425120600002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Differential organization of taxonomic and functional diversity in an urban woody plant metacommunity	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	20	1	NA	NA	7	17	NA	10.1111/avsc.12266	Article	JAN 2017	2017	"Questions: Urban ecosystems present an opportunity to study ecological communities in the context of unprecedented environmental change. In the face of urban land conversion, ecologists observe new patterns of species composition, dominance, behaviour and dispersal. We propose a hypothetical socioeconomic template that describes a gradient in human investment in community composition to aid in organizing the human role in shaping urban biodiversity. We asked: (1) what is the relative magnitude of taxonomic and functional turnover of urban woody plant communities across different land-use types; and (2) do land uses exhibiting higher intensity of human management of biodiversity support higher turnover over those with less human influence?Location: Baltimore, MD, USA (39 degrees 17' N, 76 degrees 38' W).Methods: We examined patterns in woody plant biodiversity across 209 plots of different urban land uses. Six land-use types were arranged along a gradient in the intensity through which humans are hypothesized to manage species composition at the plot scale. We calculated local, or alpha-diversity, and compositional turnover, or beta-diversity, of taxonomic and functional diversity across plots within each land-use type. We compared the magnitude of these biodiversity measures between land uses to test our conceptual template for how the intensity of human management can predict urban woody plant biodiversity.Results: We observed high taxonomic turnover in residential and commercial plots compared with vacant or open space land-use areas. This was associated with a weaker, but similar, pattern in functional diversity. This was associated with low total abundance in residential and commercial plots. Furthermore, the number of unique species was extremely high in the same land-use types.Conclusions: Our observations help explain why turnover can be high in heavily managed plots relative to vacant land. In patches without heavy human management, we found low levels of turnover. This highlights the importance of assessing diversity both locally and at the level of turnover between patches. Management and policy can benefit from the perspective embodied in the conceptual approach tested here."	27	3	0	0	27	0	32	2017-03-30	WOS:000396473500003	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

During the long history of syntaxonomy, many concepts and names of vegetation units have been proposed, but there has been no single classification system integrating these units. Here we (1) present a comprehensive, hierarchical, syntaxonomic system of alliances, orders and classes of Braun-Blanquet syntaxonomy for vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen, and algal communities of Europe; (2) briefly characterize in ecological and geographic terms accepted syntaxonomic concepts; (3) link available synonyms to these accepted concepts; and (4) provide a list of diagnostic species for all classes.LocationEuropean mainland, Greenland, Arctic archipelagos (including Iceland, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya), Canary Islands, Madeira, Azores, Caucasus, Cyprus.MethodsWe evaluated approximately 10000 bibliographic sources to create a comprehensive list of previously proposed syntaxonomic units. These units were evaluated by experts for their floristic and ecological distinctness, clarity of geographic distribution and compliance with the nomenclature code. Accepted units were compiled into three systems of classes, orders and alliances (EuroVegChecklist, EVC) for communities dominated by vascular plants (EVC1), bryophytes and lichens (EVC2) and algae (EVC3).ResultsEVC1 includes 109 classes, 300 orders and 1108 alliances; EVC2 includes 27 classes, 53 orders and 137 alliances, and EVC3 includes 13 classes, 24 orders and 53 alliances. In total 13448 taxa were assigned as indicator species to classes of EVC1, 2087 to classes of EVC2 and 368 to classes of EVC3. Accepted syntaxonomic concepts are summarized in a series of appendices, and detailed information on each is accessible through the software tool EuroVegBrowser.ConclusionsThis paper features the first comprehensive and critical account of European syntaxa and synthesizes more than 100yr of classification effort by European phytosociologists. It aims to document and stabilize the concepts and nomenclature of syntaxa for practical uses, such as calibration of habitat classification used by the European Union, standardization of terminology for environmental assessment, management and conservation of nature areas, landscape planning and education.

Creation of micro-topographic features: a new tool for introducing specialist species of calcareous grassland to restored sites?	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	19	1	NA	NA	89	100	NA	10.1111/avsc.12198	Article	JAN 2016	2016	"Questions: What types of pre-sowing disturbance are most suitable to establish specialist forbs of calcareous grassland at previously agriculturally improved restored sites? What impact does management regime have on post-establishment abundance-dynamics?Location: Pegsdon Hills, Bedfordshire, UK.Methods: We set up a 4-yr experiment using a split-plot design to combine pre-sowing disturbance treatments at sub-plot level (undisturbed control, glyphosate spraying, harrowing, and creation of ridge-and-furrow features) with three post-establishment management regimes applied at main plot level in years 2-4, involving either summer cutting or summer cattle grazing, and presence or absence of spring sheep grazing, along with autumn cattle grazing in all regimes. After disturbance application, we sowed a seed mixture containing ten specialist species of calcareous grassland. Using quadrat-based methods, we monitored first-year establishment and subsequent dynamics, including reproductive status of species at quadrat level. Initial establishment and subsequent dynamics were analysed separately using LMM.Results: Initial establishment of sown species was promoted both by harrowing and by ridge-and-furrow creation. While some species were about equally promoted by both, several other species benefited more strongly or exclusively from ridge-and-furrow creation. Effects of disturbance largely persisted in subsequent years, but for some species, different dynamics were observed for harrowed and ridge-and-furrow treatments. Thymus pulegioides and Hippocrepis comosa gradually achieved higher abundances in the ridge-and-furrow treatment, in which notable levels of bare ground persisted for much longer than in the harrowed treatment. In contrast, Filipendula vulgaris and Pimpinella saxifraga achieved higher abundance in the harrowed treatment. Sown species tended to reach reproductive stage faster in the ridge-and-furrow treatment than in the harrowed treatment. By the end of the study, management regimes had resulted in few effects on species dynamics.Conclusions: Establishment of specialist species of calcareous grassland crucially depended on bare ground creation prior to sowing. Ridge-and-furrow creation resulted in more persistent reduction of competition than the standard practice of harrowing, provided more suitable conditions for low-statured specialist species, and generally enabled faster transition of introduced specialist species to reproductive stage. Our results thus illustrate potential benefits of using more severe disturbance when introducing specialist species of calcareous grassland at restored sites."	14	1	0	0	11	0	14	2016-01-01	WOS:000368074600011	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Does either mix reduce survival of exotic annual grasses during early life stages, and does this effect differ with soil type? Is exotic performance stronger in one soil type, and does native performance when growing with exotics differ between soil types as a result of exotic preference?LocationUniversity of Nevada Agricultural Research Station, Reno, NV, US.MethodsWe compared seedling emergence and early survival (Nov through May) of two native seed mixes, each composed of grass, forb and shrub functional groups, when growing with B.tectorum or T.caput-medusae in soils of contrasting texture (sandy loam and clay loam). Natives were also seeded without exotics. Performance of an early seral mix was compared with that of a late seral mix representative of species commonly used in Great Basin restoration.ResultsComparing emergence and survival probabilities, early seral natives generally outperformed late seral natives when growing with exotics and had earlier emergence timing, although results differed among functional groups and soil types. In contrast, survival probabilities did not differ between the early and late seral mixes when growing without exotics. Within each seed mix, native grasses exhibited the highest emergence probabilities of the functional groups. Natives did not suppress exotics in early life stages. Performance of B.tectorum was higher on sandy loam, while T.caput-medusae was highly successful in both soil types. Performance of native functional groups differed by soil type when growing with exotics but did not differ when growing without exotics. Survival of native grasses, in particular, was generally higher on sandy loam when growing with exotics.ConclusionsFindings suggest that the use of early seral natives in areas invaded by exotic annual grasses may improve early seedling survival in the Great Basin, in comparison to the use of later seral species in traditional seed mixes. Variation in native performance in the two soil types may be helpful in tailoring seed mixes to different sites."	10	0	0	0	6	0	16	2015-10-01	WOS:000361181500009	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How do plant ecological strategies change with the progress of forest succession? Can a combination of some key leaf traits across species discriminate successional stages?Location: Loess Plateau region of northern Shaanxi, China.Methods: A set of 31 plots was established in the study area. Twenty-two traits were measured in 31 dominant species representative of six succession stages: three pertaining to morphology, nine to stoichiometry and ten to physiological ecology. Six traits related to photosynthesis were measured in 15 species.Results: Eleven of 22 leaf traits differed significantly along the succession gradient. Early succession species had leaves with higher specific leaf area (SLA), higher leaf phosphorus (P) content (LPC) and lower N/P ratio, which assured higher growth rates and resource acquisition. Species from more advanced stages had a higher leaf dry mass content (LDMC), leaf carbon (C) content (LCC), leaf construction cost (CC) and C/P ratio, indicating improved competiveness through efficient nutrient conservation. None of the traits related to photosynthesis differed significantly among successional stages. Differences between traits among life forms also revealed that changes in traits with succession were due to the turnover of life forms in dominant species along the succession gradient.Conclusions: The results provide clear evidence of functional links between leaf traits and forest succession in the Loess Plateau ecosystem, confirming trait-based trade-off of nutrient acquisition vs conservation during succession. We recommend using a combination of seven key leaf traits across species to discriminate between the succession stages."	34	4	0	0	29	0	39	2014-12-31	WOS:000345761800007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This study focused on the differential effects of the two inorganic N forms in atmospheric deposition (i.e. ammonium and nitrate).Methods and location: Nutrient addition experiments were carried out during 4 years in a mesotrophic fen in a low-deposition area in Ireland. In a factorial design, plots were fertilized with ammonium and/or nitrate, in two doses comparable with 35 and 70 kgN ha(-1) y(-1) and compared with an unfertilized control.Results: Vascular plant biomass as well as bryophyte biomass were not affected by N dose but showed significantly different responses to the N form. In the ammonium-fertilized plots, vascular plant biomass was higher and moss biomass was lower than the control, while nitrate additions had no effect. Vascular plant species density was high (16 species per 0.49 m(2)) and was not affected by any of the treatments; bryophyte species density was also high (seven species per 0.04 m(2)) but showed a significant decrease upon ammonium fertilization.Conclusion: The vulnerability of the mesotrophic vegetation to enhanced atmospheric N deposition depends strongly on the N form. If N would be mainly deposited as NO(x), no detrimental effects on the vegetation will occur. If, however, the deposition is mainly in the form of NH(y), the bryophyte vegetation will be seriously damaged, while the vascular plant vegetation will show an increased biomass production with possible shifts in dominance from Carex and herb species to grasses and shrubs."	40	6	0	0	38	0	45	2011-03-23	WOS:000287863600001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Changes in seed banks were also compared with areas where A. longifolia and the litter layer were removed.ResultsSpecies richness, seedling density and diversity were higher in non-invaded and recently-invaded areas than in long-invaded areas. Although there was an apparent similarity between non-invaded and recently-invaded areas, analyses of species traits revealed differences. Non-invaded areas had a wider array of traits. Exotic/invasive species dominated invaded seed banks while native species dominated non-invaded seed banks. Life forms, growth forms, longevity and dispersal mode showed differences between areas, with cleared plots of long-invaded areas being apparently the most similar to non-invaded plots. Acacia longifolia seeds were most abundant in long-invaded areas, particularly where the litter layer remained. Removal of A. longifolia plus the litter had little effect on the seed bank composition of recently-invaded areas but resulted in noticeable changes in seed banks of long-invaded areas.ConclusionsLong-invaded areas are less resilient and show a higher reinvasion potential, despite severe alteration of the seed banks of both areas.

Changes in the species composition of plots were analysed by correlating changes in mean Ellenberg indicator values with the displacement of plots within a Multidimensional scaling ordination.Results: Trends in single species abundance were positively correlated with indicator values of soil pH but were independent of nutrient availability. A general trend towards the homogenisation of vegetation, due to convergent time vectors of the releves. became obvious. Oligotrophic sites previously situated at the distal ends of ordination axes shifted towards the centre since they were enriched by species preferring mesotrophic condition's.

Each sample was sown and placed in a greenhouse. After three months, the trays were dried and stored at 4 C in a dry place for two months. This was repeated twice.Results: There was a separation of the two regions along the first DCA axis in both the seed bank and in the vegetation analysis and also a clear separation of the seed bank from the vegetation along the second axis. These results are caused by differences in former management as well as temperature, precipitation and soil type between Gaular and Orkdal. We found more annuals, short-lived species and species demanding light open conditions in the seed bank than in the vegetation probably because these species have the capacity for producing persistent seeds.

This study aimed to establish whether there is any relationship between two plant traits: specific leaf area (SLA) and number of reproductive tillers, and sward structural characteristics which influence herbage intake by grazers (bulk density and digestibility, leaf:stem ratio). Comparison is made for nutrient-rich (Dactylis glomerata) and nutrient-poor (Festuca rubra) grass species. We hypothesized that these traits are responsive to environmental gradients and also act on the processes of the ecosystem. Both grasses were compared with two P-fertilizer rates in two localities (200 and 1300 m a.s.l.) which differed in their temperature:radiation ratios. For the vegetative phase SLA was well correlated with sward characteristics: D. glomerata, which has the higher SLA, has the lower bulk density and higher digestibility. The values of SLA and vegetation bulk density varied according to growing conditions (P-rate and temperature: radiation ratio), but the ranking of the species remained the same because the phenotypic plasticity that exists for plant traits was also observed for sward structure and composition. That suggested the possibility of grouping natural grassland species for their relevant characteristics for grazers according to SLA values. Over the reproductive phase, the proportion of stems was well correlated to the percentage of reproductive tillers. However, the percentage of reproductive tillers was a very plastic trait for both species, depending on the growing conditions, and resulting in a density-dependent effect, particularly for F. rubra. The species studied were too plastic and too similar in their regenerative strategy so that there is no unique relationship between percentage of reproductive tillers and stem proportion, regardless of the species and the growing conditions. The number of reproductive tillers is not a suitable plant trait which could be used to rank species for leaf and stem proportions in the sward."	24	0	0	0	17	0	25	2004-05-01	WOS:000221960200002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The donor site was an extensively managed mesophilic meadow and the receiving site was a neighbouring arable land. The vegetation of the translocated meadow was described 8 and 17 months after soil translocation, and compared (1) with vegetation resulting from more classical restoration techniques tested on the arable land (natural regeneration and seed mixture sowing) and (2) with the soil seed bank and vegetation previously present on the donor site. Results showed that the soil translocation technique permitted the development of many meadow species, including two legally protected species, and few ruderal species despite a large area of bare ground. This technique seems effective in terms of number and abundance of meadow species compared to natural regeneration and commercial seed sowing.

A floristic and environmental survey was carried out on 22 uninhabited islands (0.1-8.4 ha) in Lake Burollos, Egypt. A total of 58 vascular plant species was recorded. The number of habitats on each island was counted. There was a positive correlation between island area and number of habitat types. Island area was significantly positively correlated with various measures of floristic diversity, including the total number of species present, and the numbers of annual, herbaceous, and shrublet species. Perennial and shrub species numbers did not differ significantly with island area. In addition to island area, elevation and soil salinity, as well as distance to the Mediterranean Sea, all contributed significantly to variation in species composition in the terrestrial habitats. Water salinity and transparency accounted for 69% of the variation in aquatic species numbers. There was a weak effect of isolation on similarity of species composition on islands. Eight vegetation types, represented by 13 indicator species identified after TWINSPAN analysis, were distinguished by soil characteristics. Species richness was inversely correlated with clay, organic carbon and total nitrogen in the soil, but positively correlated with calcium carbonate content. From a management perspective, long-term monitoring of threatened habitats in the lake is urgently required as a starting point to preserve biodiversity. Finally, we conclude that the present study supports the hypothesis indicating that larger areas feature higher species richness due to increased numbers of habitats."	22	0	0	0	17	0	27	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We tested whether rewetting improved environmental conditions during peatland restoration and promoted colonization and development of mire vegetation. Vegetation change was monitored in a cut-away peatland one year before, and four years after, rewetting. Colonizers before rewetting were perennials, mostly typical of hummocks or bare peat surfaces. The main variation in vegetation was related to variation in the amounts of major nutrients and water table level. The wettest site with the highest nutrient level had the highest total vegetation cover and diversity, as well as some species typical of wet minerotrophic mires. Raising the water table level above, or close to, the soil surface promoted development of wet minerotrophic vegetation. Diversity initially decreased because of the disappearance of hummock vegetation but started to recover in the third year. Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex rostrata were both favoured, and bryophytes typical of wet habitats colonized the site. Moderate rewetting promoted the development of Eriophorum vaginatum seedlings and an increase in the cover of tussocks. Bryophytes typical of disturbed peat surfaces spread. In the control site development continued slowly towards closed hummock vegetation. The study showed that raising the water level to, or above, soil surface promotes conditions wet enough for a rapid succession towards closed mire vegetation."	68	1	0	0	54	0	83	2000-12-01	WOS:000208472300008	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Hydrology of Dutch Cirsio-Molinietum meadows: Prospects for restoration	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	3	1	NA	NA	51	64	NA	10.2307/1478918	Article	MAY 2000	2000	". Fen meadows (Cirsio dissecti-Molinietum) are seriously threatened by desiccation, acidification and eutro-phication. In The Netherlands several projects were launched to restore damaged fen meadows. This review describes how successes and failures of these restoration projects depend on hydrological systems. Six hydrological systems have been distinguished, which all provide the site conditions required by this community. Nowadays, the best developed fen meadows are found in the higher Pleistocene landscape of The Netherlands, where they depend on base-rich groundwater discharging from local or large groundwater systems. Fen meadows of the lower Holocene landscape usually occur in man-made surface water systems. Almost all stands have been severely deteriorated. Restoration of fen meadows in the Pleistocene landscape is promising when the hydrology is only slightly disturbed or when hydrological measures are taken in combination with sod cutting. Restoration prospects of fen meadows in the Holocene landscape are low. Until now a complete regeneration of Cirsio-Molinietum meadows has not been realized. Restoration measures failed to restore high pH values in the top soil. It is hypothesized that viable seeds of many target species lack in the soil seed bank. In addition, the dispersal capacities of these species seem to be limited."	31	0	0	0	22	0	34	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200007	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, South American megafauna was largely driven to extinction in recent prehistory, and remaining species have suffered severe range reductions from human actions. The potential role of South American megafauna in shaping vegetation therefore remains unclear. We examined herbivore-driven top-down control of the vegetation, particularly impacts on plant diversity, structure and functional composition. LocationIber & aacute; Wetlands, Corrientes, Argentina. Methods: We set up an herbivore exclosure experiment in a restoration area with 10 wild large-herbivore species. We compared vegetation dynamics in fenced plots with paired control plots to which herbivores had full access. Replicate plot pairs were established in three grassland types: characterized as short, medium-tall and tall grasslands. Grass height, plant biomass, functional types and community composition were measured at the start of the experiment and after 6, 13 and 18 months. Results: We found that in short and medium-tall grasslands, herbaceous biomass and grass height increased significantly in no-grazing plots, while species richness decreased. Similarly, community dissimilarity between paired grazed and ungrazed plots increased over time for short and medium-tall grasslands. Camera trap images revealed that capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) was the dominant grazer on the grazed plots. Conclusion: Our results show a strong impact of native herbivores on the structure and composition of South American savannas akin to African grazing lawns, with higher plant species richness and dominance of grazing-tolerant growth forms. These results imply that South American grassy ecosystems, despite severely reduced herbivore richness and density, have retained plant taxa and functional trait complexes that tolerate intense herbivory. Further, they also show that herbivory can still play an important role in maintaining their plant diversity. The conservation and restoration of South American grassy ecosystems are likely to benefit from restoring functional grazing regimes."	2	0	0	0	0	0	2	2025-03-08	WOS:001435561200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Natural regeneration, whereby vegetation regrows on its own via the propagules already within the landscape, is a cost-effective restoration approach for old fields. It is vital that we understand how different seed sources contribute to the regenerative capacity of old fields to make informed management decisions. Little is known about seed rain as a propagule source for restoration within semi-arid floodplains of eastern Australia.LocationWithin this study, we examined seed rain and extant vegetation in old fields and paired remnant sites across four regions in the northern Murray-Darling Basin, eastern Australia.MethodsSeed rain was surveyed using seed traps that were then subjected to a seedling emergence experiment.ResultsMinimal differences in seed rain composition, species richness, abundance, and plant functional groups were observed between old-field and remnant sites, indicating similarities in seed dispersal within both land use histories. Larger distances to remnant patches and mean annual rainfall were found to drive the composition of old field's seed rain. The study found few emerged Eucalyptus seedlings despite seed traps being placed during peak seed release periods, which may be due to poor tree conditions from drought, interference with seed traps and the episodic germination requirements of Eucalyptus coolabah.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that seed rain can contribute to the natural regeneration of understorey vegetation, with low abundances of exotic species, unlike other seed bank types. However, seed rain composition resembled little of the extant vegetation, suggesting a species pool facing barriers to germination and establishment, but likely linked to bet-hedging strategies. Moving forward to promote natural regeneration via seed rain in old fields, protecting existing patches of vegetation within the landscape is vital to enable biotic connectivity."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2024-12-09	WOS:001368737500001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How do seed mass and seed dispersal mode change from forests to pastures across these elevations? What implications do these changes have for the recovery of deforested areas in tropical mountains?LocationOld-growth montane forests and livestock pastures along an elevational gradient (1,000-3,000 m a.s.l.), located at Podocarpus National Park, San Francisco Reserve and surrounding agricultural lands, Andes of southern Ecuador.MethodsWe collected seed rain for a 3-month period using 324 traps installed at eighteen 1-ha plots across elevations. Half of the traps were installed in nine 1-ha forest plots, and the other half in nine 1-ha pasture plots. For each trap, we identified the seeds and measured seed rain biomass and richness. We also recorded seed traits and calculated community-weighted means of seed mass and seed dispersal mode (proportion of endozoochory).ResultsForests received a higher seed rain biomass than pastures, but only at the lowest elevation. Seed rain richness did not differ between habitat types at all elevations. Community-weighted means of seed mass and the proportion of endozoochorous species declined from forests to pastures, especially at the lower elevations.ConclusionsAlthough seed rain biomass and richness were overall similar between forests and pastures, large-seeded and endozoochorous species were generally poorly represented in the seed rain of pastures compared with that of forests. These findings show that biomass and richness of seed rain may be insufficient to quantify the restoration potential of natural seed rain in deforested areas. Information on seed traits, such as seed mass and seed dispersal mode, is important to optimize restoration efforts towards the regeneration of diverse old-growth forests along elevational gradients in tropical mountains.By analyzing variation in seed rain among old-growth montane forests and livestock pastures along a 2,000 m elevational gradient in the tropical Andes of southern Ecuador, this study reveals that large seeds and endozoochorous species are less prevalent in seed rain from pastures compared to seed rain from forests at the same elevation.image"	2	0	0	0	2	0	2	2024-06-14	WOS:001242611300001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Following the making of Iceland's largest hydropower reservoir in 2006, a decadal vegetation monitoring was set up. Relating our results to those of different types of environmental monitoring associated with the hydropower project, we aimed to gain insights into the forces driving the spatio-temporal vegetation pattern.LocationSubarctic-alpine area near Halslon reservoir, East Iceland.MethodsAt the time of its making, we conducted a baseline plant survey in a total of 72 plots, spread around Halslon reservoir's vicinity (each containing ten 0.25 m2 subplots). Plots were located in three different habitat types (heathlands, wetlands, poorly vegetated land), at three different sites regarding direction and distance from the reservoir. A decade later, we resurveyed the plots and reviewed the results of other environmental monitoring projects in the area, mostly presented in the gray literature.ResultsTemporal changes in vegetation were mostly inconsistent between and within habitat types, but some general trends were noticed, that is, decreased lichen and fern cover in heathlands. Distance from the reservoir did not significantly affect changes in vegetation cover. The greatest overall changes were detected where great changes in herbivore land usage had been recorded during the study.ConclusionsDirect effects of Halslon reservoir on vegetation in our study plots were not noticed. Most likely, the reservoir indirectly impacted vegetation in our study through loss of grazing area, affecting herbivore land usage, coupled with an unrelated population growth of two of the area's main wild herbivores before and during the study period. Response to climate change was not detected, potentially concealed by substantial land-use change and a short study period.Resurvey of vegetation monitoring in a subarctic-alpine area near Iceland's largest hydropower reservoir revealed that after a decade, changes were mostly inconsistent between and within habitats. Direct effects of the reservoir and climate change were not found but rather, indirect effects of altered herbivory behavior, partly influenced by anthropogenic activities.image"	2	0	0	0	1	0	2	2024-04-08	WOS:001196383000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	25	3	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12681	10.1111/avsc.12681	Article	JUL 2022	2022	"Aims Historical land-use legacies and chemical soil characteristics both explain either directly or indirectly the habitat quality of Nardus grassland, which is protected under the European habitat directive. Yet the relative importance and complementarity of both sets of variables are generally unknown. This knowledge is also relevant for practical reasons, as historical land-use variables can be used in desktop spatial analyses, whereas soil characteristics require field surveys to collect samples for laboratory analyses. To this end, we aim to disentangle the relative importance of historical land-use legacies and soil chemistry for the Nardus grassland quality, and determine the potential of habitat suitability mapping for predicting potential restoration areas. Location Natura 2000 grasslands in Flanders (northern Belgium). Methods We compared the model performance of three generalized additive models (GAMs), using either land-use history metrics, soil chemistry, or both as explanatory variables, with the Nardus grassland indicator species count as response. Results All three models were able to predict areas suitable for at least three Nardus grassland indicator species with high sensitivity and specificity. However, a minimum of four indicator species are required for a favorable conservation status of Natura 2000 Nardus grasslands in Flanders. Using this threshold to detect high-priority zones, the model based on historical land-use variables resulted in a lower sensitivity than models which included soil chemistry. Conclusions We suggest a two-step approach, with an a priori desktop spatial analysis based on historical land-use variables subdivided in a high-priority zone and a lower-priority zone. If the targeted area for restoration or conservation can be found within the high-priority zone, additional soil analyses are only required to help guide conservation and restoration measures. If additional sites are considered within the lower-priority zone, a field survey to collect additional soil data is recommended."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2022-09-24	WOS:000854868600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In desert rangeland, many plants produce relatively large fruits that are limited in their long-distance dispersal abilities and, therefore, depend on transport inside animals, a process termed endozoochory. Evaluating the effectiveness of this process from experimental data is crucial for assessing the potential of domestic ungulates as effective long-distance seed dispersers and, consequently, as management and restoration tools in degraded rangelands. Methods In this study we jointly estimated recovery, gut retention time (RT) and germination probability of Prosopis flexuosa seeds (a tree species of Monte desert in Argentina) transported by goats, horses and cattle (n = 4) through a seed-feeding experiment. Also, in horses and cattle, we used plastic particles to distinguish between seed loss due to mastication and due to degradation in the gut. Results Results showed higher seed recovery in horses (26%) than in cattle (3%) and goats (5%), and different values of RT and germination of seeds among species (in decreasing order, RT was: cattle > goats > horses; and germination was: goat > horses > cattle = control seeds). Conclusions We concluded that the quality of seed treatment by horses is better than by the other species, because of the high seed recovery and high germination compared to control seeds. To get a complete picture of this mutualistic interaction, future studies could inquire about the physical and chemical properties of faeces as substrate and the environmental conditions of sites where seeds are deposited."	8	1	0	0	7	0	9	2022-04-17	WOS:000777849700001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Here, we investigated the influence of seed density and single and mixed species on germination percentage and timing using annual wetland plants of the Pantanal in Brazil. Location Seeds were collected from annual species occupying a seasonally flooded grassland, at Fazenda Sao Bento (19 degrees 29 ' 27,3 '' S; 57 degrees 01 ' 55,9 '' W), in the Abobral sub-region, Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul (Central-West Brazil). Methods Experiments on the effects of seed density dependence on the germination time in intraspecific (single-species) and interspecific (mixed-species) treatments were conducted with ten annual species at three levels: for intraspecific - scarce (one seed), moderate (10 seeds), and high (20 seeds); and for interspecific - low (one each), medium (10) and abundant (20). Results The germination percentage was independent of density and species mixtures. Germination time was density-dependent for the mixed-species treatment, but not the single-species treatments. Six species had a shorter germination time, suggesting a group priority effect. Other species delayed or did not alter their germination time, indicating that the response to intraspecific seed densities is species-specific. Conclusion These findings illustrate that even though species have a history of coexistence and characteristics of rapid germination, seeds can alter germination time if they perceive neighbouring seeds of other species. Species that respond with a faster germination time may have a competitive advantage for recruitment and growth. These terrestrial species show high initial colonization power, which is essential in the regeneration of wetlands after flood disturbance."	2	2	0	0	2	0	3	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900005	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Grazing (top-down control) and nutrient availability (bottom-up control) may interactively modify plant biomass, which is particularly important in grasslands devoted to livestock production. Here, we aim to understand the interactive effects of grazing and fertilization on grassland plant biomass. We hypothesized that the joint effects of nutrient addition and domestic grazing on above-ground plant biomass are not additive, but they modify each other through changes in ground-level light, leaf nutritional quality, above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), and below-ground plant allocation.Location: Flooding Pampa (Buenos Aires, Argentina).Methods: We carried out a factorial experiment of grazing exclusion and fertilization with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium + micronutrients during several years in a mesic grassland devoted to livestock production.Results: After four years, grazing reduced live above-ground plant biomass by 52%, and when combined with fertilization this reduction was 70%. Nutrient addition in the grazed grassland increased ANPP and leaf nutrient concentration. These changes in turn intensified grazing pressure and cattle's plant consumption. By contrast, fertilization did not produce any significant effect on plant biomass or ANPP inside the exclosures, where ground-level light was low. A structural equation model revealed that the increase in ANPP fostered above-ground and reduced below-ground plant biomass.Conclusions: This is the first study conducted in the Pampas grasslands that evaluated the effect of cattle grazing and fertilization on plant communities under field conditions over several years. Grazing and nutrient addition synergistically controlled grassland plant biomass, as the reduction in above-ground biomass by cattle consumption was greater in fertilized plots. Our results provided empirical evidence that leaf nitrogen and ANPP modulated plant biomass dynamics in grasslands devoted to livestock production in the context of increased nutrient loads in terrestrial ecosystems."	9	0	0	0	6	0	11	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Ecological theory suggests that manipulating dispersal, abiotic and biotic filters limiting plant re-establishment will improve restoration outcomes. Here, we manipulated spread depth of soil containing a salvaged soil seedbank (dispersal filter), soil compaction (abiotic filter) and herbivore grazing (biotic filter) in a topsoil transfer experiment to test their effects on restoration success.Location: Banksia woodland of the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia.Methods: Topsoil (upper similar to 7 cm) with its seedbank was removed from a donor site (20 ha) of recently cleared native vegetation and transferred to six recipient restoration sites (16 ha). Deep (10 cm thick) and shallow (5 cm thick) layers of topsoil were applied in a fully factorial experiment, with and without soil ripping and fencing, respectively. We analysed emergence, survival and functional types (alien/native, life form, fire response) of all vascular plant species for two consecutive years after topsoil transfer.Results: The most successful restoration treatment was deep topsoil with a mean density of 14.3 m(-2) native perennial germinants in year one and 7.3 m(-2) in year two. Application of deep topsoil increased native seedling emergence by 34% and decreased weed density by 21% compared with shallow topsoil. Overall seedling survival across the two-year period was unaffected by filter treatments (range 0.6%-5%). After two years, the resulting plant community was 6%-38% weed species and of native perennial species, 12%-48% were capable of resprouting.Conclusions: Manipulation of the dispersal filter alone, that is deep topsoil application, can lead to near-equivalent native species number emerging on restoration sites as compared to pre-cleared woodland. However, more research is required to test additional restoration tools to improve survival of biodiverse plant communities. For example, targeted herbicide application coupled with soil ripping to improve weed management and native seedling establishment."	9	1	0	0	7	0	10	2020-11-30	WOS:000589518700001	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How are hay meadow dynamics affected by the environment excluding management? Location Central Apennines, Italy. Methods Vegetation was studied in 66 hay meadows by random plots, recording four groups of explanatory variables: management, soil, topography, and space. Using partial ordinations, the explanatory variables of the variation in floristic composition and plant traits were divided into sets. Then, to emphasize the relationship between purely environmental variables and vegetation, we considered only the partial ordination executed with soil and topographic variables using management and spatial data as covariables. Results The soil variables had the highest marginal explanatory power. Organic matter was the main driver of floristic composition, indicating a gradient associated also with soil moisture. The pure effect of spatial variables was very important, reflecting historical processes. On the contrary, management and topography variables sets were relatively weak predictors. Partial ordination showed that two topographic variables, slope and height above the plain, had an important weight in the hay meadow floristic assemblage, influencing soil fertility. Conclusions This analysis (a) confirms the determining function of soil fertility and moisture in driving plant species composition and traits; (b) focuses on the marginal power of current management when past traditional agro-pastoral activity undergoes changes in mode and intensity; (c) highlights the role of spatial variables and site history; and (d) improves knowledge about topographical factors as drivers of species composition. The maintenance of hay meadow mosaics requires preservation of grasslands in complete topographical catenae and prevention of the abandonment of parcels on steep slopes.

Fire season can have important consequences for the relative abundance of plant species adopting these regeneration strategies. The present study aimed to test for differential effects of fire season on perennial plant community composition. Location Eastern Mediterranean woodland in the Judea Mountains, Israel. Methods We conducted, for the first time, a large-scale field experiment, involving prescribed spring and autumn burns in a typical eastern Mediterranean woodland. We sampled the perennial plant community before and after the burns, quantifying temporal changes in community composition caused by seasonal fires. Results Although fire intensity and severity were consistent between the two seasonal fires, plant community composition differed between areas subjected to spring or autumn burns. The abundances of all common species, Pistacia lenticus (obligate resprouter), Cistus spp. (obligate seeders) and Teucrium divaricatum (facultative seeder), were all reduced by both fires. Yet, their dominance in the post-fire perennial plant community was retained. Differential fire season effects were detected only among obligate seeders, which experienced a stronger reduction in abundance after spring than after autumn burns. Conclusions Differential fire season effects on the perennial plant community resulted from phenological rather than fire intensity/severity effects. Such changes in community composition may have important implications for plant community dynamics, because they affect the circle of fire event-plant regeneration-fire reoccurrence, determining the probability and intensity of future fires. Furthermore, even though the eastern mediterranean ecosystem is considered highly resilient to disturbances, increased spatio-temporal variation in fire season, may result in a new vegetation mosaic, differing from the contemporary one, i.e., an alternative stable state."	11	1	0	0	8	0	14	2019-03-11	WOS:000459825800012	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Ecological niche models were used to estimate locally optimal conditions of maximum inundation duration, elevation above daily peak flow, mean annual precipitation and mean maximum and minimum temperature for 16 of the most abundant woody and 58 of the most abundant herbaceous plant species. These estimates were used to calculate CWM environmental preferences, which were used to determine how closely vegetation preferences tracked local variation in environmental factors, and to assess interactive responses of species and communities to variation in hydrology and climate.Results: Communities closely tracked hydrological variation across zones, but less so within zones. Communities tracked variation in minimum temperature more closely than maximum temperature or precipitation. At the species level, woody plants that were more abundant in wetter hydrological conditions were also more abundant in wetter climatic conditions, and vice versa. This relationship was even stronger at the community level, where there were significant negative relationships between CWM preferences of inundation duration and temperature for both woody and herbaceous vegetation.Conclusions: The climate-hydrology linkages found in this system suggest that increasing temperatures and drought are likely to reduce the inundation tolerance of riparian vegetation within the Grand Canyon. Increasing the duration of high-flow events would likely reduce the abundance of encroaching woody vegetation but could also reduce the resilience of remaining vegetation to heatwaves and drought. The reinforcing effects of climatic and hydrological filters are likely to generally result in greater sensitivity of species composition to environmental change than if those environmental filters acted independently. These results have implications for predicting resource responses to environmental change, as well as prescriptions for direct vegetation management to enhance resilience."	21	0	0	0	14	0	23	2018-12-28	WOS:000450061000002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Influence of topography on long-termsuccessional trajectories in canyon grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	20	2	NA	NA	236	246	NA	10.1111/avsc.12272	Article	APR 2017	2017	"Question: Some of the last remaining grassland communities of the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Region (PNWBR) in North America are found in canyon grasslands, primarily because the rugged topography has leftmany of these associations untouched by agricultural development. However, there have been no prior examinations into how canyon grassland communities change over the long term or how topography relates to these changes. In this study, we examined how successional stages changed over a 33-yr time period and which topographical variables were most related to these long-term outcomes (elevation, aspect or slope). We predicted that areas with more gentle slopes (< 20%) would have changed themost because they have seen a higher concentration of historical land uses (e. g. livestock grazing, wildlife herbivory, and cultivation).Location: Canyon grasslands of Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, northwest USA.Methods: We looked at how the canyon grasslands have changed over the long term by repeating a vegetation survey of plant species cover and frequency that was completed in 1981 and comparing the results after a 33-yr time period.Results: We found that 58% of our plots stayed in the same seral stage or transitioned into later ones. As predicted, the plots that remained in early seral condition or transitioned from later to early seral stages were found on more shallow slopes. In addition, drier aspects within all plant associations appeared to be less resistant and resilient to change, particularly invasion by exotic species.Conclusions: The results of this resurvey suggest that topographic patterns may not only be related to the distribution of plant associations across the canyon grasslands, but may also influence which sites change most over time. Our findings are consistent with other studies of the relationships between topography and land uses through time in other grasslands, and are highly relevant to conservation management where unique vegetation communities develop within heterogeneous topographic areas."	15	0	0	0	7	0	19	2017-04-26	WOS:000398083700009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The aim was to assess the effects produced on (1) vegetation structure and (2) botanical composition of both pastoral practices in order to identify their potential to reverse shrub encroachment and restore semi-natural grassland vegetation.Location: Shrub-encroached sites in Val Troncea Natural Park, southwest Italian Alps.Methods: We measured the effects produced by both practices on vegetation cover and height, cover of species belonging to different vegetation units, biodiversity indices (species richness and Shannon diversity index), forage pastoral value, and average indicator value for soil nutrient content from 2011 to 2014 along permanent linear transects. Data were analysed with GLMMs, multiple response permutational procedure (MRPP) and principal response curve (PRC).Results: Both practices were effective in reducing shrub cover and increasing average height of the herbaceous layer, but within TNCA a marked increase in herbaceous cover was also evident. Moreover, the arrangement of TNCA increased the cover of meso-eutrophic grassland and fringe and tall herb species and decreased the cover of boreal-like shrubland and woodland species. The main effect produced by the placement of MMS on botanical composition was an increase in cover of fringe and tall herb species. Plant biodiversity was enhanced by the arrangement of TNCA but not by the placement of MMS, and the implementation of both practices increased forage pastoral value and average indicator value for soil nutrient content.Conclusions: The arrangement of TNCA was the most effective pastoral practice to reverse shrub encroachment, restore semi-natural meso-eutrophic grassland vegetation and increase plant diversity, herbage mass and forage quality."	45	3	0	0	27	0	49	2016-07-01	WOS:000384751300003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Linear models indicated that cliff angle was the strongest explanatory variable of species richness and abundance for all three taxonomic groups. Once the effects of biophysical variables were modelled, analysis of the residuals indicated that potential climbing-use intensity had a small but negative effect on species richness and abundance of vascular plants (range 3-6%), no effect on bryophytes (0%) and a substantial effect on lichens (range 10-12%). Similarly, NMDS ordination indicated that cliff angle, canopy height and aspect were the primary drivers of species composition. We observed no change in community composition due to climbing.ConclusionsOther studies have observed significant impacts of climbing on vegetation at the base of cliffs. Here, we observe that potential climbing-use intensity has some impact on species richness and abundance of vascular plants and more significant impacts on lichens, however cliff angle is a fundamental control on cliff vegetation. Because of the challenge in sampling steep and overhanging cliffs, we recommend that climbers be directly involved in the assessment, monitoring and management of cliff resources in order to ensure that the full range of biophysical conditions of cliff ecosystems are considered."	35	0	0	0	27	0	39	2015-10-01	WOS:000361181500016	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Data were analyzed using ordination, ANOVA and a generalized linear model.ResultsSoil phosphorus and nitrogen were significantly reduced by topsoil removal to the level of target communities. A remarkably high number of typical and endangered sand grassland species established, presumably from the seed/spore bank. Compared to old, seasonally grazed sand grassland, higher species diversity could be observed after topsoil removal. Reasons may be the raised pH as a heritage of arable cultivation and the very open vegetation structures enhancing early successional species. Year-round grazing preserved open vegetation structures, but was not able to fully suppress birch encroachment in early stages of succession.ConclusionsOur study showed that combining topsoil removal, self-greening via recruitment from the seed/spore bank and subsequent year-round grazing might be particularly successful approaches for the restoration of endangered sand grasslands and wet heaths on ex-arable land. However, additional measures might be necessary to prevent undesired shrub encroachment in the first years after topsoil removal.

Is it possible to model the Ellenberg moisture value (mF) using variables representing site moisture conditions? Does mF help predict changes in vegetation composition and thus help in validating restoration success?Location: Danube floodplain, Neuburg a. d. Donau, Bavaria, Germany.Methods: A Generalized additive model (GAM) and a generalized linear model (GLM) were used for spatial prediction of mF using groundwater, relief and soil variables as predictors. Vegetation response to a changed hydrological regime was tested through replacing the old groundwater model with a new model representing the new water regime. With the help of a GIS, a spatial distribution and a scenario map of mF was produced. Model validation was done by cross-validation and comparison between predicted and observed data from repeated vegetation sampling on permanent plots.Results: Groundwater level (minima of 2009) and soil thickness entered the final model as significant predictors of mF. The GAM of mF showed good predictive power, with more than 57% of deviance explained. The corresponding GLM had slightly lower accuracy, with 51% of deviance explained. Using the new groundwater model (minima of 2011) it was possible to forecast mF after restoration. Changes in mF are to be expected in areas directly affected by restoration measures. The model validation has proven that the quality of model prediction is good and represents the reality fairly well.Conclusions: The study has shown that mF is a useful indicator for a summary prediction of ecological change. It can be expected that restoration will turn overall conditions wetter, and vegetation will respond to these changes with an increase of wetland plant species. With the help of the model, it is possible to measure the success of the restoration project. It is demonstrated that GAM can be used for intensive data exploration, after which a less complex and easily computable GLM can be parameterized."	5	1	0	0	4	0	7	2014-07-16	WOS:000337725300016	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How adaptive is the vegetation, when species pool and time for dispersal do not limit? How constant is the species niche breadth along the soil pH gradient? Location Region of 30km around the Kunda cement plant, northern Estonia (59 degrees 30N, 26 degrees 32E), which has been continuously polluted last 140 years. Methods We sampled 20 forest stands on sandy gleyic podzols at various distances from the pollution source, leeward and windward of prevailing winds. Data processing: principal components analysis for gradient generalization, indicator species analysis for grouping species along the pollution gradient and generalized linear model analyses to estimate species reaction to pollution, considering covariates. Results The impact of alkaline dust accumulated over a century persisted despite resolute reductions of pollution. Forest soil conditions changed 10km leeward and 5km windward from the source: the litter pH level changed from 3.6 to 4.5 in unpolluted forests to 7.17.4 in the heavily polluted forests, and soil Ca content increased ten-fold. Soil alkalization has induced a remarkable succession from typical boreal vegetation toward vegetation of boreo-nemoral or calcareous habitats. We detected a linear increase of species richness from habitats on acidic soils (unpolluted) to newly formed alkaline soils (polluted habitats), reflecting the species pool composition and size, which is known to be large for calcicolous species. The establishment of several endangered calcicolous species shows the lack of dispersal limitation and points on their narrow soil pH niche. The niche breadth of species along the pH gradient varied among species, but only a few species appeared to be pH generalists. Conclusions Species ranking along the pH and/or Ca gradients indicates (1) the existence of different ecological guilds in terms of ecological niche use, and (2) the formation of a new community is dictated by the tolerance level of each species. This supports the individualistic community assembly rule suggested by Gleason. We find that such polluted regions with disturbed communities have high scientific value as long-term ecological experiments, but this might lead to conflict between the peculiar biodiversity complex and human well-being."	26	0	0	0	23	0	26	2013-04-01	WOS:000315690500010	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Although changes in species composition and species richness have been documented for many individual systems, little long-term research has been done on a regional scale. We compared the temporal patterns of plant diversity over the last 30 yr in agricultural grasslands and nature reserves. Location Grasslands scattered over the entire province of South-Holland, the Netherlands. Methods Using data from 403 permanent plots over a period of 30 yr, we analysed temporal trends in species richness, floristic value and indicated nutrient richness and compared these trends between agricultural grasslands and grasslands in nature reserves. Results Expressed as 30-yr averages, species richness and floristic value were much higher in nature reserve grasslands than in agricultural grasslands (an increase of 87% and 78%, respectively), while indicated nutrient richness (determined using indicator values for soil fertility of the species present) was 31% lower. During this 30-yr period, species richness and floristic value significantly increased in nature reserve grasslands (0.186 species.yr-1). For agricultural grasslands, however, no significant changes could be detected. Restricting the analysis to those plots that were already studied before 1990 did reveal significant declines in the agricultural grasslands, indicating a past decrease in species richness that has probably levelled off after 1990. Conclusions These findings imply that the floristic gap between agricultural grasslands and grasslands in nature reserves is widening every year. This may have consequences for conservation efforts in both nature reserves and agricultural grasslands. The challenge is to enhance the interaction between nature reserves and agricultural grasslands."	12	0	0	0	12	0	14	2012-07-25	WOS:000305936800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

For bedding material we used: gypsum spoil, topsoil addition on gypsum spoil, raw gypsum and topsoil removal. The surface treatments were: control, sowing, sowing plus organic matter and sowing plus an organic blanket. There were five replicates per combination treatment (80 plots in total, of 25 m (2) each). The sowing was performed in Nov 2009. All subplots were monitored to estimate density, richness, survival, growth of seedlings and herbaceous biomass, in two monitoring periods (Jul and Oct).Results: No gypsophiles or gypsovags were found in the control plots (no sowing or surface treatment), and therefore natural succession proved ineffective in the first year. In contrast, sowing was very satisfactory, especially on gypsum spoil, where mean density was of more than 15 individuals m(-2). This result is noteworthy as this material remains after the end of gypsum mining activity. Spreading topsoil over gypsum spoil proved to be no more positive, since it provided not only seeds of target species but also of competitor species. Also, with regard to herbaceous species, this treatment produced a highly significant increase of biomass. The organic blanket increased plant density, whereas the addition of organicmatter had significant positive effects on survival and growth of the seedlings. The global high survival rate is remarkable, especially for the gypsum spoil treatment.Conclusions: We highlight the importance of implementing recovery measures in gypsum habitats. An appropriate selection of seed mixture and density, as well as the use of gypsum spoil (the most favourable bedding material, according the results), is sufficient to ensure presence of the key species. Both technical solutions tested, organic blanket installation and organic matter addition, improved the results in terms of density, survival and growth of the seedlings."	40	1	0	0	30	0	44	2012-03-28	WOS:000301047300004	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

From 1971 to 1979, two different fertiliser treatments were applied twice a year to a subset of the plots (artificial fertiliser with different proportions of nitrogen and phosphorus). The vegetation of the plots was recorded yearly and vegetation biomass samples were taken for peak standing crop and total amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Species composition and floristic diversity were analysed over the research period (1970-2006) and between the treatments, including the use of multivariate techniques (Detrended Correspondence Analysis).Results: In terms of species number, there is a clear optimum 10 to 20 years after fertilisation has been terminated. Afterwards, there is a slow decrease; no new species appear and species of more nutrient-rich conditions gradually disappear. For the fertilised plots that received a relatively high proportion of N, effects are found only in the first years, whereas, for the plots that received a relatively high proportion of P, long-term after-effects are found in species composition, peak standing crop, total amounts of phosphorus in biomass, and in soil phosphorus data.Conclusions: The effect of artificial fertiliser with a large amount of nitrogen disappears in less than ten years when mown in August, including removal of the hay. This is a promising result for restoration of N-enriched calcareous grasslands, as the applied dose of nitrogen in this experiment largely exceeds the extra input of nitrogen via atmospheric deposition. Application of fertiliser with a large amount of phosphorus, however, has effects even more than 25 years after the last addition. There are no prospects that this effect will become reduced in the near future under the current mowing management."	65	1	0	0	62	0	69	2008-04-01	WOS:000255229600015	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Plant community composition was assessed by Detrended Correspondence Analysis and mean values of plant trait categories were calculated across the plots.Results: Differentiation of plant composition and community-wide plant trait characteristics was largely determined by grazing, soil acidity and their interaction. In ungrazed situations, a clear floristic distinction appears between acidic (non-calcareous) and alkaline (calcareous) grasslands. In grazed situations, these floristic differences largely disappeared, indicating that grazing results in a decrease of natural variation in species composition. At higher soil pH, a larger difference in plant community composition and community-wide plant traits was observed between grazed and ungrazed plots. In ungrazed situations, shifts in plant functional traits along the acidity gradient were observed.Conclusions: Grazing is responsible for shifts in plant community composition, and hence a decrease in plant diversity among grasslands at opposing acidity conditions in coastal dune grasslands. Therefore, care should be taken when introducing grazing as a system approach for nature conservation in dune grasslands as it may eliminate part of the natural variation in plant diversity along existing abiotic gradients."	19	1	0	0	20	0	21	2008-04-01	WOS:000255229600004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Correct evaluation of the exceedance of critical loads is fundamental for the long-term protection of ecosystems by limiting emissions of potential acidifying and eutrophying pollutants. For forest ecosystems, the exceedance of critical loads is often calculated using deposition data measured in the forest interior. However, several studies report forest edges acting as 'hotspots' of acidifying and nitrogen deposition, showing up to four-fold increases in atmospheric deposition compared to the forest interior. This paper estimates the relevance of considering the higher deposition load in forest edges for calculating exceedance of critical loads for nitrogen and potential acidifying deposition. If measures to control and reduce atmospheric deposition are based on mean deposition fluxes within forest stands, deposition reductions will not be enough for preventing adverse effects. In fact, emission reductions should be adjusted to deposition values at the forest edge, since these zones are most threatened. We thus conclude that there is an urgent need to reconsider the calculation of exceedance of critical loads, taking into account edge enhancement of deposition. This is an issue of high relevance, particularly in highly fragmented regions, such as Flanders (Belgium)."	31	0	0	0	28	0	33	2007-08-01	WOS:000247766700017	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is there any post-dispersal positive effect of the exotic shrub Pyracantha angustifolia on the success of Ligustrum lucidum seedlings, as compared to the effect of the native Condalia montana or the open herbaceous patches between shrubs? 2. Is the possible facilitation by Pyracantha and/or Condalia related to differential emergence, growth, or survival of Ligustrum seedlings under their canopies?Location: Cordoba, central Argentina.Methods: We designed three treatments. in which ten mature individuals of Pvracantha, ten of the dominant native shrub Condalia montana, and ten patches without shrub cover were involved. In each treatment we planted seeds and saplings of Ligustrum collected from nearby natural populations. Seedlings emerging from the planted seeds were harvested after one year to measure growth. Survival of the transplanted saplings was recorded every two month during a year. Half of the planted seeds and transplanted saplings were cage-protected from rodents.Results: Ligustrum seedling emergence did not differ among treatments while growth was significantly higher in the absence of shrub cover. Sapling survival was significantly higher under the canopy of Pyracantha, intermediate under Condalia. and lowest in the absence of shrub cover. Caging did not affect Growth but enhanced seedling emergence and sapling survival.Conclusion: The differential sapling survival in the shrub canopy treatments is consistent with natural sapling distribution. Pyracantha and, less so, Condalia, has a nurse-plant effect on Ligustrum. This results from contrasting effects of the shrubs on different stages of the life cycle of Ligustrum: no effect on seedling emergence, negative on seedling growth, and positive on sapling survival. This suggests that efforts to control the expansion of Ligustrum over the landscape should tackle Pvracantha as well."	38	2	0	0	40	5	44	2007-08-01	WOS:000247766700007	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Our main questions were: (1) what is the importance of sediment deposition and denitrification for plant productivity and nutrient retention in floodplains; (2) will rehabilitation of natural floodplain communities (semi-natural grassland, reedbed, woodland, pond) from agricultural grassland affect nutrient retention?Location: Floodplains of two Rhine distributaries (rivers IJssel and Waal), The Netherlands.Methods: Net sedimentation was measured using mats, denitrification in soil cores by acetylene inhibition and biomass production by clipping above-ground vegetation in winter and summer. Results: Sediment deposition was a major source of N and P in all floodplain communities. Highest deposition rates were found where water velocity was reduced by vegetation structure (reedbeds) or by a drop in surface elevation (pond). Sediment deposition was not higher in woodlands than in grassland types. Denitrification rates were low in winter but significantly higher in summer. Highest denitrification rates were found in an agricultural grassland (winter and summer) and in the ponds (summer). Plant productivity and nutrient uptake were high in reedbeds, intermediate in agricultural grasslands, ponds and semi-natural grasslands and very low in woodlands (only understorey). All wetlands were N-limited, which could be explained by low N:P ratios in sediment.Conclusions: Considering Rhine water quality: only substantial P-retention is expected because, relative to the annual nutrient loads in the river, the floodplains are important sinks for P, but much less for N. Rehabilitation of agricultural grasslands into ponds or reedbeds will probably be more beneficial for downstream water quality (lower P-concentrations) than into woodlands or semi-natural grasslands."	121	3	0	0	97	3	140	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

Are sowing date and cutting regime important in determining success? Location: Aberdeen and Elgin. northeast Scotland, United Kingdom. Methods: A field experiment was conducted at two sites to assess the effect of seed addition, sowing date and cutting regime on the vegetation developing on former arable land. the aim being to compare the success of different treatments at producing a species-rich grassland. Results: Sowing a seed mix resulted in the establishment of vegation very distinct from the species-poor vegetation dominated by perennial grasses which otherwise developed, though establishment success of the sown grassland species was highly variable between sites. Where establishment of the sown species was poor. sowing date had no significant effect on species composition, whereas the cutting regime was very important. Cutting the vegetation significantly increased both the number and abundance of sown species compared with the uncut control. Conversely, where establishment had been good, the cutting regime in the first year had little effect on species composition. Cutting the vegetation at least twice a year appeared to be the most effective management over the length of the experiment. Conclusions: Sowing a seed mixture significantly reduced the abundance and number of naturally colonising species, effectively controlling problem weed species such as Senecio jacobaea and Cirsium vidgare, highlighting the agronomic value of sowing seed mixtures on fallow farmland. The sowing of a seed mix on former arable land has demonstrated that it is feasible to create vegetation similar in character to that of species-rich grasslands."	4	0	0	0	4	0	4	2004-11-01	BCI:BCI200500082088	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Macroclimate (mean annual temperature and precipitation) significantly influenced the course of succession, which led to a formation of shrubby grassland, shrubby woodland or tall woodland. Participation of target species typical of steppe-like communities significantly depended on the occurrence of the communities in the vicinity, up to a distance of 30 m from a quarry.

Today. nearly all of these meadows have been abandoned and became rapidly overgrown by deciduous shrub and tree species forming a closed canopy which resulted in a rapid and strong decrease in species numbers of the herb layer. Recent efforts aim to restore overgrown wooded meadows by cutting single shrubs and trees to open the canopy. However, the effects of abandonment as well as of any restoration management in wooded meadows have rarely been documented until now. Mechanisms driving succession after restoration such as the dispersal potential of the respective species over time and space have not been analysed yet. Therefore, a chronosequence was studied which included a traditionally managed wooded meadow, an overgrown meadow which has been abandoned for more that) 100 yr and a meadow which was restored 36 yr ago by cutting and is now grazed. We analysed the soil seed bank of the 3 meadows in comparison with the established vegetation and endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep, After abandonment 87% of the typical grassland species vanished from the established vegetation and were replaced by species characteristic of woodland and disturbed grassland communities. The mean number of species decreased from 52 species per plot (4 m(2)) to 18 species. Mean species number and number of seeds in the seed bank declined significantly from the traditionally managed to the overgrown meadow. Most of the grassland species were assigned to a transient seed bank type while only 1/3 could be classified as having a short-term persistent seed bank. Thus. restoration of wooded meadows cannot rely on the soil seed bank. Endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep was shown for 15% of the species with seed densities per 100 g air dried dung of 737 and 767. respectively. Movement of animals between ancient and restored wooded meadows is recommended since many of the species only occurred in low densities and therefore, will probably not be found in the dung samples."	75	0	0	0	62	0	82	2002-05-01	WOS:000176407800007	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Adaptative multi- paddock grazing regimes, where grazing alternates with long periods of vegetation recovery, have been proposed as a more biodiversity-friendly management compared with continuous grazing. This study aimed to compare the effect of these two different grazing regimes on a set of plant traits in mediterranean grassland vegetation over time. Location: Central part of Sardinia (Italy) at 350 m a.s.l. in a permanent grassland system. Methods: We applied the point quadrat method to quantify the specific contribution of each species along permanent transects in spring and winter from 2018 to 2022. We considered the following plant traits: leaf dry matter content, life forms, flower-ing start and length of flowering. Overall, we performed 128 surveys and measured traits for 61 species. We ran a linear mixed model to test the effect of season, grazing regimes and years on functional diversity and community-weighted mean for single traits. Results: Adaptative multi- paddock regimes over time increased the leaf dry matter content. However, compared with grazing regimes, seasonality through time had the greatest effect on flowering traits and life forms. Conclusion: The relatively small variation in the plant traits suggests that the mediterranean grassland was rather stable despite wide variation in grazing regimes, probably linked to their long history of human association. Nonetheless, adaptative multi- paddock regimes may have higher beneficial effects compared with continuous grazing, favouring more palatable species and improving soil fertility. By contrast, the high variation in the plant traits over time suggests a high vulnerability of the same grassland to climatic changes"	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2024-09-30	WOS:001319920600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Our goal was to analyze the variation in both functional composition and functional diversity of plant communities under goat grazing and at different ages of fallow in a tropical dry forest. Location: Brazilian dry forest (Caatinga) in Rio Grande do Norte State, northeastern Brazil. Methods: We measured the height, leaf area, and specific leaf area of all shrub-tree and herbaceous species along a gradient of stocking rate, years of grazing, and age of fallow. Additionally, we quantified the foliar contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, and tannins in the tree shrub layer. We tested the effects of grazing and deforestation using linear mixed models. Results: Our findings suggest that the functional diversity of plant communities in the Caatinga is not altered when goat grazing and secondary succession are examined independently. However, the interaction of both factors has affected the functional diversity, particularly in the herbaceous layer. Although grazing influenced specific traits in the shrub-tree layer, the overall functional diversity remained unaltered by grazing, succession, or their interaction. Conclusions: Grazing does not interfere with the natural succession process nor diminish the functional diversity of plant communities in the Caatinga. Therefore, with appropriate management, grazing can coexist with the conservation goals of the Caatinga."	3	0	0	0	1	0	3	2024-05-27	WOS:001227092700001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We asked which plant communities have the greatest plant biodiversity and soil carbon storage and the best-performing nutrient cycles and water regulation.Location: Madrid City (Central Spain).Methods: We studied four types of plant communities following soil disturbance gradients: vegetation on trampled soils, roadside vegetation, annual grasslands and perennial forbs. Regarding vegetation, we studied plant composition and productivity, plant diversity, plant growth forms and functional groups. Regarding soils, we determined soil organic carbon (TOC), available nutrients, the activity of seven enzymes relating to the main macronutrient cycles, and physical properties such as bulk density (BD) and soil water-holding capacity (WHC). We used one-way ANOVA to determine the influence of the plant community type on both soil and vegetation variables. Canonical correspondence analysis was performed to interpret the relationships between plant species assemblages with environmental gradients.Results: Perennial forbs showed greater biomass and developed on soils with the greatest TOC and available phosphorus. Annual grasslands displayed the highest plant diversity. Roadside vegetation developed on soils with higher phenoloxidase activity when compared to vegetation on trampled soils and annual grasslands. Vegetation on trampled soils developed on soils with lower WHC, lower beta-glucosidase, arylamidase and phosphatase activities and higher BD when compared to perennial forbs. Plant community distribution followed gradients most significantly associated with soil organic matter content, soil compaction and nutrient cycling performance.Conclusions: We conclude that plant communities are good indicators of ecosystem function and services which are unevenly distributed throughout urban habitats. The management in Mediterranean unmaintained urban greenspaces should be aimed at avoiding soil compaction to promote biodiversity, carbon storage and water regulation."	13	0	0	0	8	0	13	2023-09-25	WOS:000994035400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In this study, after 25 years we resurveyed a total of 145 grassland releves from the mid-1990s in a grassland-dominated valley of the Northern Alps of Upper Austria. We studied changes in richness and composition, and related these to underlying drivers. We found that the average species number in plots increased from 46 in the first survey period to 49 in the second one. Median species richness across sites significantly increased from 1995 to 2020 for Festuco-Brometea (55-61 species) and Galio-Urticetea (24-32 species), but did not show any significant change for the other classes. Further, we recorded substantial species turnover, with winners consisting mostly of species that prefer nutrient-rich sites, while losers were predominantly species of nutrient-poor sites. In particular, using Ellenberg Indicator Values for calculating community indices, we found an indication for ongoing eutrophication in vegetation types of nutrient-poor vegetation classes (Festuco-Brometea and Calluno-Ulicetea), and in wet habitats (Scheuchzerio-Caricetea fuscae). Community indices of wet habitats also showed clear signs of becoming more mesic. Thermophilization of community indices was evident across several vegetation classes. Further, alien species that were very rare in the mid-1990s became more abundant in the resurveyed plots, although the level of invasion is still low. Finally, community values for nutrients of plots that are located in a protected area that has been established in 2014 did not increase significantly, while this was the case in plots outside the protected area, indicating that the management of the protected area has positive effects in halting eutrophication. We conclude that despite overall species richness changing only moderately between both surveys, substantial changes in community composition toward more nitrophilic and thermophilic conditions occurred."	8	0	0	0	7	0	9	2023-01-01	WOS:000899162300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The potential causes of the decline were explored by analysing the response of lichen cover to forest management, site and stand variables as well as co-existing plants in different boreal vegetation subzones. Location Finland. Methods Understorey vegetation was surveyed on a systematic network of 1721 sample plots in forests on mineral soil. The response of macrolichen cover to explanatory variables was analysed by generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). Results Ground lichens favoured old Pinus sylvestris forests on xeric sites with sufficient light conditions. Intensive forest management regimes, such as regeneration cutting and soil ploughing decreased lichen cover, while lighter scarification methods had less effect on lichens. Lichens benefitted from intermediate cutting on sites with low bryophyte cover. Lichens responded similarly to site and stand variables in all boreal subzones, showing that despite heavy reindeer grazing these response patterns apply also in the northern boreal subzone. Lichens showed both negative (Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum and Calluna vulgaris) and positive (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) responses to increasing dwarf shrub cover. Generally, lichens negatively responded to increasing bryophyte cover, indicating either that bryophytes benefit from a decline of lichens or that there is real competition between these groups. The negative relationship between bryophytes and lichens strengthened as the tree canopy becomes denser. Conclusions Our study provides new quantitative insights into the effects of forest management and changes in forest structure as underlying factors for lichen decline both inside and outside the reindeer-herding area (i.e., the northern boreal subzone). These factors include increased canopy cover with increased shading as well as disturbance caused by regeneration cutting and soil preparation. The possible effects of the long-term legacy of nitrogen deposition, lack of forest fires and climate change are also discussed."	8	0	0	0	7	0	8	2022-11-16	WOS:000878130300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The typical vegetation of calcareous grasslands, which are biodiversity hotspots in Europe, reportedly even profits from droughts. What was the response of their vegetation, considering different species groups, to the recent periods of intense summer droughts? How did differences in microclimate, such as between steep, south-facing slopes (SSF) and flat or north-facing slopes (FNF), affect species composition and drought response? Location Semi-arid calcareous grasslands (Mesobromion) in northwest Germany. Methods In 2019, we resurveyed 112 vegetation plots from 25 sites first established in 2008, after 11 exceptionally dry years. Species identities and cover were assessed in plots of 1 m(2). We used linear mixed models to determine the effect of microclimate on species composition and drought response. Vegetation changes were visualised by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Results In the initial survey in 2008, the species composition was significantly influenced by the microclimate, with positive effects of dry and warm conditions on SSF on character species. Phosphorus availability played an equally important, albeit contrasting, role. Vegetation change between 2008 and 2019 showed strong signs of the severe droughts. On SSF slopes, total species richness decreased, with negative trends for all species groups except ruderal species. Remarkably, this also affected the character species of dry grasslands. By contrast, dry conditions on FNF favoured an increase in total species richness and character species. However, eutrophication indicators increased here as well. Conclusions We conclude that sites with a dry and warm microclimate have to date had a positive, stabilising effect on the typical vegetation of calcareous grasslands.

Nowadays, this ecosystem is threatened by the afforestation by monocultures, such as Pinus spp., leading to serious damage to native herbaceous species. Afforestation of savanna ecosystems can affect their ability to regenerate naturally, which relies on different strategies, such as resprouting from below-ground bud-bearing organs. Therefore, we investigated the impact of ca. 50 years of Pinus elliottii plantations, compared to undisturbed areas of Cerrado savanna, estimating the bud bank size by counting buds on bud-bearing organs. We hypothesized that long-term P. elliottii plantations negatively affected the bud-bearing organs, leading to decreases in the bud bank.Location Cerrado savanna areas and Pinus elliottii plantations, southeastern Brazil.Methods Open savanna areas (hereafter Cerrado) and P. elliottii plantations were considered the vegetation types. Within each vegetation type, we designated three areas. In each area, we established 10 plots (1 m(2)). For each plot, the bud bank was sampled from 5 cm above to 10 cm below ground level in subplots (0.25 m(2)). We developed generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) for each response variable to test differences between both vegetation types.Results The presence of the P. elliottii plantations for almost 50 years has led to massive reductions in the bud bank size and the number of bud-bearing organs, when compared to the Cerrado areas (p < 0.0001).Conclusions The reduction in the below-ground bud-bearing organs density led to decreases in the bud bank and thus, loss of resilience in these areas. Regeneration in planting areas may not occur naturally after the removal of the plantations. Restoration of the herbaceous layer after P. elliottii removal will rely on the introduction of a new source of propagules through active interventions."	15	0	0	0	13	1	15	2020-11-17	WOS:000583952600001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We also investigated how compositional responses depended on traits expected to influence individual success.Location: Forest restoration sites across anthropogenic grasslands in mixed use agricultural watersheds, eastern Sao Paulo state, Brazil.Methods: We identified and measured all woody individuals (DBH >= 5 cm) in four 200-m(2) plots per site. Then we translated these measurements into above-ground biomass (AGB), and related AGB variability to neighbouring forest cover, soil texture and chemical fertility using mixed effect models. We assessed the effect of these predictors on different species groups, arranged according to variation in wood density, tree height or habitat selectivity, through multivariate abundance models.Results: GB ranged between 0 and 104.7 t/ha (median of 10.4 t/ha), with high variation within, as well as between, watersheds. Sand percentage, forest cover and the interaction between soil nutrient concentrations and sand percentage were good predictors of measured AGB. The most parsimonious model projected a seven growing seasons AGB recovery of 70.90 t/ha, when a site is on fertile soils with 10% sand and surrounded by forest cover of 50%. In contrast, only 5.24 t/ha is predicted on acidic-poor soils with 67% sand and 0% forest cover. Increasing forest cover favoured smaller trees and habitat generalists while increasing sand percentage inhibited taller species and forest specialists. Sand percentage constrained softwoods in fertile soils.Conclusion: Our results confirm that the likelihood of restoration to pre-disturbance conditions is constrained in contexts of higher degradation, such as when agricultural use adversely affects soil properties and/or motivates extreme deforestation. Lower AGB found on sandy soils suggests that forest recovery is sensitive to local drought intensification. Given regional projections for extended dry seasons, restoration approaches could consider targeting alternative reference states, rather than historical/undisturbed ones, under highly altered environments, while aiming to improve soil and microclimate conditions to allow moist tropical forest recovery where feasible."	23	0	0	0	16	0	24	2018-12-28	WOS:000430912500002	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We calculated and compared functional dissimilarity distances, amounts of species and accumulated abundance of pollination modes, and functional indices of richness and evenness between forest types.ResultsFunctional dissimilarity distances were much smaller than species dissimilarity distances within forest types (mean <20%, >80%, respectively), indicating a small variation in pollination modes between sites. Functional indices of richness and evenness did not differ between forest types. However, significant changes were found in the species and abundance proportions of several pollination modes. Primary forests were characterized by the predominance of generalized insect-pollinated species, followed by secondary proportions of bee, wind and moth pollination; other pollination modes were underrepresented. In restored forests, reductions were found in generalized insect, moth, wind, fly, pollen-consuming insect and very-small insect pollination, whereas the species pollinated by bees and bats more than doubled. Smaller changes were found among secondary forests, including reductions in moth, fly and fig-wasp pollination, whereas there were incremental changes in bee, beetle, big animal and small insect pollination.ConclusionsOur results indicate a rather stable assemblage of pollination modes and also high ecological redundancy among trees regardless of the species replacement at the regional scale. Major changes among restored forests are probably in response to larger disturbance effects and/or restoration practices conducted in these sites. In contrast, smaller changes among secondary forests could be in response to smaller disturbance effects and natural selection processes, and also seem to suggest that highly resilient degraded areas are more likely to recuperate their functional diversity through natural regeneration alone. In both cases, however, efforts to recover such patterns should be encouraged to avoid possible negative effects in plant-pollinator interactions."	9	0	0	0	9	1	10	2018-03-13	WOS:000425120600017	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Worldwide, many Juniperus species are threatened due to their failure to regenerate. We focus on Juniperus communis in areas of NW Europe where it is declining and ask: what advice is available to land managers on natural regeneration methods, and when applied, how effective has this been?MethodsWe synthesize knowledge on the efficacy of management interventions and conditions associated with J.communis regeneration. In field trials, we test interventions where knowledge is lacking. We assess regeneration of J.communis, creation of regeneration microsites and germination of sown seed in response to the interventions.ResultsAlthough J.communis occurs in different habitats, there is consistency in site conditions important for regeneration (unshaded/open, short ground vegetation, disturbed/bare ground, low herbivore pressure). In calcareous grasslands, areas with regeneration are stony/bare or vegetation is short or sparse; in upland acid grasslands and dry heathlands regeneration locations are disturbed areas sometimes with a moss cover. Several interventions (grazing, scarification, turf stripping) can create regeneration conditions. The synthesis identified cattle grazing and ground scarification for further testing on upland acid grasslands. In the resulting field trials, regeneration was rare and recorded on only one cattle-grazed site. An exposed moss layer characterized regeneration microsites but there was insufficient evidence that either intervention increased regeneration microsite frequency. Few sown seeds germinated.ConclusionsDifferent interventions or intensities of these appear to be required depending on habitat type. Broadly, on calcareous grassland intense scarification or soil stripping is needed, while on dry heathlands light scarification is suitable. On upland acid grassland, cattle grazing and ground scarification do not reliably result in regeneration. Creation of favourable mossy regeneration microsites is unlikely following intervention, unless soil fertility is low. Land-use change, increased climate warming and pollution are pressures acting on J.communis and may cause habitat loss and altered site conditions (e.g. soil fertility), making it difficult to create regeneration microsites at all J.communis sites. Other constraints on regeneration may operate (e.g. seed predation and low seed viability) and managers should assess population and site potential before undertaking management."	19	0	0	0	17	0	20	2017-07-04	WOS:000403676000009	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We tested the theoretical expectation that certain functional traits can explain vegetation changes along gradients of productivity and soil moisture in response to these land-use changes.Location: Zelezne hory Mts., Czech Republic, Central Europe.Methods: We set up a long-term experiment where we applied a full factorial design of fertilization and abandonment to 17 traditionally mown wet meadows covering a broad range of productivity and soil moisture conditions found within the region. Plant functional traits that cover different aspects of plant ecological strategies-plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), seed mass and clonality-were used to explain both species and whole community response to land-use change. We employed linear mixed effect models to test for the consistency of functional changes across different productivity and soilmoisture conditions.Results: We found that the functional response of species and whole communities to land-use change was consistent across meadows differing substantially in their productivity and soil moisture. Specifically, irrespective of the local conditions, both fertilization and abandonment selected for tall species within communities, highlighting the effect of increased competition for light. Traits related to a more exploitative strategy in species (higher SLA, more prominent clonal growth and smaller seeds) were consistently favoured with increased fertilization.Conclusions: We show that within a given region with a common land-use history, certain functional traits consistently explain and can help to predict changes in plant communities caused by land-use change, irrespective of different productivity and soil moisture conditions. Our results demonstrate a simple way to use functional traits in applied nature conservation. We hope this will encourage practitioners to use functional traits to complement existing knowledge on composition and productivity of considered habitats to enhance the planning of management practices. We encourage practitioners to build regional trait databases to actively use trait information for the purpose of habitat management."	6	0	0	0	4	0	7	2016-06-01	WOS:000374545600004	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We asked: (1) how does functional richness (FRic) differ between the five predominant grassland types in Andorra (2) of these five grassland types, which plant communities are subject to high habitat filtering and which are driven primarily by competitive interactions; (3) are certain grassland communities more prone to degradation than others; and (4) how do grazing intensity and elevation influence variations in FD indices?Locations: Five types of sub-alpine and alpine grassland communities dominated by Festuca airoides, F.eskia, F.gautieri, F.paniculata and Nardus stricta in Andorra, at various elevations and with differing grazing intensities within a grassland type.Methods: We used multiple functional diversity indices and structural equation modelling (SEM) to determine how grazing intensity, elevation, species richness and productivity affect functional diversity in 222 vegetation transects.Results: Both plant diversity and functional richness were higher at higher grazing intensities, with the highest values found in the F.gautieri and F.paniculata grasslands and lowest in the Nardus stricta, F.airoides and F.eskia grasslands. Habitat filtering was observed in F.airoides grasslands. There was a general tendency for higher competitive interactions among plants at higher elevations and/or when species diversity increased. None of the five grassland communities considered appears disturbed, and all present similar functional attributes between dominant species.Conclusions: Our results highlight the fact that grazing is an integral part of Andorran mountain grasslands, acting as a structural component and providing higher functional richness in the most grazed communities."	28	6	0	0	26	0	34	2014-12-31	WOS:000345761800009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Mowing is expensive and grazing can be difficult to achieve and maintain for logistical reasons. Is annual spring burning, which is potentially cheaper than mowing and grazing, a viable management tool for species-rich grasslands?Location: Long-term field trials in 11 grasslands in southern Sweden.Methods: We calculated the odds for a species being an indicator of good management, an indicator of poor management, or an indicator of nitrogen influence in spring-burned plots, grazed plots and annually mowed plots. Odds ratios contrasting spring-burned plots with grazed plots and spring-burned plots with mowed plots were subjected to meta-analyses in which we compared the odds ratios after 1, 8 and 14 spring burns. For a single trial, we also analysed data after 1, 8, 14, 28 and 39 spring burns.Results: Compared with mowed and grazed plots, the odds of the four different indicators of good management decreased in spring-burned plots, while the odds for the two indicators of poor management increased. There was no trend in the two indicators of excess nitrogen. Therefore, the conservation value of vegetation in spring-burned plots becomes reduced over time relative to traditional management.Conclusions: Spring burning is not an appropriate long-term management method if the aim is to maintain the conservation value of the vegetation in traditionally managed semi-natural grasslands."	22	0	0	0	22	0	26	2014-07-16	WOS:000337725300007	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Elkhead Watershed, Colorado, US. Methods Current model-building efforts use species composition to define changes in ecosystem state, but plant traits may offer a faster and more broadly applicable alternative. We (1) compare states defined by species composition to those defined by trait-based groups of differing complexity and (2) determine how management and environmental site characteristics relate to species- and trait group-defined states. We sampled 72 plots with different grazing and chemical shrub treatment histories on two soil types. We measured plant species composition in each plot and categorized species into trait groups using three classification schemes, which represented increasing numbers of traits and levels of classification complexity. The classifications employed easily measured traits that affect plant response to range management: life form, life history, resprouting ability, height, vegetative reproduction and N-fixation. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified states with similar species or trait group composition. We explored relationships between each set of potential states and management history and environmental factors using logistic regression. Results Trait-based group composition and species composition identified many of the same potential states and responses to grazing and chemical shrub treatment. Relationships between species and trait group composition and management and environmental characteristics differed on the two soil types. Species composition was sensitive to more different management practices, on average, than trait group composition. Trait group composition revealed some relationships to management and environmental drivers that were not detected using species composition. Conclusion This study confirms that species composition is a more sensitive indicator of sagebrush steppe response to range management, and some information is lost with a trait-based approach. However, traits also add to depth of understanding by revealing additional community patterns related to different drivers. Using the most complex trait grouping scheme that is feasible in a particular study, and also looking for patterns based on simpler trait groups, will provide the most complete understanding of sagebrush steppe response to range management."	5	0	0	0	5	1	5	2013-07-10	WOS:000319885000002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Can we assess how it may conflict with grassland diversity hotspots? Location Western Swiss Alps (4003210m a.s.l.). Methods We used statistical models to predict the location of land abandonment by farmers that is followed by forest regrowth in semi-natural grasslands of the Western Swiss Alps. Six modelling methods (GAM, GBM, GLM, RF, MDA, MARS) allowing binomial distribution were tested on two successive transitions occurring between three time periods. Models were calibrated using data on land-use change occurring between 1979 and 1992 as response, and environmental, accessibility and socio-economic variables as predictors, and these were validated for their capacity to predict the changes observed from 1992 to 2004. Projected probabilities of land-use change from an ensemble forecast of the six models were combined with a model of plant species richness based on a field inventory, allowing identification of critical grassland areas for the preservation of biodiversity. Results Models calibrated over the first land-use transition period predicted the second transition with reasonable accuracy. Forest regrowth occurs where cultivation costs are high and yield potential is low, i.e. on steeper slopes and at higher elevations. Overlaying species richness with land-use change predictions, we identified priority areas for the management and conservation of biodiversity at intermediate elevations. Conclusions Combining land-use change and biodiversity projections, we propose applied management measures for targeted/identified locations to limit the loss of biodiversity that could otherwise occur through loss of open habitats. The same approach could be applied to other types of land-use changes occurring in other ecosystems."	36	0	0	0	22	0	40	2013-04-01	WOS:000315690500008	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Two inland dune reserves in The Netherlands with low and high N deposition. Methods During 2.5 yr, N and P addition (control, N, P, NP) took place in three different vegetation types of inland dunes (Polytrichum piliferum mats, Campylopus introflexus mats and lichen-dominated vegetation). In each site, changes in the vegetation were recorded in three replicate quadrats of 1 m x 1 m per treatment. Differences in element content of grasses and lichens were recorded, together with vegetation parameters, including cover and height of grasses, bryophytes and lichens. Results In the site with high N deposition, grasses were taller, had higher N:P ratios and a generally lower lichen cover than in the low-deposition area. Experimental N application resulted in higher N and lower base metal concentrations in grasses and an increase in grass cover and size. In contrast, lichens showed a general decline in the N treatment and the lichen:grass ratio decreased. The effect of N addition was larger in the low-deposition area. The P treatment had an opposite effect: lichens increased in size and cover and overgrew grasses, especially when reindeer lichens were present. This suggests that the cryptogam layer was P-limited even in the low N deposition site. Conclusions Pioneer vegetation in inland dunes is susceptible to N and P addition. The results provide evidence for a decrease in lichen cover due to increased N deposition."	10	0	0	0	9	0	11	2013-02-14	WOS:000312159400006	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Gradients in the cover of species indicative of wet and dry conditions, as well as bog recovery and degradation in relation to distance from drain, were compared from a sample of drains at two sites with blocked drains and two with unblocked drains.Results: There was evidence for drain-blocking having a negative effect on vegetation indicative of drier conditions and bog degradation. One of the blocked sites had the lowest values of these indices near to the drain and increasing at greater distances perpendicular from the drain. The two unblocked sites, and the other blocked site, had a contrasting pattern of highest values of these indices close to the drain declining with distance. Cover of species indicative of bog recovery was greater where the drains had been blocked for the longest time.Conclusions: In some cases drain-blocking can improve the ecological functioning of blanket bogs by increasing cover of healthy bog vegetation.

This method does not require any arbitrarily set sward-height thresholds to discriminate between grazed and ungrazed areas, or the use of additional variables such as defoliation indexes. The model was validated by comparing empirical and simulated sward-height distributions and semi-variograms.Results: The model discriminated between grazed and ungrazed patches at both a fine (1 m(2)) and a larger (500 m(2)) scale. Selective grazing on legumes and forbs and avoidance of reproductive grass could partly explain the stability of fine-scale grazing patterns in lightly grazed plots. In these plots, the model revealed an inter-annual stability of large-scale grazing patterns at the time peak biomass occurred. At the end of the grazing season, lightly grazed plots showed fluctuating patch boundaries while heavily grazed plots showed a certain degree of patch stability.Conclusion: The model presented here reveals that selective grazing at the bite scale could lead to the creation of relatively stable patches within the pasture.

Which are the interactive effects of small-scale disturbances, successional stage and year-to-year variation on early establishment probabilities of C. canescens?LocationBrandenburg, NE Germany.MethodsWe measured emergence and survival rates over 3 yr in a sowing-experiment conducted in three successional stages (C. canescens-dominated site, ruderal forb site and pioneer forest) under two different regimes of mechanical ground disturbance (disturbed versus undisturbed control).ResultsOverall, disturbance led to higher emergence in a humid year and to lower emergence in a very dry year. Apparently, when soil moisture was sufficient, the main factor limiting C. canescens' establishment was competition, while in the dry year, water became the limiting factor. Survival rates were not affected by disturbance. In humid years, C. canescens emerged in higher numbers in open successional stages while in the dry year, emergence rates were higher in late stages, suggesting an important role of late successional stages for the persistence of C. canescens.ConclusionsOur results suggest that small-scale disturbances can promote germination of C. canescens. However, disturbances should be carefully planned. The optimal strategy for promoting C. canescens is to apply disturbances just before seed dispersal and not during dry years. At the landscape scale, a mosaic of different vegetation types is beneficial for the protected pioneer grass as facilitation by late-successional species may be an important mechanism for the persistence of C. canescens, especially in dry years."	9	0	0	0	10	0	11	2010-08-01	WOS:000279438400007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Changes in species richness and composition were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank tests, principal component analysis and partial redundancy analyses (pRDA). We also used pRDA and an indicator species analysis to determine which species had undergone the greatest changes over time.

We studied the initial vegetation recovery under two management approaches: natural recovery and prescribed burning. We hypothesized that natural recovery will be slower in more drought-affected sites, whereas burning will facilitate post-fire recovery in all sites by effectively removing dead and damaged heath. Both natural recovery and post-fire succession will be slower in the north.Location: Calluna heath in seven sites spanning an approx. 600-km latitudinal gradient along the coast of Norway (60.22-65.69(degrees)N).Methods: After a natural drought, 10 permanent plots per site were either burnt or left for natural recovery. Vegetation data were recorded annually in 2016 (pre-fire) and 2017-2019 (post-fire) reflecting a factorial repeated-measures design (n = 280). The data were analyzed using mixed-effects models.Results: Two years after the drought, we observed high but variable Calluna damage and mortality. Over the four years of study, damaged Calluna recovered, whereas dead Calluna showed little recovery. Both the extent of the damage and mortality, as well as the rate of natural recovery, are only weakly related to site climate or environmental factors. Fire efficiently removed dead and damaged Calluna and facilitated post-fire successional dynamics and recovery in a majority of sites.Conclusions: Extreme winter drought resulted in substantial and often persistent damage and dieback on Calluna along the latitudinal gradient. In sites with high mortality, prescribed burning removed the dead biomass and, in some cases, facilitated vegetation recovery. Traditional heathland management, which uses burning to facilitate all-year grazing by Old Norse sheep in Atlantic coastal heathlands, can be an efficient tool to mitigate dieback events and more generally to increase resistance to and resilience after extreme drought events in the future."	2	0	0	0	1	0	2	2023-12-30	WOS:001126579200001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The species richness of hay meadows protected within the Natura 2000 network is often endangered by high levels of fertilisation and relatedly, increased cutting frequency, which leads to decreased light availability for small plants and seedlings at ground level. The purpose of this study is to analyse how management practices and the interaction of fertilisation and cutting regime affect light distribution in grassland canopies as well as the growth of small plants.LocationSouth Germany.MethodsThis was investigated by measuring the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and dry matter yield (DMY) of the first growth cycle over 2 years at two sites of a 5-year-old hay meadow trial. To calculate the relative light intensity, PAR was measured above the canopy and at ground level. Two factors, fertilisation (none, PK, NPK) and date of first cut (based on phenological stages), were manipulated.ResultsOur results show that the date of the first cut had no influence on light availability during the first growth cycle, whereas fertilisation decreased light availability for small plants due to a denser canopy. Fertilisation increased the DMY of the first growth cycle significantly. We show that NPK fertilisation (35 kg N, 35 kg P2O5 and 120 kg K2O ha(-1) a(-1)) decreased both the number and proportion of small plant species.ConclusionNPK fertilisation can lead to a loss of biodiversity. These results are of relevance for the improvement and management of species-rich hay meadows. Because of its effect on competition for light, the supply of plant-available nitrogen is a key driver in obtaining or restoring biodiversity in species-rich hay meadows. Therefore, careful site-adapted fertilisation is a basic requirement in maintaining the ecological value of grassland."	7	0	0	0	4	0	7	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Furthermore, we discuss how their interplay may affect the conservation of semi-natural grasslands. Location Rhon Mountains, central Europe. Methods Plant material from mowers (n = 12 from one date) and dung samples from migratory sheep (n = 39 from 13 dates) were collected and the dispersed plant species were determined using the emergence method. We compared the species compositions to the regional above-ground vegetation and seed bank using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and indicator species analysis. Furthermore, we compared functional traits of the dispersed species to traits of non-dispersed species of the regional species pools by calculating log-response ratios and performing metaregressions. Results While 43 species were shared between the vectors, the vegetation compositions differed from each other. Mower samples were more similar to the above-ground vegetation whereas dung samples were more similar to the seed bank. Mowers and sheep endozoochory favoured the dispersal of species with different traits and phenologies. Species with small seed sizes were prevalent in both vectors. Mowers were less selective concerning most traits, but favoured high-growing grasses such as Alopecurus pratensis and Trisetum flavescens. Sheep dung samples contained less grasses and more palatable species, such as Urtica dioica. Mowers were most selective concerning phenology, whereas endozoochory by migratory sheep also included late-flowering species. Conclusion Sheep endozoochory and mowing machinery are complementary dispersal vectors favouring species with differing functional traits. Sheep endozoochory enables dispersal of species that have unfavourable traits (e.g. low releasing heights) or phenologies for dispersal by mowing machinery. To ensure the dispersal of a high number of plant species in semi-natural grasslands, the interplay of different vectors should be considered."	8	0	0	0	7	0	8	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

What is the contribution of natives and exotics to swamp response to urbanization?Location Quebec City, Canada.Methods Plant communities of 34 swamps located in low, moderately or highly urbanized landscapes were sampled, and species classified into three exclusive groups: native wetland, native upland and exotic plants. Urbanization's influence on the richness of each plant group was assessed using mixed models. Between-site compositional similarities were calculated to identify variations in beta diversity with urbanization level using tests for homogeneity in multivariate dispersion. Beta diversity was further partitioned into species replacement and richness difference for each plant group. Finally, the relationships of ten environmental variables representing soil water saturation and microtopography with plant assemblages were determined by redundancy analysis.Results Although the richness of exotics increased with urbanization intensity, revealing increasing propagule pressure, it remained six to 27 times lower compared to the richness of natives, which remained stable with urbanization. On the other hand, beta diversity increased with urbanization, with higher dissimilarities in species composition between highly urbanized swamps than between low-urbanized ones. This pattern resulted from high species replacement among natives, while richness difference mainly contributed to exotic beta diversity. Changes in plant assemblages were mostly associated with bryophyte cover and soil drainage and red mottle size, suggesting that hydrological conditions likely acted as a strong driver of swamp plant community response to urbanization.Conclusions Swamp plant communities experienced biotic differentiation with increasing urbanization. This differentiation pattern likely was linked to the unpredictable effect of urbanization on hydrological regimes, which promoted high native turnover while limiting exotic spread. Long-term monitoring is recommended to ensure that exotics do not outcompete natives through time. Designing sustainable cities requires a greater understanding of the multifaceted effect of urbanization on biodiversity."	4	0	0	0	4	0	4	2020-12-29	WOS:000598108300001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Seed bank samples were characterized by seedling emergence and seed extraction methods.Results: Assay method influenced whether we detected a significant Pennisetum-removal treatment response on Pennisetum detected in the seed bank. A treatment response was not observed using the emergence method. Using the extraction method, we found that untreated Pennisetum plots contained significantly more Pennisetum seed than removal treatments. Treatments did not affect detection of native seed banks using either method. Microsite type only had an effect on seed detected using the emergence method, where more perennial species and seed densities were detected below shrubs. Native species richness and estimated seed densities using extraction were correlated with emergence results (r = 0.52, N = 42, p < 0.001 and r = 0.56; N = 42, p < 0.001, respectively).Conclusions: Results highlight several considerations for how different seed bank methods can influence interpretation of management treatments. Along with vegetation surveys, seed bank observations indicate that removal treatments successfully reduced Pennisetum in soil seed banks at invaded sites relative to invaded untreated sites. Natives were a significant proportion of seed banks, showing potential for native plants to establish after treatments of non-native plants. Results suggest potential to calibrate seed bank methods with each other to reconcile differences. Because viability of extracted seed was uncertain, further analysis may be necessary to test which assay method best predicts future vegetation."	8	1	0	0	7	0	10	2018-12-28	WOS:000450061000007	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

As part of a proposed accounting methodology for California's cap-and-trade system, we described five riparian vegetation associations and created a tool to predict their rates of carbon accumulation under different restoration and land-use scenarios.Location: California, USA.Methods: We assembled a database of 654 forest inventory plots of known age (3-108 years) from replanted and naturally recruiting California riparian forests. We then used detrended correspondence analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering to detect vegetation structure in the plots and delineate distinct forest types. We used allometric equations to estimate biomass from individual trees' diameters and calculate total biomass for each plot. Next, we fitted sigmoid growth functions to the plot biomass data to generate expected values for live-tree biomass over a 100-year period for each forest type. Finally, we created an algorithm to match user-inputted data for an intended restoration project with a look-up table that predicts carbon accumulation appropriate to the user's scenario.Results: California riparian vegetation was divided into willow scrub, cottonwood-willow, mixed riparian, upland riparian and riparian woodland types. Total carbon sequestration in riparian vegetation and soil varied from 75.7 to 137.4 Mg C/ha at 30 years post-restoration and from 95.1 to 175.8 Mg C/ha 100 years after stand initiation. Vegetation types dominated by taller, more shade-tolerant trees developed more slowly than scrubby and pioneer stands, but came to a higher maximum biomass. Our models put riparian biomass accumulation in the range of the few extant literature values for mediterranean systems, but uncertainties are high, and soil carbon may be underestimated.Conclusions: Our workflow and methods should be transferable to the development of carbon accounting tools for any other woody vegetation type. However, our difficulty in finding appropriate published data for the analysis suggests a critical need for field surveys appropriate to biomass estimation in woodland and forest communities not exploited for timber. The most important measurements are the age of the stand and a census of tree species, height and diameter."	37	1	0	0	19	0	42	2018-12-28	WOS:000450061000003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We asked whether native forbs in a temperate grassland were seed-limited, and how the recruitment of native and exotic forbs is affected by grassland structure and resource availability.Location: Australian Capital Territory, south-eastern Australia.Methods: We conducted a field experiment in a temperate grassland dominated by a native tussock grass to assess effects of: (1) addition of native forb seed, (2) thinning of native grass tussocks, (3) leaf litter removal, and (4) exotic plant removal on the recruitment of native and exotic forbs. These four actions can alter grassland structure and the availability of soil nutrients, soil moisture and light. We used GLMM to determine the importance of seed addition, grassland structure and resource availability on the richness and abundance of sown native forbs, and the abundance of exotic forb seedlings and unsown native forbs.Results: Adding seed increased the species richness and abundance of native forbs. Tussock thinning and litter removal increased species richness and abundance of sown native forbs, and the abundance of exotic forb seedlings. Exotic plant removal also increased the abundance of sown native forbs. Abundance of unsown native forb species was unaffected by the experimental treatments. Species richness and abundance of native forbs and abundance of exotic forbs declined with increasing tussock grass cover. Leaf litter restricted the abundance of native forb species more than exotic forb species.Conclusion: Native forb recruitment predominantly relied upon seed addition, suggesting that seed limitation is a major barrier to the recovery of degraded grasslands. Reducing the cover of living grass tussocks facilitated recruitment of native and exotic forbs, and removing litter disproportionally increased recruitment of native forbs compared with exotics. Combining seed addition with the reduction of both living and dead grass biomass should help restore native grassland forbs."	40	4	0	0	36	0	46	2018-12-28	WOS:000430912500006	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What are the causes of slow fen-meadow vegetation recovery on peat soils after topsoil removal?Location: Drentsche Aa Nature Reserve (53 degrees 0049N, 6 degrees 3746E) in the northeast Netherlands, with extensive natural and partially restored fen meadows (ca. 10,000ha).Methods: Restoration measures consisted of removal of acidified and fertilized topsoil and improvement of local hydrology by blocking or removing drainage ditches. The effects of shallow (20cm) and deep (40cm) topsoil removal were compared. We monitored vegetation changes after restoration measures in permanent plots over a 13-yr period, and analysed changes in species composition over time with ordination techniques (multivariate analysis: PCA and RDA). Soil conditions over time were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA.Results: The vegetation and environment shifted over time in response to restoration. At first the vegetation stagnated in a species-poor phase for 5yr, but eventually fen-meadow species re-established. At the end of the observation period, after 14yr, the vegetation after both shallow and deep peat removal was similar. Soil acidification occurred immediately after topsoil removal (within the first 2-3yr) due to pyrite oxidation when the soil was exposed to air after site excavation and the peat was temporarily desiccated.Conclusions: We found poor re-establishment of fen-meadow vegetation and persistence of species-poor communities during the first 5yr after topsoil removal, probably resulting from internal soil acidification. After further rewetting, a rapid shift towards the target community composition was observed. The positive shift in development of fen-meadow vegetation probably occurred due to increased groundwater discharge after successful hydrological measures were applied. Appropriate hydrological conditions (strong discharge of groundwater) are important for the success of restoration of these fen meadows, especially if pyrite is present in shallow soil layers."	16	2	0	0	13	0	19	2015-01-01	WOS:000345761800012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A simple test for alternative states in ecological restoration: the use of principal response curves	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	17	2	NA	NA	302	311	NA	10.1111/avsc.12054	Article	APR 2014	2014	"AimsEcological resistance and resilience and its link to alternative states is an important concept in ecological restoration. In many situations there is a need to flip one ecosystem state to another and then keep it there; thus there is a need to overcome the resistance/resilience of the starting community and create another one with sufficient resistance/resilience to maintain it in that state. The difficulty for ecological restoration is that these concepts are complicated to measure in practice, and hence tend to be discussed in rather abstract terms. Here, we describe the application of principal response curves (PRC) to test for the creation of alternative states or alternative stable states in ecological restoration studies.LocationSix experiments on acid grassland and heathland invaded by Pteridium aquilinum across Great Britain.MethodsWe use PRC, a multivariate approach, to measure change in ecological restoration experiments that allows a formal test of whether alternative states are created. We used PRC to test for change in plant species composition in a series of replicated experiments designed to change a late-successional ecosystem, dominated by P.aquilinum, into either heathland or acid grassland. Here, we tested three Pteridium control treatments, including two 'one-off' treatments (applied only at the start) and a 'repeated' (applied regularly) treatment, against an untreated experimental control.ResultsIn the heathland targets, alternative states were induced within 10yrs using the 'repeated' treatment (cutting twice per year). All 'one-off' treatments either did not overcome the resistance of the starting community or if they did, produced a temporary displacement, but the resilience of the initial state was too high and there was a rapid reversion to the starting community. In the grassland community, alternative states were induced by 'repeated' treatment (cutting twice per year), but the 'one-off' treatment suggested creation of an alternative stable state that lasted 10yrs.ConclusionsFor the first time, there is a methodology using PRC that tests for the creation of alternative states or alternative stable states in ecological restoration research. The drawback is that a long-term data set from replicated experiments with an untreated control treatment is needed."	25	0	0	0	21	0	26	2014-04-30	WOS:000332774800011	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) which forest layers are most affected by fire; (2) how is forest structure, species richness, diversity and composition affected by fire disturbance; and (3) does the forest recover after fire disturbance?Location: Kirindy Forest in Central Menabe, western Madagascar.Methods: We conducted our investigations in seven areas of the Kirindy Forest, which was burned between 1984 and 2009. Vegetation data were collected in nested plots for the different forest layers in the burned and unburned forest. Using GLM, we assessed fire impact on forest structure, species richness and diversity of the different forest layers. The recovery of burned forest was investigated using correlation analysis. In addition, we used descriptive methods to analyse fire impact on species composition.Results: Fire mainly influenced the middle forest layers, trees >1.50-m high and diameters <15cm, and significantly reduced tree density, basal area, species richness and diversity. Fire had no significant impact on the measured parameters of the shrub and top layers. Despite the severe impact of fire on the middle forest layers, most of the measured parameters of these layers were able to recover from fire disturbance within a short time. Twelve years after fire disturbance, tree density, basal area, species richness and diversity in burned forest areas no longer differed from unburned forest areas.

We studied the effects of mechanical site preparation (MSP) on post-fire vegetation regeneration within reforested sites in Mediterranean Israel.Location: Upper Galilee region, Israel.Methods: Vegetation cover and composition, ruderal species colonization and pine regeneration were monitored in four reforested sites for 3yr following wildland fires that burned mature Pinus brutia and P.halepensis plantations. In each reforested site, a 50mx50m monitoring area was assigned and measurements were conducted within five subplots (2mx50m) encompassing three MSP patch types: ploughed patches (P), unploughed patches (UP) and planting mounds (M) that combined ploughing, pit digging and wood-chip mulching.Results: Recovery of vegetation cover (excluding pines) was rapid. The MSP patch type significantly affected vegetation cover in the first spring following the fire: cover was lowest on M, intermediate on P and highest on UP. However, these differences became minor by the third spring following the fire. Total woody species richness was not affected by MSP patch type, although there were minor effects on relative abundance of woody species. Two ruderal species were found, but their abundance became untraceable by the third year. Patterns of MSP effects on pine regeneration were similar for P.halepensis and P.brutia.

What is the potential contribution of the soil seed bank to the plant community composition on sites differing in their successional age or disturbance intensity?LocationExperimental Botanical Garden of Gottingen University, central Germany.MethodsAbove-ground vegetation and soil seed bank were studied on formerly arable fields in a 36-year-old permanent plot study with five disturbance intensities, ranging from yearly ploughing via mowing to long-term uninterrupted succession. We compared species compositions, seed densities and functional features of the seed bank and above-ground vegetation by using several methods in parallel.ResultsThe seed bank was mainly composed of early successional species typical of strongly disturbed habitats. The difference between seed bank composition and above-ground vegetation decreased with increasing disturbance intensity. The species of greatest quantitative importance in the seed bank was the non-native forb Solidago canadensis.ConclusionsThe ability of a plant community to regenerate from the soil seed bank dramatically decreases with increasing time since abandonment (successional age) and with decreasing disturbance intensity. The present study underlines that plant species typical of grasslands and woodlands are limited by dispersal capacity, owing to low capacity for accumulation of seeds in the soil and the fact that most species do not build up persistent seed banks.

On plots of a fixed size, does stem density alone predict number of species? Are differences in density related to disturbance and altitude?Location: Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve, central India.Methods: 42 sites, each with three replicate 10-m radius plots, were examined. All trees (>= 30 cm GBH) in each plot were measured for firth at breast height, alpha-diversity, species richness and evenness were calculated for each site. The sites were ordinated by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) using relative importance values of component species. Correspondence Analysis was used to broadly delineate communities. Anthropogenic disturbances, were recorded in terms of percentage of trees lopped, scale of lopping, number of domestic livestock dung piles and foot trails (both livestock and people) for each plot.Results: The NMS analysis exhibited a near linear arrangement of sites with no evidence of discrete vegetation zones. NMS axes were significantly related to altitude and disturbance scores. With increasing elevation, basal area increased but number of species. alpha-diversity and its components declined monotonically.

Two analyses are undertaken: (1) a composite DCA analysis of 1993 and 2002 survey data to assess plant community transitions within the wetland and over time, and (2) analysis of recent vegetation data to explore wider vegetation gradients. This allows (3) communities to be classified using NVC classes and (4) integrated with revised Ellenberg F-values.Results: Drought impact and subsequent hydrological recovery over a 22-year period are quantified. Vegetation data display strong moisture and successional gradients. Analysis shows a shift from grassland communities toward mire communities across much of the site.Conclusion: The site is regionally unique in that it has a detailed long-term monitoring record. Hydrological data and vegetation survey have allowed the impact of the most recent 'groundwater' drought (1989-1997) to be quantified.

Compositional and edaphic gradients were studied in montane forests of the Bavarian Alps (Germany), in which natural mixed deciduous-coniferous tree layers have been altered by past management in favour of Picea abies. Data on species composition and ecological factors were collected in a stratified random sample of 84 quadrats comprising a gradient from pure Picea to pure Fagus sylvatica stands. Data about the understorey composition were subjected to indirect (DCA) and direct gradient analysis (RDA) with the proportion of Picea in the canopy as a constraining variable. Three principal components of a matrix containing seven descriptors of mineral soil, relief and tree layer cover were included as covariables describing the variability of primary ecological factors. Gradients of organic topsoil morphology and chemistry were extracted correspondingly. Responses of individual species, species group and topsoil attributes were studied by simple and partial correlation analysis. Mosses were significantly more abundant and diverse under Picea stands. Few graminoid and herb species were partially associated with Picea, and total understorey richness and cover did not differ systematically by stand type. No relationship between tree layer and understorey diversity was detected at the studied scale. Juvenile Fagus sylvatica was the only woody species significantly less abundant under Picea. In the topsoil lower base saturation, lower pH and larger C/N-ratios in the litter layer were partially attributable to the proportion of Picea, only for base saturation a relationship was detected in greater soil depth also.

Floristic data collected from permanent plots during 14 consecutive years are used to model the frequency of the 62 most abundant species in relation to post-ploughing succession, topography and rainfall in annual Mediterranean grasslands located in a Quercus rotundifolia dehesa. The interannual dynamics of species richness are also analysed. From 1980 to 1993, presence/absence data of grassland species were noted in five 20 cm X 20 cm permanent quadrats placed at random in 1980 in 14 permanent plots on a south-facing slope along the topographic gradient. Weekly autumn rainfall data over the 14 years were analysed using a profile attributes index and Hybrid Multidimensional Scaling to arrange the years according to their autumn rainfall pattern. Generalized Linear Models were used to fit the species richness and species frequency according to topographic position, age since the last ploughing episode, total rainfall in the growing season and autumn rainfall pattern using a forward stepwise procedure. The richness model includes all of these variables, and reveals a relatively high goodness-of-fit (71 %). The fact that the meteorological factors play a key role in modelling richness forces us to include them if we wish to use richness as an indicator of the degree of disturbance in these highly fluctuating annual pastures. Models of species dynamics show that although roughly 33 % of the species have a successional behaviour, the majority are more dependent on temporal heterogeneity associated with rainfall or spatial heterogeneity linked to the topographic gradient."	53	0	0	0	45	1	62	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Plant species richness in calcareous grasslands as affected by dispersability in space and time	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	1	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.2307/1479087	Article	MAY 1998	1998	". Species richness in calcareous grassland is discussed against the background of historical dispersal processes associated with traditional land-use management such as grazing, but also the artificial establishment by hayseed. Important vectors in the traditionally man-made landscape were sheep and cattle or other livestock such as goats. Calcareous grasslands were not only connected to each other but also to other habitats such as villages, forests, arable fields and heathlands by these vectors which could cover large distances (e.g. transhumance shepherding), which is not the case in the current man-made landscape. Species richness after restoration management of abandoned and afforested calcareous grasslands was predicted by using characters of dispersability in space and time. These were the persistence of the species in the vegetation and the diaspore bank after abandonment or afforestation and the dispersal capacity through wind and sheep. The results reveal that reintroduction of sheep grazing is necessary to reestablish the original species richness. The first validation of the prediction of the succession on clear-cut sites and a comparison with data of species composition in abandoned quarries and the surroundings made it obvious that a species' own dispersal capacity in space is very low except for some well wind-dispersed species. Therefore, it is recommended to include and to simulate dispersal processes in future management to be able to restore the original species richness."	245	1	0	0	182	0	265	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

In floodplain wetlands, seed banks may display seasonal dynamics that are influenced by seasonal flooding and temperature; however, seasonal dynamics remain poorly understood. Location: Two dominant macrophyte communities in the Dongting Lake wetlands, China. Methods: We investigated seed-bank densities, vertical distributions, and species richness of two dominant macrophyte communities in the Dongting Lake wetlands during November 2017 (after flooding), January (winter), March (spring), and May 2018 (before flooding). Results: Carex and Miscanthus community seed-bank densities peaked in May (15,307 and 17,330 individuals/m(2), respectively), decreased from November to March, and were the lowest in January (440 and 627 individuals/m(2), respectively). Carex and Miscanthus community seed-bank densities declined rapidly with soil depth during May from 13,414 and 16,535 individuals/m(2) in the 0-5 cm soil layer to 254 and 42 individuals/m(2) in the 10-20 cm soil layer, respectively. The species richness of Carex and Miscanthus community seed banks peaked during May (7 and 8 species, respectively). However, species similarity with extant communities was low (0.23 and 0.27, respectively). Conclusions: The results of this study emphasize the significance of seasons and stratification in the utilization of soil seed banks for floodplain wetland restoration. Supplementary measures such as bud banks and introduced seedlings should be adopted for the successful restoration of macrophyte communities because of the low density and richness of perennial species in seed banks."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2025-05-14	WOS:001484441500001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Despite their importance, the use of reference conditions in restoration projects has been inconsistent, particularly where habitat degradation has occurred at landscape scales. Here we use baseline vegetation data and the relationship between vegetation communities and environmental conditions to identify and select positive reference sites within a proposed landscape-scale restoration project. In addition, we demonstrate the use of positive references in monitoring through an adjacent post-restoration case study area.LocationWild Nephin National Park, Mayo, Ireland.MethodsVegetation communities at sites (n = 230) within a large (4700 ha) proposed restoration area were surveyed using quadrats. Positive reference sites were identified following community classification within the Irish Vegetation Classification (IVC). The environmental determinants of positive references were assessed through redundancy analysis. Based on these determinants, sites with similar environmental conditions were identified though k-medoids clustering, enabling positive references to be spatially designated. Ordination and Ellenberg's indicator values were used to demonstrate the use of positive references in restoration monitoring.ResultsA total of 49 positive reference sites were identified for the study area. Altitude, soil type, subsoil type, soil depth and topographical position were identified as significant determinants of communities within positive reference sites. K-medoids clustering with 11 clusters accurately grouped environmentally similar regions of the study area and enabled positive reference sites to be determined and designated spatially based on the cluster groupings.ConclusionsOverall, the study demonstrates with a practical example how landscape-scale restoration can be informed and monitored through the identification of appropriate positive reference sites within the restoration area, based on the relationship between existing non-degraded plant communities and their environmental determinants, derived from baseline habitat data.Through analysing vegetation communities and their relationship with environmental factors, our study establishes the location and composition of positive reference sites across a 4700-ha proposed restoration area of conifer plantation in the west of Ireland. The study contributes to the advancement of best practice in planning and monitoring of landscape restoration projects, where multiple positive references may be required.image"	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2024-07-22	WOS:001269052000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Small rocky outcrops are geological features commonly found in these systems and constitute biodiversity reservoirs, protecting sensitive species from grazing and farming activities. We aimed to assess the relevance of including rocky outcrop conservation within wood-pastures to increase biodiversity. To achieve this goal, we studied the plant communities occurring within the outcrops and in the wood-pasture matrix to evaluate the impact of rocky outcrops on the overall plant taxonomic and functional diversities of these systems. Location Montemor-o-Novo (Alentejo, Portugal). Methods We sampled 102 plant communities occurring in outcrops and the adjacent wood-pasture matrix, and analysed alpha, beta, gamma and functional diversities. We identified the main intrinsic factors affecting outcrop plant composition and their functional groups using Linear and Generalized Linear Mixed models, and characterized the effect of outcrop size through Generalized Additive Models. Results We found plant richness to be similar in wood-pasture matrix and outcrops. However, beta-diversity analysis revealed a high species turnover between both communities. Functional indices indicated higher plant functional diversity in outcrops and trait analyses identified three functional groups dissimilarly distributed in both communities: (a) perturbation- and stress-sensitive plants, with outcrops constituting an important refuge for this group; and (b) grazing-tolerant and (c) weedy herbs dominating the wood-pastures. Finally, we also found increased plant richness in outcrops with a longer length for their minor axis, i.e. wider outcrops, and greater rock cover area. Conclusions Our results indicate that the presence of small rocky outcrops in evergreen oak wood-pastures greatly increases their gamma and functional diversities. Consequently, outcrop protection strongly impacts overall wood-pasture biodiversity and underlines the suitability of including outcrop conservation as a cost-effective solution capable of increasing biodiversity in these agroforestry systems."	11	0	0	0	10	0	11	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Many fewer studies have assessed the effects of cushion shrubs in drier and less cold mountain habitats and how these effects vary within the shrub canopy and with increasing drought stress with exposure and disturbance by fire. Location A mountain steppe of the Golestan National Park in the semi-arid climate of northeast Iran. Methods We quantified the cover of understorey species at the center and edge of the canopy of the thorny cushion shrub Onobrychis cornuta and in paired open areas, in north and south exposures and unburned and burned plots, two years after a fire. Soil chemical variables and moisture were measured in treatments. We quantified cushions' center and edge effects on understorey species cover with the Relative Interaction Index (RII). Treatment effects on RII cover were analyzed with generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) and species composition with Correspondence Analysis. Results In unburned plots, competition for cover was very high at cushion centers and strongly decreased at cushion edges. Exposure stress did not affect competition in unburned plots. Fire slightly decreased competition but only at center cushion shrub position and at south exposure. Species composition was mostly affected by exposure and fire treatments, although there was subtle variation in species composition among patches due to fire. Cushion position, fire and exposure treatments affected soil moisture and chemical variables, but soil changes did not explain cushion effects on understorey cover and their variations along treatments. Conclusions The effects of the cushion shrub were highly negative and in particular at cushion center, likely due to interference and competition for light in a dry and not too cold environment. Fire only slightly decreased competition in the short term, likely due to the delayed response of understorey species to disturbance induced by fire."	9	0	0	0	8	0	9	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000003	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

An innovative vegetation survey design in Mediterranean cliffs shows evidence of higher tolerance of specialized rock plants to rock climbing activity	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	21	2	NA	NA	289	297	NA	10.1111/avsc.12355	Article	APR 2018	2018	"Questions: Is rock climbing pressure, together with microtopographic conditions, disturbing cliff plant cover and composition? What are the climbing impacts on rock specialist and non-specialist species? Can a case-control approach, not previously implemented in cliff environments, offer additional value for actual and long-term ecological research?Location: Chulilla, Levante coast, Spain.Methods: We surveyed in situ nine rock climbing routes in order to examine differences in plant species richness and vegetation cover between unclimbed and climbed transects. To evaluate the effect of rock climbing on vegetation, we implemented a case-control methodology using the two zones immediately adjacent to common climbing routes as control points (i.e. unclimbed transects). Three quadrats of 3 m x 3 m were established at different cliff heights. All identified species were categorized as either specialized rock species or non-specialized rock species based on their habitat preferences from literature. Non-specialized rock species were further differentiated as either moderately associated with rocky environments or strict generalists. The rock climbing impact on each group of species was analysed using LMM.Results: Our results provide evidence of the effects of rock climbing on a Mediterranean cliff, which has received little attention so far. Significantly fewer generalist species were present on climbed compared to unclimbed transects, while specialized and moderately specialized rock species were not significantly affected by rock climbing intensity. Furthermore, while rock-specific and moderately specialized species could cope with microsite heterogeneity, areas with fewer cracks had significantly negative effects on generalist species.Conclusions: Moderate rock climbing activity on cliff environments might not reduce the presence of specialized rock-dwelling species; however, this activity inherently impacts the biodiversity of cliff ecosystems due to its large effect on generalist species. We recommend that future conservation studies account for the degree of species dependence on rocky habitats to better understand rock-climbing impacts in these singular ecosystems. According to our experience, the implementation of an adjacent case-control survey design for monitoring cliff vegetation can help improve and unify methodology for such studies, as this is still an underdeveloped field."	19	1	0	0	14	0	20	2018-12-28	WOS:000430912500013	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do different vegetation types have different trajectories of change?LocationA long-term ecological research site comprising temperate eucalypt grassy woodland and forest in south-eastern Australia, converted from pastoral use to conservation management. This has involved the implementation of habitat restoration treatments in addition to the cessation of livestock grazing and fertilizer inputs.MethodsWe surveyed ground-layer floristic composition over a 4-yr interval, in 96 1-ha sites that had been subjected to combinations of restoration treatments aimed at improving the condition of the woodland habitat for fauna: (1) Reduced kangaroo grazing intensity; (2) Addition of coarse woody debris; and (3) Burning. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to plot the sites, and to analyse the average trajectories of floristic change for each of six initially identified vegetation types, and the restoration treatments. We partitioned Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures to rank individual species' contributions to floristic change in each vegetation type between 2007 and 2011.ResultsThe identities of the six vegetation types identified at time zero was strongly retained over the 4-yr observation period. There was generally a uniform change across the vegetation types, which was the result of increases in biomass of the characteristic dominant perennial grasses, and increases in some native forbs. The two vegetation types with evidence of past fertilization showed some convergence with native vegetation types due to the decrease in some exotic species. The restoration treatments had no significant influence on species composition.ConclusionsThe native herbaceous vegetation in the woodland was largely resistant to compositional change, although seasonal conditions increased the biomass of the perennial grasses defining the different vegetation types. However, sites with an evident history of past fertilization and notable amounts of exotic pasture species changed slightly but significantly, with some pasture species declining and floristic convergence with native vegetation over 4yr. These rates of change need to be considered in the application of vegetation offsetting policy."	11	0	0	0	11	0	11	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700006	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How does recurrent mowing influence resource-use successional trajectory and flowering phenology in communities? Does intraspecific variation contribute to these community-level functional responses?LocationRoad slopes in Mediterranean southern France.MethodsWe designed a chronosequence of 25 road slopes, each including both unmown and yearly mown parts. We analysed the influence of age and mowing on community-level trait values (CWM) of LDMC, SLA, onset of flowering Date (OFD), end of flowering date (EFD) and flowering duration (FDur). We tested for contribution of intraspecific variation of traits to these functional variations. We also tested for relationship between changes in taxonomic composition, environmental parameters and functional responses.ResultsWe found slower successional variation of resource-use strategies in communities undergoing recurrent mowing, compared to unmown vegetation. Onset of flowering was earlier in mown communities. End of flowering and flowering duration did not directly depend on successional stage or mowing but related to resource-use strategies. Species turnover was an important driver of functional variation and the major components of plant taxonomic variation were primarily related to environmental and functional changes.ConclusionsOn road slopes, successional changes in functional and taxonomic composition were influenced by mowing, which did not totally prevent vegetation changes. Disturbance by mowing impacted resource-use strategy and indirectly influenced flowering phenology by limiting plant investment into resource conservation in aerial parts. Community-level relationship between resource-use strategy and flowering phenology suggests a consistent trade-off between vegetative growth and flowering phenology among plant species within communities.

Out of four vegetation types, poor fens and especially flooded fens were over-represented in the present-day subset, while rich fens and quaking fens were under-represented. Overall species composition differed between historical plots and their presentday counterparts, even within individual vegetation types. Historical rich fens showed significantly higher b-diversity than their present-day counterparts, which predominantly represent flooded fens. Inferred water level and its fluctuation, Ellenberg moisture and nutrient values have increased, while inferred pH, conductivity and Ellenberg light value have decreased.Conclusions: The historically wide array of fen vegetation has turned into a homogeneous and floristically depauperate set of acidic yet productive flooded fens with a high water level. Rich and quaking fens that were both low in nutrient availability and had a stable water level near the moss layer experienced a large and substantial reduction and have become rare in the landscape. Eutrophication combined with a lack of management has resulted in fen species persisting only in flooded fens. However, fluctuating water levels and high nutrient availability in flooded fens favour productive Sphagnum fens over the other vegetation types, and, importantly, do not support some endangered fen species."	31	0	0	0	28	0	33	2017-04-01	WOS:000398083700008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We calculated species diversity using the antilog of the Shannon-Wiener index, and considered its two components, richness and evenness. We also assessed the proportion of prostrate and erect species. Species abundance was based on biomass estimations.Results: Species diversity under high stocking rates gradually decreased throughout the experiment and became nearly 50% lower than under low stocking rate. This decline was largely accounted for by changes of evenness because species richness was not affected by stocking rates. Species composition clearly diverged among the three treatments over time. Low stocking rate-maintained a fairly constant relative cover of erect and prostrate grasses throughout the experiment, whereas intermediate and high stocking rate treatments were gradually and consistently enriched in prostrate grasses and forbs. These effects occurred simultaneously with drastic inter-annual changes likely driven by annual precipitation.Conclusions: The range of stocking rates had no effect on species richness, but reduced diversity through the effect on evenness. High stocking rate progressively increased the proportion of prostrate species in the biomass."	20	3	0	0	13	0	23	2016-10-26	WOS:000384751300009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The presence and relative abundance of 8394 BTs were compared with 11192 unique taxon mentions within SLs. Comparisons were made for individual taxa and whole communities, and at the scales of individual line segments and whole town lines. The influence of equal weighting and rank weighting of the SLs on the comparisons was assessed.ResultsThe SLs on a line segment typically recorded more taxa than did the BTs. The species present in BTs and SLs on individual line segments were indicated by Cohen's Kappa to have substantial agreement.' Correlations between BTs and SLs of all taxa on the same town line increased with the number of BTs and SLs on the town line, and when the relative abundances of SL taxa were modelled using rank weighting rather than equal weighting. Correlations between BTs and SLs for individual taxa were higher for taxa that had more BTs. Correlations between BTs and SLs were also higher when the relative abundances of SL taxa were modelled using rank weighting vs equal weighting.ConclusionsSLs capture greater detail of presettlement forest composition than do BTs. The relative abundance of a taxon mentioned in a presettlement land survey SL can be meaningfully predicted using its rank in an SL and application of a rank weighting model."	7	0	0	0	6	0	9	2015-07-02	WOS:000356007400013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We asked whether the acacia trees were able to regenerate in the absence of domesJic livestock, either beneath acacia canopies or in artificial clearings.Location: Tropical coastal Tanzania (former Mkwaja Ranch, now in Saadani National Park).Methods: We set out a total of 48 plots on four sites in November 2001, and assigned them to three treatments: trees felled (FN), trees felled and the stumps poisoned (FP) with Triclopyr, and no intervention (controls, NN). We analysed soils of plots for texture and nutrients. In two wet (July 2002 and 2003) and one dry (February 2003) seasons we assessed grass and tree leaf biomass and transpiration rates, and counted acacia seedlings and resprouts. The effects of treatments (controlled for site and other co-variables) on grass growth and acacia rectaiitment were determined statistically using general linear models (GLM).Results: Acacia leaves had a much higher stomatal conductance than grasses, with the consequence that total evapotranspiration in woodland was higher than in clearings. In the wet seasons, grass biomass and seedling densities were significantly higher in clearings than in control plots, which we attributed to more.favourable moisture conditions, In the dry season, by contrast, we found no differences, and all seedlings had died. On FN plots, 71% of stumps, and on FP plots, 11% resprouted (coppicing), but only a quarter of these shoots survived until July 2003. Root suckering occurred spontaneously at low densities. No root suckers or resprouts grew beyond the grass layer.Conclusions: Acacia woodlands do not regenerate in the absence of cattle grazing, and tree cutting in combination with appropriate fire management could potentially accelerate re-establishment of open grassland. However, regeneration might occur in the future due to the increasing wildlife populations within the new national park."	3	0	0	0	2	0	4	2015-04-29	WOS:000352131500014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What were the structural characteristics of canopy and surface fuels and potential fire behaviour in reference forests, and how do they compare to contemporary forests? How might information from reference conditions be used to inform current restoration and management practices?LocationLake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada, California and Nevada, USA.MethodsTree species composition, size structure, basal area, density, surface and canopy fuels, and potential fire behaviour were quantified for reference and contemporary conditions in 32 stands. This was accomplished by integrating field measurements and dendroecological techniques with vegetation and fire behaviour simulation models.ResultsContemporary Jeffrey pine and mixed conifer forests had more trees, more basal area, smaller trees and a different size structure than the reference forest. Contemporary red fir and lodgepole pine forests also had more and smaller trees, but basal areas were similar to the reference. Red fir forests also shifted in composition towards lodgepole pine. Vegetation and fire models indicate that contemporary Jeffrey pine and mixed conifer forests have higher flame length, rates of spread, lower crowning and torching indices, and more passive crown fire than the reference forests. In contrast, contemporary red fir and lodgepole pine forests only had lower crowning and torching indices, and flame length and rate of spread were only higher with extreme weather and high surface fuel load.ConclusionsContemporary Jeffrey pine and mixed conifer forests deviate the most from the reference, and restoration objectives for these forests should emphasize density and basal area reduction of smaller diameter stems. Restoration objectives for red fir should shift species composition and reduce basal area by thinning smaller diameter lodgepole pine. For lodgepole pine forests, restoration objectives should include reduction of density and basal area of smaller diameter stems. Fire or other surface fuel treatments will be needed in all the forests to maintain lower fuel loads, albeit at different time intervals."	47	0	0	0	43	0	57	2014-01-01	WOS:000328544400004	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Donana Natural Park, SW Spain. Methods The effect of goat grazing was evaluated, over a period of 42 mo, in 100 ha of pine forest understorey with an average density of 217 trees.ha-1. Grazing by large herbivores was halted temporarily in the study area, with wild deer excluded from 1970, and domestic goats excluded from 2002. However, following the creation of grazing exclusion plots and sampling of the vegetation within as a control, adult female Payoya goats were introduced to the area in spring 2007. Vegetation was sampled twice yearly using the point-intercept method, and data of frequency, cover and phytovolume obtained. The study was completed with an analysis of change in the flammability of the study area (determined using data on the phytovolume and flammability of species). Changes in species richness and species diversity were determined. Results After 42 mo, the phytovolume of the ungrazed vegetation had increased significantly by 32%, while bare soil had decreased by 5%. This gave rise to a significant increase in flammability of 25%. Within the grazed area, species phytovolume decreased significantly by 34%, leading to a significant increase in bare soil of 51%, while the flammability of the area decreased by 22%. The number of species remained constant throughout the study at 20 species. Significant differences in species diversity were observed between grazed and ungrazed areas after 42 mo of grazing (species diversity index after 42 mo of exclusion = 1.59 +/- 0.17, species diversity index after 42 mo of grazing = 0.95 +/- 0.13). Conclusions Monitoring of the scrub understorey has shown the positive impact of grazing goats: the resulting decrease in the quantity of total phytovolume (easily combustible vegetation) induces changes in species diversity without lowering species richness and reduces the risk of fire."	54	1	0	0	35	2	59	2013-01-01	WOS:000312159400008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Plots were assigned to the first or second hierarchy of EUNIS (European Nature Information System) habitat classification. For each plot, the number of native plants (including archaeophytes, i.e. alien plants introduced before 1500 AD) and neophytes (alien plants introduced after 1500 AD) was recorded. Neophytes were classified according their Raunkiaer's life form. For each UTM we selected eight predictors related to land cover composition, anthropogenic context and climate. The association of neophyte and native species richness with these predictor variables was explored by generalized linear mixed models for each terrestrial habitat type after controlling for plot area.Results: A total of 77 different neophyte species were found distributed among the eight habitat types with fitted models. Minimum adequate models on both neophyte and native species richness were highly variable. In general, native species richness responded more to climatic variables, while neophyte species richness was associated more with human landscape factors such as distance to main roads and, secondarily, cropland cover.Conclusions: Context factors defined on a large scale (10 km) have a significant effect on local native and neophyte species richness for many habitat types in Catalonia. Our results highlight the major influence of climatic context on native species richness and the influence of human landscape context on neophyte species richness in the study region. The inconsistency of results between habitat types suggests that this large-scale effect might be highly idiosyncratic and dependent on species ecology and life form."	25	1	0	0	24	1	27	2012-02-16	WOS:000299207600002	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Overgrazing can degrade riparian vegetation. Will sensitivity and vulnerability to grazing increase in upper mountain zones because of the harsh physical environment?Location: We compared the impact of cattle grazing along natural elevational corridors provided by two first-order creeks in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada.Methods: Substrate and vegetation characteristics were assessed in quadrats within transects positioned in ungrazed or lightly grazed, versus moderately to heavily grazed sites extending from the alpine down through the subalpine, montane, parkland and prairie zones.Results: Analyses revealed that 18 of 19 substrate and vegetation characteristics varied along the elevational profile (17 P < 0.05; 1 P < 0.1). Fifteen differed with grazing (12 P < 0.05; 3 P < 0.1), which was associated with coarser substrate with lower pH, reduced diversity and density of shrubs and trees, reduced vegetation cover, increased percent cover and species of weeds and changes in proportions of particular plants such as increasing yarrow (Achillea millefolium) and decreasing mountain valerian (Valeriana sitchensis). Significant grazing x elevation interactions for seven characteristics (5 P < 0.05; 2 P < 0.1) indicated greater impacts at higher elevations.Conclusions: This study revealed that the upper elevations were heavily affected, despite their shorter, seasonally restricted grazing history.

For each urbanisation level. nitrates and ammonium stocks were quantified; the herbaceous vegetation was surveyed as well as the soil seed bank (using the seedling emergence method).Results: Nitrate concentration increased with Urbanisation (the nitrate level in urban plots was twice the concentration in periurban ones) whereas the ammonium level was higher in periurban areas than in urban areas. In urban plots, the vegetation and the seed bank were more nitrophilous, whereas the nitrogen requirement was lower for periurban species. The relationship between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation was not significant.Conclusions: The higher nitrate concentration in the urban area appeared to be related to higher concentrations of atmospheric pollutants found in this area and lower ammonium levels may be related to the higher temperature in urban areas (leading to higher nitrification rates).

Understorey variables (species richness, cover and biomass) in beaver meadows were measured at eight plots, as well as sapling and seedlings age and height. In control treatments, ten plots on each forest type characterized forest structure.Results: Beavers alter vegetation dynamics, modifying biomass and composition of the original forest communities. Richness, cover and biomass were significantly modified when compared to the original understorey. Ferns are the most affected group, while grasses became more abundant. Many species established in the impacted sectors, which did not grow in primary forests. Trees did not regenerate in impacted areas for long periods, and many understorey original species are missing. Nothofagus forests are not adapted to support a long-term beaver impact.Conclusions: Beavers modify the original ecosystem from closed forest to a grass- and sedge-dominated meadow, due to the lack of adaptive regeneration strategies in the Nothofagus forests.

Seedling recruitment was monitored for three years.Results: Five of the six species established successfully at both sites largely irrespective of treatments, indicating seed limitation. Only in the small-seeded Arabis nemorensis, which was revealed to be strictly gap-dependent at the meadow site, could an obvious microsite limitation be shown. The non-significance of gap treatments in all other species at the relatively high productive meadow site is probably due to biomass removal by mowing in early summer. Only at the extremes of the seed size spectrum did the results meet predictions of plant ecological theory, such as the strict gap dependence of small-seeded species in closed swards or the positive to neutral response of large-seeded species to litter layers.Conclusions: Species identity was revealed to be the major factor influencing differences in recruitment.

To overcome dispersal limitation we transferred freshly mown plant material from species-rich sources to a restoration site on a former arable field. Before plant material application, topsoil was removed to accelerate nutrient impoverishment and create favourable conditions for seedling recruitment.Topsoil removal led to a drastic reduction in organic matter and essential mineral nutrients to the level of target communities (P) or even below (N, K). At a removal depth of 30 cm content of the soil seed bank that comprised exclusively of annual arable weeds, ruderals and some common grassland species, declined by 60 - 80%, while at a removal depth of 50 cm the seed bank was almost completely eliminated. With few exceptions, all species recorded in source plant material were found established at the restoration site. However, the overall correlation between seed content in plant material and establishment success was not very high.Vegetation development at the restoration site was characterized by a rapid decline in arable weeds and ruderals, while resident grassland species and species transferred with plant material increased rapidly from the third year onwards. After four years as many as 102 species were established that could be exclusively attributed to plant material transfer, among them many rare and highly endangered plants. Establishment of species from plant material was most successful in regularly flooded plots, due to the suppression of competitors as well as the creation of favourable moisture conditions for seedling emergence.Diaspore transfer with plant material proved to be an extremely successful method in restoring species-rich grassland. However, high quality of plant material and suitable site conditions with low competition in early stages of succession seem to be essential prerequisites."	183	3	0	0	178	1	215	2003-12-01	WOS:000220133300005	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The concept of species pool is reviewed. It is suggested to maintain the terms regional pool and local pool but replace actual pool by community pool. The regional and local pool are considered as selections from the regional and local flora based on ecological similarity. It is also suggested to include in the community pool a selection of species present only as diaspores in the diaspore bank (including diaspores from the seed rain), the selection being based on the same ecological criteria. Four approaches to determine the species pool are discussed: ecological, functional and phytosociological similarity, and an experimental approach. The phytosociological approach appears to be promising. The species pool is elaborated as a fuzzy set in the sense that each species of a community or a local or regional flora is a member of any community, local or regional species pool with different degrees of membership. This membership is defined as a probability of a species to become part of the community pool of a target community which is a function of the ecological (environmen-tal/functional/phytosociological) similarity of the species with the target community; the shortness of the distance of its nearest populations, the frequency/abundance, the dispersal capacity, the actual presence of dispersal mechanisms, the germinability of newly arrived diaspores, and the longevity of seeds (viability) in the diaspore bank. The information on species pools is needed for designing experiments where the number of species in a community is to be manipulated, for instance in restoration management."	252	8	2	0	178	1	279	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800008	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, most grassland restoration approaches involving seed addition transfer all target species at the same time. Our objective was to tackle the question: does the order of arrival influence the establishment of restored communities?Location: La-Batie-Neuve, Southern Alps, France.Methods: We applied sequential sowing using two groups, one set of dominant species and one set of subordinate species, each comprising three different perennial plant species. We tested four sowing treatments: control (without any sowing), two sequential sowing treatments (dominants first or subordinates first) and synchronous sowing. We analysed plant cover each year for three years after sowing and calculated priority and earliness indices (the third year) for each group and each sown species.Results: Manipulating the order of arrival shaped community composition and trajectories. Some species of both groups were positively affected by being sown first compared to being sown synchronously. However, dominant and subordinate groups differed in their earliness index, showing a significant benefit for subordinates to be sown first. The subordinate species Onobrychis viciifolia and Plantago lanceolata established only when they were sown first, while Festuca cinerea showed greater establishment when sown first and simultaneously, compared to late sowing. The dominant Anthyllis vulneraria was not affected by date or type of sowing. However, the cover of the most dominant Bromopsis erecta was lower when being sown second, allowing a control of its dominance by delayed sowing.Conclusion: The strength of priority effects differs between species, which may depend on niche characteristics or microenvironment, influencing (negatively or positively) the establishment of late-arriving species and affecting their competitive abilities. Our study provides evidence that plant community assembly was influenced by the order of arrival, but demonstrated a strong species-specific response to priority effects."	5	0	0	0	3	0	6	2023-11-21	WOS:001094089400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) was considered a focal animal for investigating the effect of foraging-tunnel disturbances created by herbivorous mammals on the above-ground biomass and species richness of graminoids and forbs. Here, we ask how foraging-tunnel disturbances created by plateau zokors influences above-ground plant biomass and species richness of graminoids and forbs in alpine grasslands.Location: The study was conducted at three sites of alpine grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China.Methods: In this study, all vascular plants were divided into graminoids and forbs, and 30 paired quadrats were randomly selected from each site. In total, 90 tunnel quadrats and 90 non-tunnel quadrats were surveyed and sampled.Results: This study showed that foraging-tunnel disturbances decreased the plant species richness of the grassland community and forbs by 16.5% and 17.7% respectively, whereas the response of graminoid species richness to foraging-tunnel disturbance was different among the three sites, in which foraging-tunnel disturbance decreased the graminoid species richness at Maqu and Xiahe sites and had no impact on the graminoid species richness at Tianzhu site. Regarding forbs, some legumes identified in the non-tunnel quadrats were not observed in the tunnel quadrats. The foraging-tunnel disturbances resulted in an above-ground plant biomass decrease of 21.9% in the grassland community, 27.3% in forbs, and 17.2% in graminoids respectively. The percentage of graminoids in the above-ground plant biomass increased from 50.4% in non-tunnel quadrats to 55.5% in tunnel quadrats, a relative increase of 10.1% from the initial percentage.Conclusions: These results indicate that the foraging-tunnel disturbances seemed to improve the forage availability for livestock in tunnel quadrats due to a higher relative proportion of graminoids in the grassland plant community, despite a decrease in graminoid biomass. However, the tunnels not only decreased the above-ground plant biomass and species richness of forbs, but also might have a negative impact on soil nitrogen input because of the absence of some legumes. The findings of this study suggest that reseeding some legumes is an effective approach to maintaining plant diversity and soil fertility, which can compensate for the negative effect of foraging-tunnel disturbance on alpine grasslands."	4	1	0	0	4	0	6	2023-11-27	WOS:001024996400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Grazing and mowing are important conservation management tools for such semi-natural habitats. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the influence of grazing and mowing on the diversity and species composition of wet grassland vegetation.Location Montane wet grasslands in the Gantrisch Nature Park, Switzerland.Methods We sampled 18 pairs of vegetation plots along land-use borders between grazing and mowing (fence-line contrasts), distributed over six fens, mostly belonging to the phytosociological alliance Calthion palustris. We tested for differences in structural parameters, biodiversity indices, mean ecological indicator values and the frequency of individual species. In addition, a detrended correspondence analysis was carried out.Results Management type had no influence on species richness, Shannon index or Shannon evenness. Maximum microrelief, vegetation height, mean nutrient indicator value and mean competitive strategy were significantly higher with grazing, whereas the mean aeration indicator value and the mean ruderal strategy were significantly higher with mowing. Cirsium oleraceum, Filipendula ulmaria, Geum rivale and Juncus effusus, species of nutrient-rich wet meadows, were more frequent under grazing, whereas mowing favoured grassland species with wide ecological amplitude, such as Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium pratense.Conclusions At the plot scale, vascular plant diversity did not differ between these management regimes. Thus, from the conservation point of view, in the study region, there is no clear preference for either management type, and both should be eligible for subsidies. At the landscape scale, it is beneficial to have both management types present to ensure high gamma-diversity, as they favour different species."	6	0	0	0	2	0	6	2023-08-21	WOS:000923322800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Alterations in species composition and the colonization of Cerrado grasslands by woody species can lead to long-term changes in these communities. In this study, we investigated changes over 20 years in three grassland areas, in terms of species richness and diversity and growth-form cover, as well as the effects of shrub and grass encroachment on species richness. Location Cerrado Brazilian savanna, moist grassland and dry shrub grassland. Areas under low and high anthropogenic pressure. Methods Plant species composition and cover were sampled on seven occasions between the years 2000 and 2020, in permanent line-transects. We compared plant cover, richness, diversity and growth-form cover between the periods for each area. Next, we developed mixed-effect linear models to test whether species richness in grasslands at the latest sampling event was altered by species representing 70% of the species cover at this time. Results Grasslands located in areas under higher anthropogenic pressure presented reduced richness and diversity, and cover concentrated on a few species of shrubs and large tussock grasses. Moist grassland undergoing encroachment by the native shrub Trembleya parviflora had lost over 50% of its diversity since encroachment. In the same area, a shrub grassland undergoing encroachment by native shrub Raulinoreitzia tremula, three native grass species and one exotic grass presented significantly reduced species richness. The moist grassland in an area under low anthropogenic pressure showed a reordering of the species cover over time, but a decrease in species richness. Conclusion We observed changes in plant richness, diversity, cover, composition and growth-form cover over a period of 20 years in grassland communities. We found, however, different trajectories in the three grassland areas sampled, mainly due to the encroachment of a few species, leading to floristic homogenization in grasslands located in areas under high anthropogenic pressure."	18	0	0	0	10	0	19	2022-07-21	WOS:000825382800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Different mechanisms summarized in three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain its varying effects depending on productivity. The insufficient compensation hypothesis (ICH) states that livestock causes the extinction of species that cannot compensate for biomass removal in unproductive sites, reducing species richness. The competitive release hypothesis (CRH) states that livestock increases plant diversity by attenuating competition, especially in productive environments. In the convergent evolution hypothesis (CEH), livestock has minor effects on diversity in unproductive sites because plants that endure stress are pre-adapted to grazing. These hypotheses have rarely been compared formally, and have mostly been tested on large spatial scales. Here we simultaneously test these hypotheses on a local scale. Location Natural semi-arid grassland, Oaxaca, Mexico. Methods We performed a long-term exclosure experiment, recording plant diversity annually over 17 years. In 2017 we measured species richness over a grazing intensity gradient. We used linear mixed-effects models, nestedness and beta-diversity analyses to evaluate diversity and composition in relation to grazing and productivity. Results Plant diversity generally increased with grazing intensity. In line with CRH, species richness increased as grazing became more intensive due to a progressive incorporation of increasingly poor competitors to the community, with a seemingly stronger effect under high productivity. This suggests that herbivores limit competitive species and prevent competitive exclusion. ICH may play a secondary role because the effect was reversed in low productivity inside exclosures. Conclusions Our finding implies that in productive sites, the exclusion of livestock can be detrimental to plant diversity as a lack of grazing accelerates competitive exclusion. By contrast, in limiting environments, grazing can preserve diversity if livestock are kept at low stocking densities. Our results show that small-scale variations in productivity need to be considered when designing livestock management."	6	0	0	0	5	1	6	2022-04-13	WOS:000777971100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Other studies have demonstrated that passive restoration of subtropical grassland is possible in environments where there is substantial native remnant vegetation in the surrounding landscape. This study examined a chronosequence of abandoned fields to investigate the recovery of fragmented grassland in a matrix of cultivated land with significant exotic species that may impede succession.LocationDarling Downs, Queensland, Australia.MethodsIn this study we surveyed a chronosequence of ex-cultivated subtropical grasslands in Queensland's Darling Downs, where only 1% of the original grasslands remain. Floristic surveys were carried out in 80 fallow sites up to 51 years old, and data were compared with 16 previously surveyed remnant grasslands on the same land type.ResultsRichness of native species increased with time since cultivation and approached, but did not reach, that of remnant grasslands after 51 years, whereas the richness of exotics declined with time since cultivation. Rainfall and grazing positively and negatively affected exotic plant abundance respectively and these factors had no significant direct or indirect effect on the native species richness. In terms of composition, fallow grasslands supported 54% of the native plant species from remnant grasslands after 51 years. The native perennial grasses Dichanthium sericeum and Aristida leptopoda were the only dominant species in the remnants that were present in more than 60% of the fallow grasslands. Of the species from remnants that were missing from fallow sites, most were native perennial forbs and grasses. Compositional dissimilarity of fallow grassland to remnant grasslands remained high after 51 years (78%). Grassland species that are uncommon in nearby hill woodlands were preferentially absent in fallow grassland and this partly explains the slow compositional recovery.ConclusionIn a highly fragmented landscape, passive restoration is only partially effective. The restoration of grassland is probably enhanced by repositories of native seeds from hill woodlands that are too rocky to cultivate. However, some species may have to be actively reintroduced to achieve complete recovery. In this landscape, where grazing is a dominant land use, exotic species do not seem to impede succession."	3	0	0	0	3	0	3	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800019	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, changes in land use like grazing intensification and the cessation of traditional management have dramatic effects on the extent and biodiversity of these ecosystems. In this study we investigated how current management practices and land use history shape species composition and diversity patterns in semi-natural grasslands of the Eastern hills of the Cluj region. Location Eastern hills of Cluj (Dealurile Clujului de Est - ROSCI0295) Natura 2000 conservation site and close surroundings, Transylvania, Romania. Methods We surveyed plots in extensively and intensively grazed grasslands, grasslands mown by hand or heavy machinery, and abandoned grasslands. To quantify grassland continuity, we analysed a series of historical cadastral and more current maps ranging from the 18th to the 21st century. Results Species composition was significantly influenced by current management, grassland continuity and environmental factors. Mown and extensively grazed grasslands had more grassland and forest edge specialists than abandoned and intensively grazed grasslands. In addition, there was a positive relationship between the number of grassland specialists, forest edge species and grassland continuity, while the number of ruderal species related negatively to grassland continuity. The highest diversity values were recorded in traditionally mown grasslands. However, diversity-related variables were poorly reflected by grassland continuity. Conclusions This study provides evidence that short-term abandonment may not be as detrimental for grasslands as often suggested, and intensive grazing results in the greatest loss in species diversity. Grassland continuity tightly influences the persistence of grassland specialist species. Thus, we recommend land use history to be included in the selection and identification of high-nature-value grasslands by prioritizing conservation efforts for older grasslands."	28	0	0	0	19	0	28	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, the sustainable use of wetlands for grazing will depend on the management implemented and the resilience of each type of them. In this context, we addressed the question: will the vegetation in the studied wetland be able to recover its structural and functional parameters in the short term after livestock exclusion? Location Temperate fluvial wetlands in the middle Delta of the Parana River, Argentina, South America. Methods We evaluated the effect of cattle ranching on vegetation composition and diversity by determining changes in species richness and evenness, biomass (green and dry vegetative, and reproductive biomass), and litter content. We also analyzed the changes in biomass of weeds and of species according to their forage quality, toxicity, and growth form. We applied a randomized block design (by topographic position) with repeated measures over time, using livestock exclusion as treatment. Results After 16 months, livestock exclusion affected vegetation species richness, but did not have a significant effect on diversity due to a slightly compensatory effect of evenness. Species composition differed markedly among treatments over time. There was an increase in dry and green vegetative biomass and litter content after eight months of exclusion, while changes in reproductive biomass occurred later. The increase in these variables was closely related to changes in biomass of species with erect habit and good forage quality. Conclusions Livestock exclusion increased the forage value for the studied wetland by the development of natural palatable species typical of these environments. This shift in species composition promoted a higher production in biomass in the ungrazed areas. This suggests a remarkable recovery of the structural and functional parameters of the vegetation communities in the short term (two years)."	17	0	0	0	14	0	17	2019-09-30	WOS:000486544300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Is it possible to measure significant changes in SAV distribution in deep lakes characterized by different trophic states and stable water physico-chemical conditions using standard procedures over a 3-yr period (2010-2013), as defined by the Water Framework Directive?LocationWe collected data from four deep lakes belonging to the Italian volcanic lake system (central Italy), which is one of the most important reserves of freshwater in Mediterranean Italy as well as one of the main hotspots of stonewort diversity in the Mediterranean area.MethodsMacrophytes were sampled along five transects in each lake in 2010 and 2013. Data on aquatic plant diversity, composition and abundance were collected from each 1-m depth intervals down to the maximum colonization depth. Simultaneously, the water quality and climate were assessed by standard procedures. Data were analysed with PCA, ANOVA, PROTEST and rank abundance curves.ResultsThe sampling revealed a significant rearrangement of SAV. Increased species diversity in the first meters of depth (0-5m) was due to the migration of mid-depth species to lower depths. A reduction in the maximum growing depth of macrophytes was observed within the deepest stonewort communities (below 5m). No significant changes emerged in water quality or climate.ConclusionsOver 3yr, SAV displayed significant changes that appear to be independent of summer nutrient conditions and climate drivers. In particular, vascular and stonewort species underwent a distinct spatial rearrangement according to specific behaviours. The present data point to the need for more rigorous analyses of the intra-annual dynamics of macrophytes in deep lakes. An influence of the significant increase in spring precipitation (which is in keeping with local climate variability) recorded in central Italy in the last decade cannot be ruled out a priori, nor can the possibility of stochastic fluctuations be excluded. All these considerations further highlight the critical role of aquatic plants as bioindicators."	21	0	0	0	16	0	21	2016-10-01	WOS:000386136600017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Irreversible changes have nonetheless also been described for arid regions. What are the contributions of internal/equilibrium vs external/non-equilibrium factors to vegetation dynamics and can degradation due to overstocking be reversed after removal of livestock?Location: Goegap Nature Reserve, Namaqualand, South Africa.Methods: The descending point method was conducted annually from 1974 at two transects. Vegetation change was assessed in terms of vegetation cover, species composition, life-form composition, range condition, species richness and diversity. Principal coordinates analysis was used to illustrate the trajectories in floristic data, and the effects of stocking density and rainfall were examined with redundancy analysis.Results: Vegetation cover, species richness and Shannon-Wiener index of diversity showed an increase. Ties positive changes could be related to the removal of high numbers of livestock and low wildlife numbers in the first years of survey. A gradual decline in the rate of increase in some of these parameters could be related to high grazing pressure during the later monitored years. There was a notable increase in non-succulent chamaephytes, but the initial increase in succulent chamaephytes was not sustained. The directional change evident in perennial species composition, supports the equilibrium concept, whereby the negative changes induced by heavy grazing were partially reversed. Within the directional change, four quasi-stable states could be distinguished, which could be reconciled with the state-and-transition model. The annual component showed no directional change, but displayed event-driven, non-equilibrim dynamics by fluctuating in reaction to the timing and quantity of rainfall.Conclusions: The vegetation change displayed elements of both equlibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics, and demonstrated that the effects of heavy grazing in the Succulent Karoo were reversible. Overall, the recovery process proceeded slowly and was primarily detected in the perennial component of the vegetation. The increase in wildlife numbers in the later studied years and decline in perennial vegetation cover stress the need for active management of animal numbers to avoid vegetation degradation."	23	0	0	0	20	3	25	2015-04-01	WOS:000352131500015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Does increasing topsoil removal depth increase the success of plant material transfer establishment?LocationThe Camargue, Rhone delta, France.MethodsA small-scale restoration experiment involving Mediterranean meso-xeric grasslands was conducted in a former rice field area. During 3yr, plant species richness and composition were compared on permanent plots subject to the following four treatments: 5cm topsoil removal, 20cm topsoil removal, 5cm topsoil removal with plant material transfer, and 20cm topsoil removal with plant material transfer. Additionally, the seed bank at 0- to 5-cm deep, at 5- to 20-cm deep and at 20- to 40-cm deep were studied in order to evaluate the effect of topsoil removal.ResultsAfter 4mo, species richness, number of target species and similarity to the reference Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland significantly increased with plant material transfer relative to the no transfer treatment (topsoil removal without transfer). However, we found no significant difference in plant species number between the two depths of topsoil removal. This can be explained by the absence of any variation in soil seed bank between 5cm and 20cm. The species richness and number of target species decreased significantly in transfer treatment between the first and the second monitoring. Despite this general decrease in the first year, the plant material transfer treatment showed significantly more target species than the no transfer treatment and a higher similarity to the Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland.ConclusionIn order to restore a Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland plant community, plant material transfer combined with topsoil removal appears to be a relevant method. Removing 5cm of topsoil eliminates half of the density of the undesired seed bank in a former rice field. However, the ability of target species to establish and persist in restored vegetation communities will require good management. Conditions with low competition in early stages of succession seem to be essential for transferred species to persist, and appropriately timed grazing and adequate stocking rates will be needed to limit the negative effects of competition."	9	0	0	0	8	0	9	2014-04-30	WOS:000332774800007	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How resistant and resilient are species-rich grasslands in terms of plant species richness and vegetation composition to short-term, small-scale perturbations caused by changes in management practice?Location: Bile Karpaty Mountains, SE Czech Republic.Methods: The experiment included the effect of six management regimes (mowing in June; mowing in September; mowing in June and September; mowing in June and high stubble left; no management; mowing in June and mulching). It was conducted in species-rich wooded grasslands in the White Carpathians Mts., Czech Republic, represented by three types of plant community: a Bromus erectus community (with high species richness and low productivity), a Molinia arundinacea community (with high species richness and high productivity), and a Calamagrostis epigejos community (with low species richness and high productivity). After 3yr, resistance was assessed, and traditional management (mowing once each year in June) was resumed; resilience was evaluated after three more years.Results: While the species-rich, unproductive Bromus community was relatively resistant to less intensive management in terms of species richness, and therefore its resilience could not be assessed, it changed substantially in terms of vegetation composition (maximum dissimilarity between control and abandoned plots was 63%). The more productive Molinia and Calamagrostis communities lost up to 37% of species due to abandonment, but not as a consequence of other changes management regimes. After the traditional management was resumed, resilience was higher in the Calamagrostis community than in the Molinia community. Vegetation composition was not affected by treatments.Conclusions: The results show that short-term abandonment causes loss of plant diversity in productive grasslands but not in less productive, species-rich grasslands in the short term. Other relaxed management regimes (e.g. high stubble and delayed mowing) were comparable with the control and can be used for a short time to increase diversity of management without an effect on plant species richness.

Are artificial neural networks (ANNs) a better statistical tool to model variations in grassland functioning compared to linear regression models (LRMs)? Location Tandilia Range, Southern Pampa, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Methods We characterized the dynamics of the vegetation functioning in 60 remnant grasslands using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data provided by MODIS/Terra images from July 2000 to June 2005. First, we performed a principal components analysis (PCA) on the fragment mean monthly values of EVI in order to obtain synthetic measures (i.e. the PCA axes) of grassland functioning. Grassland fragments were also characterized by size, vegetation structure (abundance of the tall-tussock grass Paspalum quadrifarium) and physical environment (soil type - abundance of litholitic soils - elevation, aspect and slope). The relationship between grassland functioning and these explanatory variables was explored using linear regression models (LRMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Results The first and second PCA axes were related to the annual integral of EVI (EVI-I) and EVI seasonality (EVI-S), respectively; these explained jointly ca. 80% of total variability in mean EVI values. ANNs captured better than regression models the relationships among the proposed controls and the spatial variability of grassland functioning in Southern Pampa. Results showed that EVI-I variability was related to all independent variables except aspect. While fragment size, litholitic soils and slope were negatively related to EVI-I, the abundance of P.quadrifarium had a positive effect on the spectral index.

Disturbance and recovery in semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	16	3	NA	NA	417	425	NA	10.1111/avsc.12013	Article	JUL 2013	2013	"Aims (1) To investigate the temporal response of semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands to multiple disturbances as well as P fertilization and irrigation; and (2) to determine the reaction of single species or groups of species as well as the extent of recovery of the grassland community following cessation of the above interventions. Location North Greece. Methods In a fenced area, six treatments (burning, irrigation, digging, cutting, P fertilization and control) were applied, for three growing seasons, in a completely randomized block design with four blocks. Biomass was sampled in five (0.5x0.5m) quadrats per plot at the end of the growing season and sorted into the following functional groups: annual grasses, perennial grasses, annual legumes and forbs (that included all the other species). Measurements were repeated 1 and 7yr after cessation of the treatments. Results Annual grasses and legumes were positively favoured by cutting, burning and digging, which produced changes in vegetation composition over time. P fertilization had a positive influence on total legume biomass. Effects on individual species were not uniform. Plant composition after cessation of the disturbance treatments was quite different. Total legume biomass remained high 1yr after the cessation of P fertilization but declined thereafter. Annual grasses and legumes constituted the largest portion of the total biomass in the first year of the experiment. Disturbance (burning, cutting and digging) gradually reduced their biomass in favour of forbs. Seven years after cessation of the treatments, the tall annual, as well as perennial grasses constituted more than 80% of the total biomass. Under conditions of disturbance, short annual species had an advantage over perennials, while cessation of disturbance enables perennial grasses to dominate. Conclusions Disturbance promotes the dominance of annuals, especially species with a persistent seed bank. Repeated disturbance encourages an increase of small or prostrate species. Cessation of disturbance leads to the rapid recovery of biomass production. Tall annuals are promoted. P fertilization clearly favours legumes in the short term."	6	0	0	0	6	0	7	2013-07-01	WOS:000319885000007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

These axes define what we will call Structural-Functional State and Transition Model (SFSTM). Both axes of SFSTM make it possible to determine and quantify states and transitions, critical thresholds and to evaluate the resistance and resilience of an ecosystem to a given disturbance. The critical threshold is identified by structural and functional thresholds (x and y axes), thus defining the point where the ecosystem loses its resilience. Furthermore, in the supplementary file we provide examples with field data from Patagonia to illustrate the SFSTM. The proposed SFSTM has large implications for rangeland research and management, facilitating the understanding and integration of key concepts to enhance the STM.

To reveal links between management practice and the occurrence of S. aquaticus, a survey was carried out on agricultural grassland in the summer of 2005.Location: The Mountain region in the northern and central part of Switzerland.Methods: Botanical assessments were carried out on management units (parcels) where S. aquaticus occurred and on neighbouring parcels without occurrence. For all parcels, we analysed the soil nutrients and the details of management such as intensity of fertilisation and defoliation frequency.Results: There was a high risk of S. aquaticus occurrence in parcels with low nitrogen fertilisation, a change of management intensity in the preceding 15 years, high inclination, and gaps in the sward. The change in the vegetation composition caused by altering the management intensity most probably provided gaps in the sward. which were then colonised by S. aquaticus. A novel finding is that. despite its preference for low-nutrient sites. the species was also persistent at sites with a moderate to high management intensity.Conclusion: A long-term control of S. aquaticus on agricultural grasslands can best be achieved by avoiding sward damage and by promoting dense and stable swards. The management should be adjusted to the local environmental conditions and the requirements of the favourable plant species. This could prevent the spread of S. aquaticus from the protected wetlands onto agricultural grasslands, where the species would threaten animal health."	20	0	0	0	18	0	21	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Trillium catesbaei is the most common Trillium species at the three study sites, but smaller in stature, shorter lived, and more of a habitat generalist.Results: Chronic herbivory in CC has created a highly-truncated age structure with no plants older than 9 years, while plant ages at the other sites were more evenly distributed. Compared to WOS, plants in CC were younger at a given height and more likely to flower when younger. Across all life stages, populations at CC contained 68 x fewer plants than WOS. The age structures of WOS and LBR were similar. Compared to published age estimates for other Trillium species, our results suggest that T. catesbaei is relatively short lived within the genus.Conclusions: Chronic herbivory had pronounced effects on the population structure of a perennial herb. Other long-lived herbaceous species may exhibit similar truncated age structures and flowering by younger and smaller plants. Habitat generalist species within a genus, such as T. catesbaei, that are able to reproduce more quickly may persist longer under chronic herbivory. However, chronic herbivory has likely caused the loss of herbaceous species from CC and may eventually cause the local extirpation of T. catesbaei populations."	24	0	0	0	23	0	29	2007-12-01	WOS:000250089300016	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

To what extent do these different treatments affect productivity and sward structure of an agriculturally improved grassland?Location: A mesic lowland grassland near Gottingen, Lower Saxony. Germany.Methods: Recruitment success of eight sown wildflower species was studied in a permanent grassland treated by a factorial combination of different pre-sowing cutting intervals (1.3 or 9 wk). post-sowing cutting intervals (1, 3 or 9 wk) and disturbance (control. harrowing, removal of sward). Seedling emergence and survival. biomass production and sward structure were followed over two years.Results: For most species seedling emergence was highest in the harrowing treatment. The complete sward removal did not further increase seedling emergence. Seedling survival was strongly influenced by the post-sowing cutting frequency with highest mortality in the 9 wk cutting interval compared to one and 3 wk cutting intervals. Annual dry matter yield varied between 4.4, 5.9 and 9.4 t.ha(-1) in the 1, 3 and 9 wk pre-sowing cutting treatment, respectively. In June, when the seeds were sown. the tiller number of the I wk cut plots was twice as high as for the 9 wk cut plots and five times higher than in the harrowing treatment.Conclusions: Disturbance by harrowing provided the optimal environmental cues to trigger germination, whereas seedling survival was facilitated by increased light penetration due to frequent cutting.

The pH of the various peat substrates was increased by adding different amounts of lime: 0-2 to 4-8 g-CaCO3.kg(-1) fresh peat. Both peat type and lime addition were found to affect the buoyancy of the peat substrates. Low nutrient concentrations in the peat, together with a high bulk density, proved to be unfavourable for creating floating peat. Three of the peat types proved to be too acidic (pH < 4.5) to produce sufficient methane (ca. 400-600 mumol.L-1), and buoyancy was only achieved if lime was mixed in with the peat. The smallest amount of lime added (2 g.kg(-1) fresh peat) was sufficient to maintain buoyancy for at least one year. Lime addition did not stimulate nutrient mobilization by mineralization, although P, N and K concentrations in the peat water were relatively high. It is concluded that floating peat can be initiated by the introduction of poorly humified peat. If the peat substrates are too acidic, lime can be added to stimulate buoyancy of the peat.

A small-scale restoration experiment concerning a species-rich calcareous grassland was conducted over a 7-yr period. 20 yr of abandonment (1971-1990) resulted in both a strong reduction of the number of species and an absolute dominance of the shrub Crataegus monogyna and the grass Brachypodium pinnatum - which contributed 98% of the above-ground herb phytomass. The plot (3 m x 6 m) was cleared in September 1990 and thereafter yearly mown in autumn. Small soil seed bank samples were taken immediately after clearing and again in the autumn of 1996. The inner part of the plot showed a reduced soil seed bank compared to the plot underneath the vegetation outside the plot in 1990. Six years later an increased number of seeds in the soil in this inside area could be recorded mainly in the upper soil layer, although the amount was only 40% compared to the outside or control area. Ca. 20% of the species present in the restored vegetation were recorded in seed traps during the main seed dispersal period in 1997. Restoration of high species richness in the plot was a fast process during the first few years: from seven species in 1990 towards 39 three years later. This was significantly faster than the restoration process of the calcareous grassland at the same slope 20 yr earlier. This was probably due to the increased size of the community species pool at the site as a result of appropriate management during the last decades. Relative species number increase was highest at the largest scale during this experiment, viz. at the total plot area. The success of restoration of species-rich, dry grassland vegetation largely depends on the interaction between several conditions, e.g. seed availability, either originating from the seed rain or soil seed bank, favourable germination conditions and a successful development to a mature, seed producing individual. Germination and establishment strongly depend on suitable vegetation structure as a result of sustainable management."	95	8	0	0	77	1	118	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800011	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Exotic herbivores and fire energy drive standing herbaceous biomass but do not alter compositional patterns in a semiarid savanna ecosystem	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	26	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12749	10.1111/avsc.12749	Article	OCT 2023	2023	"QuestionsFire regime alterations are pushing open ecosystems worldwide past tipping points where alternative steady states characterized by woody dominance prevail. This reduces the frequency and intensity of surface fires, further limiting their effectiveness for controlling cover of woody plants. In addition, grazing pressure (exotic or native grazers) can reinforce woody encroachment by potentially reducing fine-fuel loads. We investigated the effects of different fire energies on the herbaceous plant community, together with mammalian wildlife herbivory (exotic and native combined) exclusion, to inform best management practices.LocationTexas semi-arid savanna, southern Great Plains, USA.MethodsWe conducted an experiment in which we manipulated fire intensity and herbivore access to herbaceous biomass in a split-plot design. We altered fire energy via fuel addition rather than applying fire under different environmental conditions to control for differences in standing biomass and composition attributable to differential plant physiological status and fire season.ResultsHigh-energy fire did not reduce herbaceous biomass or alter plant community composition, although it did increase among-plot variability in composition and forb biomass relative to low-energy fire and non-burned controls. Grazing pressure from native and non-native mammalian herbivores reduced above-ground herbaceous biomass regardless of fire treatments, but did not alter community composition.ConclusionsManagers seeking to apply high-intensity prescribed fire to reduce woody encroachment will not negatively impact herbaceous plant productivity or alter community composition. However, they should be cognizant that repeated fires necessary for greatly reducing woody plants in heavily invaded areas might be difficult to accomplish due to fine-fuel reduction from wild herbivores. High fencing to restrict access by wildlife herbivores or culling might be necessary to build fuels sufficient to conduct high-intensity burns for woody-plant reduction.We conducted an experiment manipulating fire energy and herbivore access to herbaceous biomass in a well-replicated, split-plot design. Managers seeking to apply high-intensity prescribed fire to reduce woody encroachment will not negatively impact herbaceous plant productivity or alter community compositional trajectories.

The influence of external factors on internal regulation processes might depend on ecological state, and thus, on system resilience. We asked if well-conserved (reference) states have higher resilience to external factors than degraded states, considering the greater capacity for self-regulation expected of reference states. Location Graminous-subshrubby steppes of northern Patagonia, Argentina. Methods During four years, we assessed the influence of an external factor (rainfall variability) on internal regulation processes (seedling recruitment, growth of main perennial species, and three resilience proxies) in two alternative states (one reference and another degraded) of graminous-subshrubby steppes of northern Patagonia (Argentina). Specifically, we assessed the response of alternative states to simulated high rainfall events (irrigation). Results The degraded state was more sensitive to rainfall variability than the reference state. Specifically, in the degraded state the density of surviving seedlings, the growth of shrubs and Papostipa speciosa's relative tiller production and cover increased in response to irrigation; whereas seedling emergence and survival, and grass growth were low or even null without irrigation. Finally, resistance and elasticity were lower whereas malleability was greater in degraded than in reference states. Conclusions The degraded state was less resilient (low resistance and elasticity; high malleability) to stochastic weather events (in response to either increases or decreases in water availability. In contrast, the reference state had a great capacity to respond to rainfall variability. However, demographic processes such as seedling recruitment and vegetative growth were compensated by competition and mortality, suggesting a lower sensitivity to external drivers, and thus, a greater stability. By influencing the balance between equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics, degradation might affect the resilience and stability of the ecosystem. Thus, to prevent rangeland degradation, management plans should anticipate climatically favorable and unfavorable periods."	5	0	0	0	2	0	6	2022-09-11	WOS:000850042800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

There is a controversial discussion (a) whether soil preparation is required to reduce competition of pre-existing vegetation, or whether vegetation cover facilitate seedling recruitment, and (b) whether grazing should be excluded in initial stages of grassland restoration to protect seedlings, because grazing exclusion may also favour competitive ruderal species. We set up a combined soil preparation and grazing experiment to evaluate the effect of both factors on seedling recruitment of seeds transferred from a species-rich donor site.Location Upper Durance valley, Hautes-Alpes, France.Methods The experiment was set up using a full factorial split-plot design with five replicate sites. The treatments included soil preparation (harrowed or not) and grazing (excluded or not). Seeds were transferred using plant material brushed in a non-degraded reference grassland. The individuals of all occurring species were counted on the restoration sites, and the survival and reproduction of two focal species, Bromopsis erecta and Rhinanthus alectorolophus, were recorded for three months.Results Soil preparation by harrowing reduced the density of spontaneously emerging species and increased the seedling density of species transferred from the donor site. Grazing had only a weak negative effect on the recruitment of transferred species. The main effect of both treatments on seedling survival was not significant, but a significant interaction indicated that the grazing effect depended on soil preparation, with a negative effect of grazing only in non-harrowed plots.Conclusions The reduction of competition by soil preparation before seed addition of brush material had a positive effect on the seedling recruitment of transferred species and can thus clearly be recommended in our study system.

We applied three plant introduction treatments at a highly degraded industrial area to test whether plant material introduced onto industrial areas initiates plant assemblages similar in composition to those of reference grasslands. We specifically asked (a) Does restoration differ between primary and secondary reference sites in terms of overall species richness and cover three years after the introduction of plant material? (b) What is the sociability of species of the vegetation resulting from different treatments? Location Restoration and reference grassland sites with acidic sandy soil in the temperate region of the EU, NE Hungary, Nyirseg. Methods As restoration techniques, we (a) directly seeded a single dominant species, (b) applied a commercial seed mixture, and (c) transferred hay. We compared species composition, cover, species richness and sociability of species in restoration treatments to reference grasslands. Inventories of vascular plant species were made at five randomly placed 2 m x 2 m sampling units per plot. Results The species composition of seeded restoration plots (with a single dominant species and a commercial seed mixture) became similar to that of reference grasslands. Both types of seeding resulted in a similar cover, whereas seeding a commercial seed mixture and hay transfer resulted in a species richness similar to that of reference grasslands. The cover of the natural constituents (NC) of seeded plots also reached that of reference grasslands, while hay addition resulted in a lower cover and a higher number of NC than other methods. Conclusions The introduction of propagules in degraded industrial areas can provide communities similar, after three years, to those of secondary reference grasslands that are 30 years of age. We conclude that investing in the restoration of native grasslands at unused urban-industrial sites can be a great opportunity to enhance biodiversity."	30	0	0	0	25	0	34	2019-01-01	WOS:000459825800014	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What is the effect of a single accidental fire event on this grassland community?Location: Continental dry steppe-like grassland, Suatu and Puini, Transylvania, Romania.Methods: In two long-term abandoned grassland sites, we experimentally carried out annual biomass removal by clipping and raking, and by raking alone over a period of 9 yr. We analysed the effect of the two planned treatments in both sites and that of an accidental fire in one of the sites on the structure and composition of vegetation. We applied a predominantly functional trait-based analysis, but the dominant species Stipa pulcherrima and Carex humilis were treated separately.Results: Annual biomass removal applied for 9 yr at one site favoured sub-dominant grasses and short-lived forbs over long-lived forbs and the two dominant species, and generated a successional shift to more open grassland. The clipping and raking treatment promoted plot-scale species richness when the grassland species pool was large enough. The number and abundance of Red-Listed species were not influenced by our treatments. The single accidental fire event at one of the sites negatively affected the two dominant species and promoted one of the sub-dominant grasses. In addition, burning in combination with abandonment and presence of stoloniferous grass species benefiting from fire decreased species richness. Variation in weather conditions, in particular the series of dry years during our experiment, caused significant changes in vegetation cover and the quantity of litter, and decreased the abundance of S. pulcherrima in both sites and that of long-lived forbs in one site.Conclusions: According to our results, biomass removal had a beneficial effect on vegetation structure and composition in long-term abandoned steppe-like grassland.

There is especially a lack of large-scale, multi-site studies. We asked how many unsown target species established spontaneously in restored dry grasslands and how spontaneous establishment depended on their occurrence in the surrounding landscape.Location: White Carpathian Mts., eastern Czech Republic (48 degrees 500-49 degrees 050 N, 17 degrees 190-17 degrees 550 E, 250-610 ma.s.l.).Methods: We studied spontaneous colonization by unsown target species in dry grasslands on ex-arable land at 82 sites, sown with a regional seed mixture, commercial clover-grass seed mixtures or left to spontaneous succession. In total, 246 phytosociological releves in 5-m 9 5-m plots were recorded. Restoration started 1-31 yr ago. Nearby semi-natural grasslands were included as reference sites (94 phytosociological releves). A total of 108 target species were defined and their presence evaluated in the surroundings of the restored grasslands, i.e., in grid cells (3.1 km 9 2.8 km) in which the restored sites were situated. Datawere processed usingmultivariate analyses (DCA, CCA) and GLM.Results: The number of target species at the restored sites significantly increased with time elapsed since restoration started and the number of target species occurring in the surroundings. The sites, although restored in different ways, converged in their species composition towards ancient grasslands. The maximum relative colonization of a restored grassland by target species from the surroundings was 23.4%, and the restored grasslands contained max. Fifty-seven percent of the average number of dry grassland target species present in the ancient grasslands.Conclusions: Sowing seed mixtures should be seen as not more than a first phase in the restoration of species-rich grasslands. In a next phase of restoration, we can reasonably rely on gradual spontaneous colonization by target species if they occur in the surroundings, even at sites sown with commercial seed mixtures or restoring spontaneously. However, full restoration probably takes decades or more."	42	1	0	0	40	0	45	2015-04-01	WOS:000352131500003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What is the impact of sheep grazing on the restoration of this ecosystem? How can we rapidly evaluate the success of restoration methods?Location: Nature reserve of the plain of La Crau, southeast France (43 degrees 31' N, 4 degrees 50' E)Methods: In an ex-arable field, we sowed an indigenous species mix in 2007. This was composed of two perennial species dominant in the reference grassland ecosystem(Brachypodium retusum, Thymus vulgaris) and one annual species (Trifolium subterraneum) also found on the reference grassland and which is well-known for its ability to quickly cover bare soil. These three species are called foundation species as they play an essential role in structuring the restored ecosystem community. To investigate the significances of the foundation species on community dynamics, four subordinate species were sown 1 yr later: Taeniatherum caput-medusae, Linum strictum, Evax pygmaea and Asphodelus ayardii. The subordinate species are typical plants of the reference grassland which describe well this vegetation type.Results: Sowing foundation species was an effective means of reintroducing them. Their presence in the ex-arable field very rapidly promoted establishment of grassland species and impeded establishment of weeds. When grazing was excluded, the foundation species covered the ground, particularly with Trifolium subterraneum, which reached 54% ground cover. Subordinate species established better on the foundation species sown treatment and on the grazed treatment.Conclusion: In the short term, sowing indigenous foundation species and maintaining grazing seems to be a good method to restore grassland plant communities that have a poor ability to re-establish spontaneously. This study also demonstrates that sowing and monitoring of subordinate species is an effective method to rapidly test whether a particular restoration protocol will have a positive effect on community assembly and development."	23	0	0	0	20	0	24	2012-03-28	WOS:000301047300012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The managed fens, which had been drained for forestry during the 1970s and 1980s, were restored in 2007. The water table was monitored in all fens over four growing seasons during 2006 to 2009, and vegetation was surveyed from permanent sample plots in 2006 and 2009.Results: Before restoration in 2006, the water table was at a significantly lower level in the managed fens compared with the pristine fens. Immediately after restoration, the water table rose to the same level as in the pristine fens, and this change was permanent. Forest drainage had had little impact on the understorey vegetation of the managed fens in the three decades before restoration, with species typical of pristine fens still dominating the sites. Forest dwarf shrubs and feather mosses had started to increase in cover, but mire dwarf shrubs and Sphagnum mosses still dominated the managed fens. Only the typical hollow species Sphagnum majus, Sphagnum balticum and Scheuzeria palustris were missing from the managed fens. Two years after restoration, the changes in species composition were also marginal, with increased cover of mire dwarf shrubs and sedges being the only significant change.Conclusions: The success of restoration of oligotrophic pine fens seems likely, given that changes in hydrological functioning occurred rapidly, and since little change has occurred in the vegetation composition after draining. Speeding up the regeneration process in these peatland types by restoration may, therefore, be recommended, especially if the drainage effect extends to nearby pristine mires and influences their biodiversity."	46	0	0	0	38	0	52	2011-08-01	WOS:000292339800005	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

By documenting floristic composition and soil properties of grasslands with known cultivation histories, we established a conceptual model of the vegetation states that occur following cessation of cultivation and inferred transition pathways for community recovery.Results: Succession from an exotic-dominated grassland to native grassland followed a linear trajectory. These changes represent an increase in richness and cover of native forbs, a decrease in cover of exotic annual species and little change in native perennial graminoids and exotic perennial forbs. Using a state-and-transition model, two distinct vegetation states were evident: (1) an unstable, recently cultivated state, dominated by exotic annuals, and (2) a more diverse, stable state. The last-mentioned state can be divided into two further states based on species composition: (1) a never-cultivated state dominated by native perennial shrubs and grasses, and (2) a long-uncultivated state dominated by a small number of native perennial and native and exotic annual species that is best described as a subset of the never-cultivated state. Transitions between these states are hypothesized to be dependent upon landscape context, seed availability and soil recovery.Conclusions: Legacies of past land use on soils and vegetation of semi-arid grasslands are not as persistent as in other Australian communities. Recovery appears to follow a linear, directional model of post-disturbance regeneration which may be advanced by overcoming dispersal barriers hypothesised to restrict recovery."	32	0	0	0	29	0	38	2010-10-01	WOS:000281556100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The treatments produced a change in community structure and dominant species, from the woody seeder Ulex parviflorus to the resprouter grass Brachypodium retusum. Vegetation response was conditioned by both shrubland developmental stage and treatment applied. Burning resulted in more severe modification of the ecosystem, increasing bare soil cover. Four years after fuel management in different aged Mediterranean gorse shrublands, vegetation response followed a similar pattern with the exception of the young, brush-chipped shrublands.

We developed a grid-based computer model simulating the population dynamics of Grewia flava, a common, fleshy-fruited encroaching shrub. In the absence of large herbivores, seeds of Grewia are largely deposited in the sub-canopy of Acacia erioloba. Cattle negate this dispersal limitation by browsing on the foliage of Grewia and dispersing seeds into the grassland matrix. In this study we first show that model predictions of Grewia cover dynamics are realistic by comparing model output with shrub cover estimates obtained from a time series of aerial photographs. Subsequently, we apply a realistic range of intensity of cattle-induced seed dispersal combined with potential precipitation and fire scenarios. Based on the simulation results we suggest that cattle may facilitate shrub encroachment of Grewia. The results show that the severity of shrub encroachment is governed by the intensity of seed dispersal. For a high seed dispersal intensity without fire (equivalent to a high stocking rate) the model predicts 56% shrub cover and 85% cell cover after 100 yr. With fire both recruitment and shrub cover are reduced, which may, under moderate intensities, prevent shrub encroachment. Climate change scenarios with two-fold higher frequencies of drought and wet years intensified shrub encroachment rates, although long-term mean of precipitation remained constant. As a management recommendation we suggest that shrub encroachment on rangelands may be counteracted by frequent fires and controlling cattle movements to areas with a high proportion of fruiting Grewia shrubs."	39	3	0	0	29	1	49	2004-05-01	WOS:000221960200011	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Therefore the majority of plant species are expected to appear at the initial phase of post-agricultural succession in mesic forest environment with moderate levels of resources. This hypothesis was tested with data from the Buell-Small Successional Study, NJ, USA, one of the longest continuous fine-scale studies of old-field succession. The study started in 1958, including old fields with different agricultural histories, landscape contexts, and times of abandonment. In each year of the study, the cover values of plant species were recorded in 48 permanent plots of 1 m(2) in each field. We analysed the temporal patterns of colonization at plot scale and related these to precipitation data and other community characteristics. The number of colonizing species decreased significantly after ca. 5 yr, coinciding with the development of a continuous canopy of perennial species. However, species turnover remained high throughout the whole successional sequence. The most remarkable phenomenon is the high inter-annual variation of all studied characteristics. We found considerable temporal collapses of vegetation cover that were synchronized among fields despite their different developmental stages and distinctive species compositions. Declines of total cover were correlated with drought events. These events were associated with peaks of local species extinctions and were followed by increased colonization rates. The transitions of major successional stages were often connected to these events. We suggest that plant colonization windows opened by extreme weather events during succession offer optimum periods for intervention in restoration practice."	92	0	0	0	83	2	114	2003-12-01	WOS:000220133300013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The waste consists of marl and lime regolith, very poor in nutrients and structure (Poch et al. 1989). The dumps were terraced in 1985-1986 some were left for spontaneous re-colonization and others were reclaimed in various ways. In 1992 we took 36 vegetation samples on the dumps, based on the point quadrat procedure, to evaluate the colonization status and the differences between reclamation techniques. The samples were analysed on the basis of their species composition (ecological groups and multivariate analysis) and structural aspects (coverage, diversity, etc.). Reclamation treatment results varied widely, most of the dumps showing a low degree of naturalness, Colonizing vegetation ranged from a mixture of opportunist and stress-resistant taxa, forming poorly covered surfaces on the dumps where colonization has been poor, to dense grasslands dominated by one (or a few) introduced competitive grass species, where reclamation procedures had been intensive. Sowing treatments, where pasture species were sown onto dumps, produced intermediate results, as resulting vegetation cover was similar to control plots and naturalness was low, but in a few cases they yielded more interesting swards, fairly dense and diverse, and including high numbers of spontaneous species.

Preservation of their plant species requires either the maintenance of the existing grasslands or the creation of new ones. To study the establishment and regeneration ability of plant species typical of dry grasslands we laid out in experiment on a former arable field in central Finland. We compared the success of 13 grassland species both in a theoretical situation with minimal competition and in competition with weeds. More than half of the species used were regionally rare. As a group, grassland plants reached the highest cover in the experimental plots in which outside competition was minimised by weeding. However, the total cover achieved by their sward remained as low as 60% in the third growing season. The ability of grassland plants to regenerate and disperse on a small scale was therefore considered to be moderately poor, The short-living species that were rare in the region where the study took place also had the greatest difficulties in establishment and survival in the experimental field. The preservation of rare species - i.e. those species in the most urgent need of protection - therefore appears to be difficult to achieve by habitat creation.

Since the construction in 1979 of a dam in the Logone floodplain in the Sahelo-Sudanian zone of Cameroon, annual inundations have decreased, reducing perennial vegetation as important grazing source for nomadic herds and wildlife during the dry season. Presently, possibilities exist to release excess water for floodplain rehabilitation. In 1994 a pilot release was executed, reflooding 200 km2, to verify predicted advantages. Vegetation has been studied from 1984 onwards along a transect covering flooded, recently reflooded and desiccated parts of the floodplain. Since 1993, the floristic composition has also been monitored in a grid in the centre of the impact zone. Cover of perennial grasses, most notably Echinochloa pyr amidalis and Oryza longistaminata increased from 41 to 61% in the reflooded zone. Vetiveria nigritana, a tussock grass that used to be dominant, disappeared slowly after the dam construction and has not shown a comeback. The cover of annual species, most notably Sorghum arundinaceum, a dominant annual grass only since the mid-1980s, decreased in the reflooded zone from 58% to 34%. If the present conversion rate of annual into perennial grassland is extrapolated, recovery towards a 100% perennial state may be reached after the 2003 flooding season. Apart from favourable climatic conditions, recovery might be dependent on the restoration of soil fertility, limiting an approach focusing on flooding depth only."	20	0	0	0	15	0	21	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200005	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The effects of grazing by cattle and horses on vegetation development were studied in the well-drained border zone of the Oostvaardersplassen nature reserve, a managed eutrophic wetland in the young Zuidelijk Flevoland polder in The Netherlands. At the start of the study period, 12 yr after the area was enclosed by dykes, the vegetation was dominated by Phragmites australis and tall herbs, particularly Cirsium arvense. Over the next 8 yr, different plant communities developed under different grazing regimes. In all communities, C. arvense was gradually replaced by Urtica dioica, and stands dominated by these two species expanded at the expense of P. australis. The shrub Sambucus nigra invaded the stands of C. arvense and U. dioica. Grazing affected the rate of these developments and the degree to which the grass Poa trivialis became dominant. When cattle were enclosed at a relatively high stocking rate in an area of Phragmites australis and tall herbaceous vegetation during summer, P. trivialis became dominant within 4 yr. The introduction of herbivores led to a faster spread of S. nigra, which contains cyanogenic glycosides which only ruminants can detoxify. Horses, as hind-gut fermenters, did not feed on S. nigra. Grazing pressure and herbivore species, therefore, are two important variables that can be used to manage the development of Phragmites- and shrub vegetation: the greater the grazing pressure by cattle or horses the greater the area dominated by grasses, and a relatively high grazing pressure by cattle will retard S. nigra expansion."	38	1	0	0	30	0	46	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The seed bank density (at 0 - 5 cm depth) ranged from 344 to 915 8 seeds/m2 in the dry season and 172 to 5107 seeds/m2 in the wet season. The seed bank was very heterogeneous, both spatially and temporally, and it showed significant variation in size and composition in both sampling periods. The species similarity between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation in all plots was low (S Phi rensen's index = 0.000.44). The highest similarity was found in the recently grazed area.

The decision was taken by an opencast coal mining company to translocate on-site blanket bog vegetation, on completion of mining, at a site in Co. Durham, UK, both to preserve it and to use it to enhance recolonization. The vegetation of the treatments was monitored for seven years after site completion and this paper reports on the progress of the translocated material and its effect on recolonization. Translocation of large turves of blanket bog into carefully prepared receptor cells preserved most of the vegetation intact, but resulted in severe decline in the frequency of Sphagnum, while the design of the receptor site as strips of translocated vegetation enclosing strips of spread, stored peat accelerated recolonization of the intervening bare peat by Calluna vulgaris, but not of other target species. This attempt to translocate blanket bog vegetation and at the same time use it to accelerate recolonization was only partly successful. It was concluded that the ecological requirements of species known to be significant for ecosystem function, such as Sphagnum, must be fulfilled if translocation of blanket bog is to be attempted in future."	7	0	0	0	5	0	8	1999-12-01	WOS:000208472100003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Land use legacies affect early tropical forest succession in Mexico	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	27	2	NA	NA	NA	NA	e12784	10.1111/avsc.12784	Article	APR 2024	2024	"QuestionsAgricultural expansion is one of the dominant drivers of forest and biodiversity loss, and shifting cultivation is the most widely used form of agriculture in many tropical forest regions. Where forests have been cleared, they have the potential to recover once the land is abandoned. However, legacies of land use are often overlooked in successional studies, and a deeper understanding of this legacy effect is needed to define efficient restoration practices using natural or assisted regeneration. Here, we analysed how land-use history affects soil properties and early succession on abandoned agricultural fields in two contrasting Mexican socio-ecological systems.LocationMexico, Oaxaca and Chiapas.MethodsWe sampled soil and monitored vegetation for 2 years after agricultural abandonment, and interviewed landowners about their land-use practices.ResultsLand-use practices were clearly influenced by landowners' social context (residence time, rural or urban origin), and topography and soil type also constrained or facilitated land-use practices. Soil characteristics were strongly affected by three land-use practices: mechanical tillage decreased soil N and K; frequent herbicide and pesticide use increased N and K; and for pasture systems, stocking density increased soil bulk density and decreased pH and N. High-intensity land management practices, specifically use of machinery, had the highest impact on early forest succession. When machinery was not used, the frequency of land-use practices, particularly weeding frequency, is the main factor influencing tree cover and sapling diversity.ConclusionsTo facilitate post-agricultural forest recovery, we recommend restoration efforts using natural regeneration in areas with low previous land-use intensity and frequency.Land-use practices have a strong effect on forest recovery. The implementation of high-intensity land management practices, specifically the use of machinery, had the highest impact on early forest succession.

LocationMols Laboratory, Denmark. MethodsWe investigated grazing exclosures in the rewilding area of the Mols Laboratory, four years after its establishment. We focused on moist to dry grassland vegetation, that is, excluding scrub and woodland. Each experimental block consisted of five 5 x 9 m plots, representing four fenced treatments, that is, summer-only grazing, winter-only grazing, full exclosure with annual autumn mowing and full exclosure with passive succession. The matrix (the fifth treatment) was grazed by large herbivores at close-to-natural densities, that is, regulated bottom-up by the carrying capacity of the area. Hence, even the seasonal grazing treatments were grazed at close-to-natural animal density. Quantitative plant community composition was assessed using the point-intercept method in 25 x 25 cm quadrats, supplemented with biomass calibration models based on additional quadrats, in which above-ground plant biomass was harvested after recording and the material sorted to species and weighed. Uniqueness was assessed as the sum of inverse range sizes for constituent species (unicity). ResultsWe found an appreciably higher plant species richness in grazing treatments than under both annual mowing and full exclosure, but only minor differences between seasonal grazing treatments. Uniqueness was highest in year-round and winter-only grazing and lowest in summer-only grazing. The forb:graminoid ratio tended to be high in the winter-only grazing treatment, whereas annual mowing was associated with dominance of graminoids over forbs. Full-exclosure plots had accumulation of litter and the lowest species richness. Initial heterogeneity between plots within blocks and a systematic difference between blocks in moist and dry grasslands may have diluted treatment effects at this early point after the onset of the experiment. Data analysis using the biomass estimates derived from the calibration models yielded only minor differences in the patterns described above, when compared to the results obtained using the raw number of intercepts. ConclusionsNaturalistic grazing is a goal in itself in ecological restoration, but also proposed as an efficient management tool to promote conservation of grassland plants and communities. We found both plant species richness and the prevalence of regionally rarer species (uni) to be higher with grazing than mowing or abandonment. Similarly, the tendency for forbs to prevail under grazing may translate into enhanced floral resources for anthophilous insects. Summer-only grazing at low density of large herbivores was not significantly different from winter-only and year-round grazing, but this treatment was much closer to natural grazing than intensive summer grazing typical of agri-environmental practices."	18	0	0	0	12	0	19	2023-08-21	WOS:000950908600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Location White Carpathian Mountains (Czech Republic). Methods We assessed the species composition of flowering and fruiting species and collected propagule samples from three ancient and three restored grasslands. From the measured parameters, we estimated seed production for particular fruiting species. We combined these reproductive parameters with data on plant traits and plant status. Results Flowering species in restored grasslands produced three times higher seed numbers and three times lower seed mass than flowering species in ancient grasslands. At ancient sites, most seeds belonged to meadow specialist species; at restored sites, seeds of ruderal and generalist species prevailed. Prior to mowing, in both grassland types the seed-producing species were characterised by a high capability of clonal reproduction, high leaf dry matter content, and wind pollination. After mowing, seed-producing species were insect-pollinated species at ancient sites. This reflects the dominance of grasses before mowing and of forbs after mowing. Conclusions Higher seed number, lower seed mass and lower reliance on pollinators in restored grasslands indicate a different ecosystem functionality related to these parameters, in comparison with ancient grasslands. Specifically, seeds act as source for generative regeneration of resident species while resources for pollinators and seed herbivores are reduced. This maintains a differentiation of restored and ancient grasslands not only in terms of species composition but also in their effect on other trophic levels."	4	0	0	0	5	0	5	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900008	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Which habitats are sensitive to management changes? Location Mosaic of open upland habitats, includingAgrostis-FestucaandNardusgrasslands,CarexandMoliniamires, bracken and wet heath, southern Highlands of Scotland, UK. Methods Four grazing treatments were started in 2002: (a) Continued grazing at 0.9 ewe/ha (control); (2) High - 2.7 ewe/ha; (c) Mixed - partial substitution of sheep by cattle; and (d) None. Vegetation was sampled at 25 permanently marked locations per plot every three years. Analysis assessed how grazing affected community-weighted means of selected traits at the whole plot level and community level. Results Whole plot level changes in trait means were negligible apart from a small reduction in height in the High and Mixed treatments and a shift to earlier flowering in the High treatment. At the community level, increased grazing generally led to a reduction in canopy height and earlier flowering. Both increased and reduced grazing reduced leaf dry matter content (LDMC) in the most preferred community,Agrostis-Festucagrassland, but reduced grazing increased LDMC in the least preferred community, wet heath. Cattle grazing reduced LDMC in bothAgrostis-Festucagrassland and wet heath and reduced height in bracken. Conclusions Despite significant changes in grazing there were only small changes in trait means over 15 years. The most preferred communities were less sensitive to grazing removal than expected; few species present can take advantage of reduced grazing. The least preferred communities were more sensitive to grazing removal than expected; they still contain species capable of exploiting this. The presence of more preferred communities in each plot meant increased grazing has less impact on communities of moderate and low preference. Cattle impacts were highest in the communities most sensitive to trampling, bracken and wet heath."	8	1	0	0	8	0	9	2020-07-02	WOS:000541488200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Location Long-term cattle grazing management experiment in subtropical Campos grassland, southern Brazil. Methods Fourteen experimental units (paddocks) maintained under seven grazing intensity treatments for 26 years. In each paddock, we recorded plant species cover and species functional traits in nine systematically located plots of 1 m(2). Nineteen functional traits were used in the ordination of species to identify main axes of trait variation. Functional diversity measured by Rao entropy was partitioned into alpha, beta and gamma components. We tested, by linear models, for the effects of grazing intensity on community-weighted mean traits and functional diversity components, using as traits the species scores on the PCA axes. Results The two main axes of trait variation suggest a separation in species by their functional strategies (acquisition-conservation and tolerance-avoidance trade-offs). Acquisitive and tolerant species increased while conservative and avoidant species decreased with grazing intensity. Rao quadratic entropy, considering the three spatial components, decreased with grazing intensity, but this trend was more accentuated with beta-diversity. Conclusions The long-term, strictly-managed grazing experiment allowed us to reveal the effect of not only grazing disturbance per se, but also of different grazing intensities. Under high grazing intensity, frequent and severe defoliation allows only the persistence of species similarly adapted to regrowth. Under low grazing intensity, the lack of frequent defoliation enables the development of species with high investment in strong and long-lived leaves. The partitioning of functional diversity revealed that the increase in functional diversity in areas with low grazing intensity is mostly due to an increase in heterogeneity among patches (beta-component). The double stratum vegetation structure: tussocks, which escape grazing control, and short-grazed patches often overgrazed, is maintained by grazer selectivity."	39	4	0	0	39	1	44	2019-01-01	WOS:000459825800005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Despite their considerable scientific, ecological and economic importance, knowledge of forest-steppes is limited, particularly at the continental scale. Here we provide an overview of Eurasian forest-steppes across the entire zone: (a) we propose an up-to-date definition of forest-steppes, (b) give a short physiogeographic outline, (c) delineate and briefly characterize the main forest-steppe regions, (d) explore forest-steppe biodiversity and conservation status, and (e) outline forest-steppe prospects under predicted climate change.LocationEurasia (29 degrees-56 degrees N, 16 degrees-139 degrees E).Results and ConclusionsForest-steppes are natural or near-natural vegetation complexes of arboreal and herbaceous components (typically distributed in a mosaic pattern) in the temperate zone, where the co-existence of forest and grassland is enabled primarily by the semi-humid to semi-arid climate, complemented by complex interactions of biotic and abiotic factors operating at multiple scales. This new definition includes lowland forest-grassland macromosaics (e.g. in Eastern Europe), exposure-related mountain forest-steppes (e.g. in Inner Asia), fine-scale forest-grassland mosaics (e.g. in the Carpathian Basin) and open woodlands (e.g. in the Middle East). Using criteria of flora, physiognomy, relief and climate, nine main forest-steppe regions are identified and characterized. Forest-steppes are not simple two-phase systems, as they show a high level of habitat diversity, with forest and grassland patches of varying types and sizes, connected by a network of differently oriented edges. Species diversity and functional diversity may also be exceptionally high in forest-steppes. Regarding conservation, we conclude that major knowledge gaps exist in determining priorities at the continental, regional, national and local levels, and in identifying clear target states and optimal management strategies. When combined with other threats, climate change may be particularly dangerous to forest-steppe survival, possibly resulting in compositional changes, rearrangement of the landscape mosaic or even the latitudinal or altitudinal shift of forest-steppes."	150	6	0	0	110	0	169	2018-07-01	WOS:000442660900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We compared understorey plant species richness and community composition between the surveys and tested for temporal changes in the spatial heterogeneity (-diversity) of vegetation.ResultsSpecies richness and dissimilarity in species composition among plots decreased significantly between the surveys. The vegetation of the plots also changed significantly, but there were no clear directional changes across all plots. The vegetation homogenization was driven by local extinctions of specialist species, especially competitively weak species adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Few generalist species expanded between the surveys.ConclusionsWe found evidence of taxonomic homogenization of forest understoreys across a large sub-montane region. This vegetation homogenization was probably driven by complex landscape changes that took place in the last century. Varied traditional management regimes were replaced with largely uniform management, and the once spatially diverse landscape mosaic has become simpler. The resulting transition to species-poor and less variable vegetation was probably further accelerated by environmental eutrophication. Our results thus complement previous forest herb layer resurveys, which focused mostly on lowland forests and small nature reserves, and suggest that landscape-scale taxonomic homogenization is occurring across Central European forests."	31	0	0	0	27	0	33	2018-07-01	WOS:000442660900003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Vegetation assessments (cover estimates, seed rain) were done surrounding these patches in the third and fourth growing seasons.ResultsThere was significant egress of species from the patches into the peat after four growing seasons, and overall species associated with the patches had higher cover in the peat than species that were associated with the peat itself. While wind-dispersed herbaceous species from the patches were found at the leading edge of the egressing community, most species used vegetative propagation, resulting in short egress distances. Several patch-associated species were found in seed rain collected on the peat areas but were not observed in this material, suggesting seedbed limitations.ConclusionDespite the relatively short distance of egress, this experiment suggests that placement of propagule-rich soil material within reclaimed landscapes will promote egress into adjacent propagule-poor soil material."	5	0	0	0	5	0	6	2018-12-28	WOS:000425120600011	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Regression trees and linearmixedmodellingwere used to identify themain drivers of change between 1976 and 2010. Results: There were losses of habitat to erosion (4.7% of previously visited quadrats) and development (2.3%). Species richness changes were largely positive where sand dune and machair habitats remain part of an agricultural management system in the Inner and southern part of the Outer Hebrides. Richness losses were driven by acidic deposition and reduced grazing. Compositional changes were less related to agricultural changes, climate change and pollutant deposition than species richness changes.

What kinds of driversmight be responsible for these changes? Are the thermophilous oak woods still rich in species or have they rather lost their diversity?Location: SudetesMts., SWPoland.Methods: The vegetation of thermophilous oak forests within four distinct areas was surveyed on 92 semi-permanent plots in the time periods from 1992 to 1994 and from 2010 to 2014. The overall pattern in vegetation changes, trends in species composition and site parameters, as well as the diversity of studied communities were analysed using ordination and permutation techniques.Results: The species composition of thermophilous oak forests has changed significantly. We recorded a decrease in the share of oligotrophic light-demanding species, whereas mesotrophic light-demanding and nitrophilous species showed an upward trend. Regarding the fourth group of shade-tolerant species, their share varied depending on the site. The analysis of habitat parameters revealed that the studied oak forest communities generally shifted from communities of moderately oligotrophic and mesic character towards forests growing on nutrient- richer but drier habitats. Interestingly, the observed change in species composition was not accompanied by the loss of biodiversity that has generally been reported in other types of thermophilous forests in Europe.Conclusions: Changes observed within thermophilous and previously coppiced oak forests of southwest Poland are going in a direction which has not been recognized so far in analogous communities. The transition of studied communities is probably a result of the cumulative influence of several drivers, the most crucial of which seem to be soil regeneration, after the period of intensive acidity caused by sulphur emission between 1960 and 2000, and decreasing moisture. The observed changes are independent of the type of forestmanagement (or the lack thereof) within the study sites."	22	1	0	0	18	0	23	2017-04-01	WOS:000398083700014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Are tree and non-tree assemblages structured by the same factors?LocationAtlantic Rain Forest, restored by planting an assemblage of high-diversity tree species, Brazil.MethodsWe measured plant colonization of restoration sites of different ages to evaluate restoration success in terms of species diversity, colonization by non-tree species and structure measures among stands. We used Procrustes analysis to test whether the same conditions that influence tree composition influence non-tree composition (congruence between non-trees and trees present on the same sites).ResultsMany structural aspects of recovering forests, e.g. tree basal area, canopy cover, height, tree richness, and non-tree floristic composition resembled a mature forest within five decades. Although tree species diversity increased according to restoration age of sites, planted sites did not recover the richness of all growth forms even after five decades of restoration, and particularly lacked climbers and epiphytes. We detected significant similarity between corresponding points (tree and non-tree composition) from separate ordinations only in the reference forest. Therefore, naturally assembled communities are more concordant than those originating from active restoration.ConclusionNon-tree assemblages respond to different factors than the tree assemblages in restoration sites. Hence, non-tree recovery may not result as a natural consequence of tree recovery, and specific restoration strategies for non-tree species must be applied. Tree richness recovered after two decades. Only half of the non-tree species richness was recovered in old restoration sites, but their composition similarity reached expected levels of reference values. Further studies will investigate if low richness of non-tree species is a consequence of low input of allochthonous propagules (landscape filter) or whether they are arriving but not establishing (environmental filter). Enrichment planting of non-tree species may be required if the problem is propagule input. We recommend enrichment planting should be implemented within 10yrs after initial restoration planting because of the need for trees as supporting structures. However, if propagules are arriving but not establishing, the solution is to detect which environmental filters are important and to manipulate them through forest management."	41	0	0	0	35	3	43	2016-10-01	WOS:000386136600012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Differences in seedling abundance, species richness and Jaccard similarity indices between burned and unburned areas were compared using GLMMs. Differences in the community composition were examined using pRDA.ResultsIn total, 24 of the 51 species in the vegetation were detected in the germinable seed bank. Species richness and the abundance of seedlings other than Calluna vulgaris were lower in areas where wildfires had occurred.

We did not find any evidence of significant interactions between burning and habitat, suggesting that wildfires had similar impacts on each species regardless of the habitat in which they occurred.ConclusionsThis study differs from other UK studies in that it examines impacts of wildfires at sites that have not been previously intensively managed by burning.

Do changes in component species correspond with changes across vegetation types? Do patterns of changes suggest potential drivers of change?Location: Northern two-thirds of the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, ca. 45 000 km(2).Methods: Using two data sets that cover the span of elevations and land jurisdictions in the study area, we classified 4321 historical plots and 1000 modern plots into nine broad groups of vegetation types that are widely used by land managers and researchers in the region. We compared tree density and composition between historical and modern plots across and within these nine types.Results: In the modern data set, tree density was significantly higher in eight of nine vegetation types. Total density was significantly higher in modern plots for all west slope types, especially for montane hardwood, where modern forests are 128% denser, and mixed conifer forests, which are 69% denser. Relative density of component species was also very different between data sets in these forests, and suggests a shift in dominance toward shade-tolerant conifers and evergreen oaks. Fire suppression is likely a driving factor in these types but density was also significantly higher in high-elevation types such as sub-alpine forest (+20%), where neither fire suppression nor logging have had major impacts on structure. East slope forest types (eastside P. jeffreyi forest and pinon-juniper woodland) were very similar in both modern and historical data sets, with no significant differences in density or composition.Conclusion: West slope forest types, especially montane hardwood and mixed conifer forest, appear the most altered types of the mountain range. These types are more productive but have also been subject to greater disturbance than high-elevation and east slope forest types. Climate change may also be driving changes across the study area.

However, differences in size structure between ungrazed and grazed paddocks were only detected in Mulinum. Demographic rates differed between shrub species, time-periods and grazing conditions. In particular, recruitment in the short term (especially in wet years) and population growth rate in the long term (l) were higher in paddocks excluded from grazing only in Mulinum populations. Senecio populations showed a marginal increase in recruitment and mortality independent of the grazing condition in the wet and dry period. Grazing exclusion modified the balance of neighborhood interactions among the three shrub species. In grazing-exclusion paddocks, there was a balance between positive and negative interspecific interactions, while in grazed paddocks there were more negative intraspecific and interspecific interactions, resulting in a net negative balance of neighborhood interactions.Conclusions: Our understanding of woody encroachment in arid rangelands can be informed through evaluation of direct and indirect effects of grazing exclusion on the abundance and demography of dominant woody species. In Patagonian arid steppes, the occurrence of woody encroachment in rangelands excluded from grazing can be explained by altered responses in plant-animal and plant-plant interactions among shrub species."	47	4	0	0	39	2	54	2012-02-16	WOS:000299207600005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The experiment was repeated again in May 2009 (autumn) and a succulent canopy species (P. afra) was added. We assessed restoration success in terms of the survival of planted individuals after 24 mo (spring planting) and 12 mo (autumn planting). The estimated cost of a restoration effort to establish two woody canopy dominant species with the large-scale planting of P. afra was calculated and compared with that of the already established protocol of planting only P. afra truncheons.Results: Survival after spring (24 mo) and autumn (12 mo) plantings of the two woody canopy species was less than 5%, whereas survival of L. ferocissimum was low (19%), R. obovatum good (70%) and P. afra excellent (100%). Contrary to expectations, survival was not related to a gradient of intactness encompassing degraded, restoration and intact treatments that are associated with increasing biomass and soil carbon. The costs of incorporating the four woody canopy species into the restoration programme's protocol were 2.4 times the costs of restoring with P. afra alone.Conclusions: Planting propagules of canopy species other than P. afra is likely to render the programme economically unfeasible, depending on the price of carbon. We conclude that biodiversity goals for the restoration programme are better achieved via spontaneous recruitment of woody canopy and other species, even though this may take more than 40 yr post restoration."	16	0	0	0	12	0	16	2012-02-16	WOS:000299207600004	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Short-term bryoid and vascular vegetation response to reforestation alternatives following wildfire in conifer plantations	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	14	3	NA	NA	326	339	NA	10.1111/j.1654-109X.2011.01129.x	Article	AUG 2011	2011	"Question: How are dynamics of early-seral post-fire vascular plant and bryoid (terrestrial mosses, lichens, and fungi) vegetation impacted by reforestation activities, particularly manual vegetation removal and planting density? Does the relationship between vegetation dynamics and vegetation removal differ between harsh (west-facing) and moderate (east-facing) aspects?Location: Five high-severity burn plantation forests of Pseudotsuga menziesii in southwestern Oregon, USA.Methods: Plantations severely burned in a recent wildfire were planted with conifer seedlings as a four-species mixture or a monoculture, at two different densities, with and without manual vegetation removal. A subset of plots was also planted on a contrasting aspect within each plantation. The contrasting aspects differed in potential solar insolation and were indicative of moderate (eastern exposure) and harsh (western exposure) site conditions. Covers of shrub, herbaceous and bryoid vegetation layers were measured during reforestation activities 2-4 yr after the fire. Dynamics of structural layer cover and community composition were compared among treatments with analysis of variance and multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling and blocked multi-response permutation procedure).Results: Structural layer cover and community composition differed between areas that received reforestation treatments and untreated areas. However, variability within treatments in a plantation was greater than variability within treatments across plantations. Effects of vegetation removal on composition and structure were more evident than effects of planting or altering planting density. Vegetation removal decreased cover of tall and low shrub and the bryoid layer, and increased herbaceous layer cover. Bryoid community and low shrub structural layer responses were more pronounced on moderate aspects than on harsh aspects. Vegetation removal shifted vascular plant community composition towards exotic and annual species.Conclusions: These reforestation treatments may be implemented without substantially altering early-seral vegetation community composition dynamics, especially in areas with harsh site conditions. Site conditions, such as aspect, should be evaluated to determine need and potential effects of reforestation before implementation. Monitoring for exotic species establishment should follow reforestation activities."	2	0	0	0	1	0	3	2011-07-16	WOS:000292339800004	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Six sites were sampled in each area. The vegetation was classified with cluster analysis.ResultsFour plant communities were defined in the area: Calluna vulgaris-Empetrum nigrum-Vaccinium myrtillus heath, Scirpus cespitosus-Eriophorum angustifolium blanket mire, Carex bigelowii-Racomitrium lanuginosum moss-heath, Narthecium ossifragum-Carex panacea mire. Heath was more extensively distributed within, and was the dominant community of the drained area, whereas moss-heath was more extensive in the undrained area. Blanket mire and mire had approximately the same distribution in both areas. For the blanket mire, species composition indicated drier conditions in the drained than in the undrained area. The drained area had higher frequencies of woody species and lichens, grasses had finer roots and available soil phosphate was considerably higher, whereas the undrained area had higher frequencies of grasses and sedges.ConclusionThe dominant plant communities were different in the two areas, which indicated that the blanket mire was drying in the drained area. Higher concentration of soil phosphate in the drained area also indicated increased decomposition of organic soils owing to desiccation."	2	0	0	0	2	0	2	2010-04-01	WOS:000274819200010	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Long-term monitoring data on the floristic composition of the established vegetation were obtained from the national conservation agency, and additional monitoring was undertaken in 2003. Floristic composition, seed weights, seed longevity of component species and Ellenberg indicator values were used to compare the seed bank and established vegetation.Results: The soil seed bank was diverse and contained typical dune slack species, species of early successional stages and species of conservation interest. A comparison between the composition of the seed bank and historical data on the composition of the established vegetation showed that the seed bank reflects earlier successional stages more closely than the current aboveground vegetation. This study increases the scarce information currently available on the seed bank ecology of several species, including two orchid species.Conclusions: The soil seed bank can be expected to contribute to vegetation change after disturbance.

This literature review addresses the role of seed dispersal by wind in wetlands. Why is wind dispersal relevant in wetlands? Which seeds are dispersed by wind and how far? And how can our understanding of wind dispersal be applied to wetland conservation and restoration?Methods: Literature review.Results and conclusions: Wind is a widely available seed dispersal vector in wetlands and can transport many seeds over long distances. Unlike water, wind can transport seeds in all directions and is therefore important for dispersal to upstream wetlands and to wetlands not connected by surface water flows. Wind dispersal transports seeds to a wider range of sites than water, and therefore reaches more sites but with lower seed densities.Many wetland plant species have adaptations to facilitate wind dispersal. Dispersal distances increase with decreasing falling velocity of seeds, increasing seed release height and selective release mechanisms. Depending on the adaptations, seeds may be dispersed by wind over many km or only a few m. The frequency of long-distance wind dispersal events depends on these adaptations, the number of produced seeds, the structure of the surrounding vegetation, and the frequency of occurrence of suitable weather conditions.Humans reduce the frequency of successful long-distance wind dispersal events in wetlands through wetland loss and fragmentation (which reduce the number and quality of seeds) and eutrophication (which changes the structure of the vegetation so that seed release into the wind flow becomes more difficult). This is yet another reason to focus on wetland conservation and restoration measures at increased population sizes, prevention of eutrophication, and the restoration of sites at short distances from seed sources."	82	1	0	0	76	1	97	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600013	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In the same forest areas, the soil seed bank was investigated using the seedling emergence method. Samples were obtained from soil cores in January 2003.Results: We found substantial changes in soil compaction, above-ground vegetation and in the soil seed bank due to recreational activities. In frequently visited areas, soil compaction was enhanced which caused a decrease in cover, height and species richness of both herb and shrub layers. Compared with control areas, the number of trampling-tolerant species of the seed bank was significantly higher in disturbed areas, and total species richness tended to be higher in disturbed than in control areas. Furthermore, the similarity in species composition between the above-ground vegetation and seed bank was significant lower in disturbed than in control areas.Conclusions: The intensive use of suburban forests for recreational activities, mainly picnicking, affects the vegetation of natural beech forests.

Location: Nature reserves in Flanders, Belgium. Methods: Epizoochory was studied by brushing plant seeds from the fur of 201 domesticated large herbivores (Galloway cattle. donkeys and horses), grazing in 27 Flemish nature reserves. Several herbivores were examined after transport between different nature reserves as part of the seasonal grazing system in Flanders, allowing detection of seed dispersal both within and between reserves. The seedling emergence method was used to identify the dispersed plant species. Results: In total. 6385 epizoochorous seeds from 75 species germinated, yet the real seed quantity was underestimated by the seedling emergence method. A wide variety of seed morphology. seed weights and plant heights was represented among the dispersed species. many of which had a transient seed bank. There was a gradual turnover in epizoochorous species composition in the course of the vegetation season, and seed dispersal occurred both within and between different nature reserves. Conclusions: Domesticated large herbivores, as models for wild mammals in the present and the past, are important dispersers of many plant species. Through seasonal grazing, the herbivores function as 'mobile link organisms', connecting isolated nature reserves through seed dispersal, possibly influencing vegetation development and long-term survival of plant populations. As such, large herbivores are important instruments in ecological restoration, especially in fragmented ecosystems."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2004-11-01	BCI:BCI200500082084	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In mown and a chronosequence of abandoned fen meadows spanning 35 yr, we measured fitness traits of the sedge Carex davalliana and the forb Succisa pratensis. Cessation of mowing had little effect on fitness traits and seed production of C. davalliana, but seedling density decreased more than threefold. Population density of S. pratensis decreased with increasing community biomass, but was not affected by the cessation of mowing. However, flowering frequency increased threefold and seed production was 20% higher in fallow meadows. Consequently, seedling density of S. pratensis increased nearly threefold after abandonment. However, these changes were not dependent on the age of the fallow. In a common garden and germination experiment, we found no differences in either species between plants from fallows and mown fen meadows, except for the height of the flowering stalk of S. pratensis. The combined results from the common garden experiment and the field studies indicate that changes in fitness traits observed in fallows were mostly phenotypic and likely to be reversible.

Local presence of plant species is determined by population colonizations and extinctions. All traits that influence the capacity of individuals to colonize patches and survive within patches, are therefore important for community diversity. Spatial models can explain the coexistence of species provided that the inferior competitor has a greater spatial mobility and thereby can avoid competition. We searched the literature for empirical evidence for such trade-offs and included all available information on correlations between traits associated with the capacity to colonize and traits promoting the ability to survive. A lower reproductive effort of a species is associated with a longer life span and a higher competitive ability. Morphological adaptations for dispersal are less common in species which better tolerate stress, that are better competitors or possess seed dormancy. Such patterns suggest that species that are good survivors may have a limited ability to colonize new patches and vice versa. A negative correlation between dispersability and longevity has important effects on the regional dynamics of single species as well as on the coexistence of species. From a conservation perspective differences in the colonization capacity among species imply that restoration of plant biodiversity must not only focus on conditions within patches, but also consider the spatial arrangement of patches in order to enable plants to bridge gaps in time and space."	74	1	0	0	45	0	82	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800006	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Solar park ecosystems combine artificial and semi-natural microhabitats depending on the influence of solar panels. We distinguished microhabitats outside panels (unshaded), inter-rows between panels (partial shading) and microhabitats under panels (constantly shaded).

We identified all vascular plant species and visually estimated their cover.ResultsThe microhabitat effect was significant for species richness, plant cover, and species composition. The plant species richness was on average 34% lower under than outside panels. The dissimilarity between under and outside panel plant species composition was explained by at least 17% of the species.

Vegetation structure is an ecosystem property influenced by management that has site selection and use implications for wildlife and livestock. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of patch-burn grazing to increase structural heterogeneity on semi-arid post-Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands in southwestern North Dakota. Location: Hettinger Research Extension Center in Hettinger, North Dakota. Methods: We surveyed plant community composition and structural characteristics in patch-burn grazing pastures during the 2017-2020 summer grazing seasons. Three pastures were stocked with cow-calf pairs and three were stocked with sheep. We also surveyed structural characteristics on units with conventional management (hay or idle) for active and post-CRP enrolled grasslands during the summers of 2018-2020. We tested for vegetative and structural differences between patches with varying time since fire and between grazer types on patch-burn pastures using mixed-effect models and ordination. We used variance partitioning to determine if structural contrast on patch-burn pastures increased over the study period and if structural contrast was higher on patch-burn grazing pastures relative to conventional management. Results: Time since fire was significant for all structural characteristics, with recently burned patches being different from other patches. There were no structural differences between cattle and sheep pastures, but forb and legume cover were lower in sheep pastures. Structural contrast on patch-burn pastures increased over the study and was greater than conventional management. Conclusions: Increased structural heterogeneity is important for supporting a broad suite of rangeland wildlife and can stabilize forage production. This study supports the expectation that patch-burn grazing with moderate stocking rates will increase structural contrast regardless of grazer type, but practitioners should consider which suites of species that management may benefit."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-03-08	WOS:001435561300001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The most common management is either grazing or mowing, or grasslands are abandoned. The differential effects of these management or abandoning schemes on biodiversity patterns of extensively managed grasslands have not yet been systematically evaluated with a large number of available case studies. We aimed to identify by a meta-analysis the best option for biodiversity in extensively managed grassland in Europe. Materials and Methods: Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched for publications that appeared before 31 January 2024 and that reported the effects of management schemes on biodiversity patterns of extensively managed grassland. Out of 971 original records, 54 full-text articles were included in the final analysis. We extracted values for mean, SD and sample size of species numbers and calculated Hedge's g to rate treatment effects. Results: Extensive management (grazing, mowing) increased species number compared to abandonment (effect size: Hedge's g = 1.30). For plant diversity, extensive management had a strong positive effect (g = 1.78), while the effect of grazing and mowing was minor for animal biodiversity (g = 0.03). The results were recognizably influenced by the investigated plot sizes. Small plots (<10 m(2)) showed a much stronger effect (g = 2.19) than larger plots (g = 0.56). The type of extensive management, grazing or mowing, had no influence on the results. Conclusion: In line with results on grasslands in general, our results underline that biodiversity of extensively managed grasslands benefits from extensive grazing or mowing. Although abandonment had a negligible effect on animal species richness, the effect on vegetation was strong. The low effect of abandonment on the fauna can be explained by the relatively short duration of the studies. The characteristics of grassland were still present, and it had not turned into forest. Extensive grazing or mowing are therefore the best options for grassland managed for conservation purposes."	5	0	0	0	4	0	5	2024-12-09	WOS:001369544900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Current pasture-based livestock production mainly occurs on intensified grasslands (IG) that have been agronomically improved. Although it is documented that SNG and IG differ in terms of plant diversity, their ability to provide ecosystem services (ES) in farmland is less explored. Here, we review the role of SNG and IG in delivering ES, illustrate their trade-offs and synergies, and examine how ES can be assessed by using plant traits and functional richness.Results: We found that SNG generate a wider range of ES than IG. Trade-offs exist between ES that appear more pronounced in IG between high biomass production and other ES. SNG are good in providing habitat for biodiversity, supporting pollination and cultural services. SNG also have a significantly wider range of plant functional traits and a higher functional richness, suggesting that the potential to supply ES in SNG is partly driven by higher number of species and their functional diversity.Conclusion: Clearer trade-offs were found in IG compared with SNG, supported both by the literature and the functional richness. This suggests that functional knowledge could be a good complement to understand the mechanisms behind ES generation and could help with tailoring grassland management to sustain biodiversity, ecological functions and ES.

Our objective was to evaluate the resilience to an extraordinary consecutive-droughts event, across an intensification gradient of livestock systems. Our prediction was that sites with more intensive management (less diverse) will have lower resilience (as resistance and/or recovery) to drought.Location South-central region of Uruguay.Methods We evaluated the resilience (as resistance and recovery) to consecutive droughts, across an intensification gradient of livestock systems. We analyzed the effect of diversity on resilience at two scales: (1) regional - an observational experiment with real commercial farms, where we compared three systems with an increasing level of intensification that determine changes in diversity, (2) patch - we carried out a manipulative experiment with different grazing management intensities determined by the level of biomass removal and fertilization. In both experiments, resistance and recovery were calculated from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index.Results The most intensified and less diverse management (sown pastures) had significantly lower resistance than native and overseeded grassland. Also, it showed the lowest recovery rate, and its productivity did not reach previous values after the drought's end. The grazing intensification gradient at the plot scale did not show clear differences among treatments both for resistance and recovery. However, resistance of the individual plots showed a positive significant association not only with species richness and diversity, but also with evenness and diversity of functional groups.Conclusion Our research supports the insurance hypothesis by demonstrating that farms with greater biodiversity (less intensive management) have higher resistance to drought. We found that species richness is not enough to account for the effect of diversity on resilience. Our results emphasize the importance of preserving grassland biodiversity to maintain resilient ecosystems in the face of climate change."	6	0	0	0	4	0	6	2023-09-25	WOS:000969129300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Here we ask to what extent the variation in above-ground biomass at the scale of quadrats is predictive of (1) community-weighted means (CWMs) of leaf traits and functional groups, and (2) functional diversity in grasslands.Location: Native grasslands (Campos) of northeastern Uruguay.Methods: Four paddocks of a replicated, randomized experiment, managed under high and low grazing pressure for 10 years, were monitored for above-ground biomass and species composition during autumn, winter and spring of 2017 using 20 cmx 20 cm permanent quadrats. Thirteen dominant species were assessed seasonally for leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf tensile strength (LTS), and leaf width (LW), which were used in cluster analysis to define functional groups. We computed CWMs and functional diversity at the quadrat scale, which we related to the above-ground biomass by using linear mixed models attached to a maximum per-mutation test.Results: We identified four functional groups (FGs A, B, C and D), which considered the phenological seasonality of species and thus the highly intra-functional group variability of leaf traits across seasons. Lower levels of biomass increased the dominance of species with lower LDMC and wider leaves (FG A and B), while higher levels of biomass increased species with higher LDMC and narrower leaves (FG D, represented by Nassella charruana), and increased the functional diversity.Conclusions: Fine-scale variation of above-ground biomass is predictive of functional composition and diversity in grazed grasslands.

Also, these disturbances affect plant community biodiversity and cover, which are also known to affect multiple ecosystem properties. However, the strength of the relative effects of the disturbance itself and of the effect that is mediated by changes in the plant community is still unclear. Questions We evaluated the relative direct and indirect effects (mediated by changes in the plant community) of the anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem multifunctionality. Location Dry forests within the Sustainable Development Reserve Ponta do Tubarao, northeastern Brazil. Methods We measured standing biomass, litter mass, soil fertility and soil water content in 52 vegetation plots along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Also, we measured woody plant cover and species' functional traits to characterize the plant community functional structure. We measured livestock grazing, selective logging and past clear-cuts as proxies of anthropogenic disturbance to create an index that characterizes the additive effect of these human activities. By building a theoretical model using the structural equation modelling approach, we investigated how the plant community changes in cover and biodiversity due to anthropogenic disturbances mediate changes in ecosystem properties. Results Our results show that anthropogenic disturbances had negative effects on ecosystem properties. Plant cover loss caused by anthropogenic disturbances was the major determinant of the negative effect of disturbances. The functional structure of the plant community had a weak effect on these properties. Conclusions By assessing the effect of human activities on multifunctionality, we found a stronger negative effect of anthropogenic disturbances when compared to its effect on single ecosystem properties. The recovery of plant cover should be a major focus of projects aiming to restore and maintain the multifunctionality of this dryland."	7	0	0	0	5	0	8	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000002	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We resurveyed the same transects in 2018 and accessed fire and climate data in order to examine trends in plant community structure. We asked the question: has the plant community shifted in species' density, canopy cover and diversity in the past 40 years since grazing cessation? And if so, do these shifts favor a specific species, or plant functional guild? We also asked if climate and time since fire influenced plant community structure?LocationSaguaro National Park East is located in the Sonoran Desert and Madrean Sky Island ecoregion interface in Tucson, Arizona, United States.MethodsPlots (10) were 20 m x 50 m, with 21 20-m transects within each plot used to gather plant canopy cover and density of perennial species with the line-intercept method. Data were aggregated by plot and analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling.ResultsOverall canopy cover, density, and Shannon diversity increased significantly between 1976 and 2018. Ferns, forbs, graminoids, subshrubs and vines increased significantly in cover and density between 1976 and 2018. Wildfire recency was significantly negatively correlated with forb density, and density or cover of five dominant species (mostly woody). Shifts in plant community structure between survey years was correlated with increased temperature, precipitation, and vapor pressure differential.ConclusionAfter 40 years of grazing cessation, significant increases in herbaceous cover, and a lack of significant increase in woody encroachment are signs of recovery. Increases in temperature may be responsible for accelerating shifts to warm-season species-dominant communities. Fire was unexpectedly not a significant factor in plant community structure; however, park management will likely need to address increased wildfire risk given the increase in herbaceous cover and density."	3	0	0	0	1	0	3	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Are patterns and trends consistent across two study regions? Do impacts of environmental changes onNardusgrasslands in Central Europe correspond to those identified in the European Atlantic biogeographic region? Location East Hesse Highlands, Germany. Methods In 2012-2015, we re-surveyed quasi-permanent plots that had been initially surveyed between 1971 and 1987, and re-measured soil parameters. We tested for differences in species frequency and cover, mean Ellenberg indicator values, species richness, and soil variables. Nitrogen and sulphur deposition data were analysed to evaluate possible effects of atmospheric pollutants. We used regression and redundancy analyses to identify environmental drivers responsible for changes in species composition. Results Across regions, we found significant increases in soil pH, EllenbergRandNindicator values, plant nutrient indicators, forbs, species of agricultural grasslands and of fallows. By contrast, the C:N ratio, Nardusgrassland specialists, low-nutrient indicators, and graminoids declined. Changes in species composition were related to changes in pH and management. There was a strong decrease in sulphur and a moderate increase in nitrogen deposition, whose local-scale pattern did not correlate with changes in soil parameters. However, there was an effect of local NH(y)changes on species composition. Conclusions The findings indicate significant overall eutrophication, a trend towards less acidic conditions and insufficient management, which are widely consistent across our study regions and correspond to recent reports of vegetation changes and recovery from acidification in the Atlantic biogeographic region. We assume the reduced sulphur deposition during recent decades to be a major driver of these changes, combined with increased nitrogen deposition and reduced management intensity. This suggests a large-scale validity of processes that influenced changes inNardusgrasslands of western and Central Europe."	26	0	0	0	24	0	26	2020-08-13	WOS:000558699300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To understand the impact of land use intensification on savanna vegetation, we aim to answer the following questions: How do savanna species composition, diversity and structure change with increasing land use pressure? Are the impacts of land use change different in the woody and the herbaceous layers? Do the effects of land use change differ between vegetation types? Location Southeastern Burkina Faso, West Africa. Methods Vegetation plots from the early 1990s representing vegetation types occurring in fallows of different age and in uncultivated pasturing zones were resurveyed. We distinguished between woody (tree and shrub layer) and herbaceous vegetation types. Species composition changes were analyzed using ordination techniques (detrended correspondence analysis, DCA) and indicator species analysis (IndVal). Species turnover and plant diversity as represented by species richness and evenness were compared between the baseline survey and the resurvey. Results In most woody vegetation types, we found no change in species composition and richness over the past two decades. However, some highly valued woody species decreased in abundance. In contrast, in most herbaceous vegetation types, species composition changed considerably and species richness increased. The proportion of wide-ranging, ruderal herbaceous species increased, indicating a homogenization of herbaceous vegetation types, while preferred fodder herbaceous species decreased. We assume that the increased grazing intensity over the past two decades is the driver of these changes in the herbaceous layer. Conclusions Our results show different reactions of vegetation types and layers to land use intensification and reinforce the need for studies on the basis of vegetation type that incorporate both the herbaceous and the woody layers."	16	0	0	0	12	0	17	2019-06-06	WOS:000466383400004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What were the main drivers of vegetation change?Location: Dransfeld Plateau, central Germany.Methods: Repetition of 85 historical semi-permanent vegetation plots located in 13 forest patches on limestone soil. Differences in species composition and plant functional types between historical and recent plots were analysed using a blockmulti-response permutation procedure (bMRPP), NMDS, indicator species analysis (ISA) and ANOVA.Results: We found significant changes in all vegetation layers. In the tree layer, Fagus sylvatica and Hedera helix had increased, while Quercus robur and Carpinus betulus had decreased. In the understorey, tree regeneration had strongly increased. In the herbaceous layer, species richness had decreased from 30 to 24 species per 100 m y, and the abundance of plant functional types had changed: the proportion of geophytes and therophytes had increased, while the proportion of hemicryptophytes had decreased. Spring-green species (i.e. species active mainly before tree foliation) had increased, while summer-green species had decreased. In addition, the estimated mean SLA of herbaceous species had increased. The proportion of closed-forest species had slightly increased, while the proportion of species of forest edges and clearings had decreased.

Do different functional groups respond differently to these factors?Location: Norholm heathland, southwest Denmark.Methods: We recorded the overstorey and ground vegetation along with environmental variables in 129 plots on a 350 ha heathland where management ceased more than 100 yrs ago. We used structural equation models (SEM) to examine the relationship between species richness of functional groups (herbs, dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings) and ground vegetation cover, overstorey development, distance to the edge and nutrient availability.Results: The relative importance of the driving factors differed between functional groups. Herb richness increased with increasing nutrient availability from previous land use and decreased with overstorey development. Dwarf shrub richness responded negatively to overstorey development and herb cover. In contrast, species richness of tree seedlings responded strongly and positively to overstorey development but not to environmental variables or ground vegetation. In general, the effect of nutrient availability and distance to the edge were of similar magnitude and were largely mediated by the overstorey and ground vegetation.Conclusions: Land-use legacies and tree encroachment can have differential effects on the species richness of different functional groups. Typical heathland dwarf shrubs were able to withstand moderate levels of increased nutrient availability and tree colonization. However, the combination of these factors poses a serious threat, as dwarf shrub richness decreased due to an increase in the cover of herbaceous species and light limitation.

However, local-scale effects have generally been better considered than large-scale effects that may be pertinent for plant diversity conservation. We examined variation in plant diversity in an agricultural region by comparing patterns observed at large and local scales for different land uses. We tested whether habitat specificity (which relates to how specific different species are to particular land uses) can indicate the importance of land uses to plant diversity conservation.LocationNorthwest Slopes of New South Wales, Australia.MethodsWe surveyed 127 quadrats of grassy vegetation across four land uses: previously cultivated and never-cultivated native pastures, grazed woodland and ungrazed woodlands (grazing refugia). We assessed (1) species density at the quadrat scale, (2) correlations among explanatory variables and species composition using ordination techniques, and (3) habitat specificity at the regional scale using the -diversity contribution index.ResultsAt the quadrat scale, differences in species density among land uses were not pronounced. In contrast, habitat specificity was highest in ungrazed, unfertilized woodlands. Land uses that were grazed, cleared of trees and fertilized were generally species dense at the quadrat scale (>40 species 400m(-2)), but were comprised of a limited suite of native and exotic grasses and forbs, with relatively homogeneous composition across the region.ConclusionsIn the region studied, grazing refugia with no tree clearing or history of fertilizer application were valuable for conserving a large number of native species, and so should be protected. Such land uses are currently rare in the region. Simple measures of native or total species density were insufficient for evaluating conservation value, as they did not distinguish habitats with large numbers of common, generalist native species from those with species that were rare or restricted in the region. Analyses of habitat specificity may potentially overcome the pitfalls of basing conservation management decisions on local-scale measures. Our results also highlighted a need to understand the processes associated with management practices that serve to reduce species diversity at landscape and regional scales."	5	0	0	0	5	0	7	2016-11-23	WOS:000386136600005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Do traits of successful target species differ from those of resident species? How do plant traits relate to environmental constraints? Location In-situ experimental sites on wastelands in shrinking residential areas in Berlin, Germany. Methods We established grassland restoration treatments and explored plant traits of successful and failed target species (plant height, specific leaf area, seed mass, seed shape, seed longevity index, CSR strategy type, plant life form). To shed light on mechanisms that shape restoration success, we also analysed the same traits of species originating from the soil seed bank and species immigrating from the surroundings. We compared both trait sets to those of resident species. With RLQ analyses we related the trait data to abundance data of species and to variables describing the environmental setting of the sites. Results In the third year after treatment, several plant traits differed between the successful or failed target species and the resident vegetation, e.g. successful target species tended to be as tall as resident species, whereas failed target species were smaller, suggesting insufficient competitive ability of the latter. Species that successfully recruited from the soil seed bank were taller than resident species. Small specific leaf area was important for the establishment success of target species. Trait composition of the species assemblage clearly related to the environmental setting: mean specific leaf area and the proportion of annuals increased and the proportion of C-strategists decreased with increasing human-mediated impacts on the restoration sites. Conclusions Our results reveal clear trait differences between successful and failed target species in grassland restoration on urban wasteland sites, demonstrating that high competitive ability is crucial for success in target species. Grassland species that are successfully integrated into urban wasteland vegetation may thus fill well-defined vacant niches, while resembling the traits of the resident species in other ways. Our results may allow generalizations and transfer to similar urban settings, as the analysed trait states were assessed as relative values compared to resident species."	63	0	0	0	56	0	82	2013-04-01	WOS:000315690500012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Methods Twelve dung samples were collected for one calendar year (Jun 2009May 2010) from a free-roaming herd of Konik horses grazing vegetation at Wicken Fen NNR. Germinable seed content of the dung was determined by means of a seedling emergence study. Species presence and estimated cover/abundance were recorded for the grazed (background) vegetation in spring and summer 2009. Results Almost one-third of all species present in the background vegetation were also identified in the dung samples. There was an equal split between graminoids and forbs, but substantially more graminoid germinable seeds. Species were dispersed year-round, with the number of species peaking in Sep and again in Dec. Of the 13 traits measured, there were significant differences between dung and background vegetation for six traits. Mean values for seed release heights (minimum and maximum) and dispersule weight were significantly lower in species found in the dung, whilst dung species had significantly greater numbers of seeds per shoot, inferred Ellenberg nitrogen values and seed bank persistence. Conclusion Year-round free-roaming grazing has the potential to make a considerable contribution to the long-range dispersal of species growing in temperate fen habitats, and is likely to complement alternative dispersal strategies. However, germination and establishment of species post-dispersal fate will be governed by a wide range of environmental conditions."	20	1	0	0	17	0	24	2012-08-01	WOS:000305936800007	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Does the magnitude and the sign of this response depend on the successional status of woody species? Location: A limestone quarry in a semi-arid Mediterranean area in SE Spain. Methods: We studied seedling survival and growth of six woody species with contrasting ecological strategies (early-successional vs late-successional) and their associated herbaceous layer under different irrigation and organic fertilization levels Results: Elevated water supply, but not organic fertilization, increased herbaceous cover. The response of woody seedlings and changes in herbaceous cover to a contrasting resource supply was species-specific. Seedling survival and growth of late-successional species increased at high levels of irrigation. Pioneer species showed the opposite trend, suggesting that increases in water availability may outweigh the deleterious effect of increased herbaceous competition in late-successional species but not in early-successional species. Conclusions: Our study provides further insights into the role of techniques such as irrigation and organic fertilization, which are commonly used in conjunction with hydroseeding, in defining woody plant establishment and successional trajectories in semi-arid areas under restoration. Our results will contribute to improve restoration success by reconciling two major objectives of restoration: soil protection and secondary succession. We recommend a new approach for the restoration of limestone quarries. This approach comprises the planting of late-successional species on randomly distributed nutrient-rich patches of high availability ofwater and nutrients, and the use of pioneer species in the surrounding nutrient poor and drier matrix.

We quantify: (1) the rate at which composition changes from early-successional to late-successional species and functional groups, as indicated by site movement in ordination space over time, and (2) the rate of change in the colonization and local extinction of individual species. We correlate the pace of succession to site area, isolation and surrounding land cover.ResultsSome commonalities in successional trends were evident among sites. Annual species were replaced by clonal perennials, and colonization rates declined over time. However, differences among sites outweighed site age in determining species composition, and the pace of succession was influenced by a site's landscape setting. Rates of species turnover were higher in smaller wetlands. In addition, wetlands in agricultural landscapes underwent succession more rapidly, as indicated by a rapid increase in dominance by late-successional plants.ConclusionsAlthough the outcome of plant community succession in restored wetlands was somewhat predictable, species composition and the pace of succession varied among sites.

However, at the species level, grazing enhanced the abundance of some desired perennial, annual and biennial species, graminoids and bryophytes in both habitat types. The increased frequency of positive indicator species for habitat condition suggests that grazing was beneficial for species of conservation interest. Ellenberg nitrogen (N) values decreased after grazing in dry habitats but showed no long-term change independent of grazing, suggesting no increase in site fertility over the study period.

A survey of vegetation communities was conducted in eighteen upland catchments with differing land use history (manged and Forest Preserve), including overstory, understory, and (lead wood (snags and downed woody debris) using randomly placed plots.Results: Mean overstory density and basal area were not significantly different between land uses, although mean overstory tree size was greater in Preserve catchments. Sapling densities were greater in managed catchments. while mean herb/shrub coverage was not affected by land use. Densities of 25% of common species were affected by land use, determined by GIS coverages constructed using an Inverse Distance Weighted estimation procedure. Discriminant Analysis of per-plot plant community data correctly classified 89% of both managed and Preserve plots.Conclusion: The success of the Discriminant Analysis in classifying land uses based on vegetation communities indicates its potential utility of this method in comparing forest vegetation to a reference condition in this and other areas. The analysis suggests that at least 85 years is required for Adirondack Upland catchments to recover following harvesting.

Dissimilarities were calculated from the original assessment and modelled in a Bayesian framework to examine the influence of logging, number of prescribed burns and time.Results: All sites underwent significant changes over time independently of the imposed management regimes. Logging resulted in an immediate change in vegetation assemblage which decreased in the subsequent assessments. The number of prescribed fires brought greater change in the shrub vegetation assemblages, but less change in the ground species vegetation assemblages.Conclusions: The anthropogenic disturbances did have some role in the changes of vegetation assemblages but these were minimal.

Under P-poor conditions, the brown moss stage is stabilized as long as mineral-rich water is supplied. This is because S. scorpioides is tolerant of rainwater, is a strong competitor and can counteract acidification to some extent while S. sulmitens is intolerant to groundwater and has low growth rates and low acidification capacity. In contrast, the Sphagnum stage is stable after rapid succession from rich-fen mosses under P-rich conditions. Calliergonella cuspidata has suboptimal growth in rainwater, possibly due to ammonium toxicity, while the high growth rates of S. squarrosum in nutrient-rich and highly acidic groundwater allow early establishment and rapid expansion.Conclusions: If measures to improve fen base status occur in environments of increased nutrient (P) availability, the management may not lead to the desired restoration of brown moss stages, but instead to rapid acidification by S. squarrosum."	37	0	0	0	33	0	37	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600006	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Seeds and seedlings of Arnica montana were put out in the treated plots to test the suitability of the restored soil conditions. In addition, seed banks of both degraded areas were studied.Results: Germination, growth and survival of Arnica montana were significantly greater after sod cutting and liming compared to sod cutting alone. At the end of the four-year study period, the number of endangered wet heath species was significantly greater in the sod-cut plots than in the untreated vegetation. Acid-tolerant species were especially positively affected. Additional liming only slightly increased the total number of species over the two-year study period and the number of endangered species did not increase. Viable seeds of most of the endangered species were absent in the seed banks of both areas.Conclusions: Sod cutting is sufficient for the return of acid-tolerant, endangered wet heath species of early successional stages, because their seeds are still present in the seed bank. In contrast, acid-sensitive species likely depend on combined sod cutting and liming, as they need the weakly buffered soil conditions created by these restoration measures.

Our study focuses on a range-expanding neonative annual plant, Xeranthemum cylindraceum (Asteraceae, tribe Cardueae), which has become common in pastures. We aimed to assess the potential impact of this species on recipient grassland communities in the new range and to compare its performance between the native and neonative range. Location Grasslands in Romania (neonative range) and Bulgaria (native range). Methods We surveyed plots from very low to very high abundances of the target species in grassland stands. To compare the vegetation between cover categories of X. cylindraceum and between the two study regions, we calculated species richness, Shannon diversity and community weighted mean of Ellenberg and disturbance indicator values. We also compared the vegetation composition based on species life span, habitat preference and guild. Results Our results show that species richness and diversity do not decrease with the increasing abundance of X. cylindraceum in recipient grasslands. However, the cover of specialist and long-lived species was lower, while that of ruderal and short-lived species was higher in vegetation patches with medium to high X. cylindraceum abundance. In the neonative range, this pattern overlapped with an increased disturbance severity and soil nitrogen content indicated by community composition, which bears clear signs of grazing disturbance forcefully transforming plant composition and causing ruderalisation. Conclusions We conclude that the range-expanding X. cylindraceum does not raise conservation problems, since it is not impacting recipient grassland communities in its neonative range. However, it appears to benefit from grazing disturbance. As a toxic, unpalatable species, it decreases the economic value of intensively used grasslands, pointing out the need for decreasing stocking rates in intensively used pastures."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-10-14	WOS:001589308300001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In regions where deer impact is particularly severe, fencing is sometimes employed as a conservation measure to safeguard rare and threatened species and ecosystems. Here we examine how forest vascular plant communities have been affected by 21 years of sika deer exclusion by fencing of a 900 ha area.LocationNikko National Park, Tochigi prefecture, Japan.MethodsWe surveyed vascular plant cover in 240 plots and measured forest density on both sides of the fence in stands dominated by larch (Larix kaempferi) and oak (Quercus crispula).ResultsVascular plant species richness was found to be lower in forest areas protected by the fence. At the same time, dwarf bamboo, often the most abundant understory component in Japanese open forests, was taller and denser inside the fence where deer had been excluded. In addition, the lack of natural tree regeneration inside the fence, likely due to strong dwarf bamboo competition, was also notable. This suggests that deer exclusion has benefitted dwarf bamboo while inhibiting the competition of other species, thereby lowering vascular plant richness. Vascular plant communities outside the fence instead seem to be strongly shaped by abundant sika deer; several species found there are known to be unpalatable or grazing tolerant, and there were few tree seedlings.ConclusionThese results show that fencing to protect forest flora against overgrazing may have unintended consequences where there is a risk that competitive species can dominate understory plant communities. Instead of fencing, improved game management to maintain moderate deer populations may be a better strategy for large-scale conservation of forest flora and for promoting natural tree regeneration."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-03-21	WOS:001444485900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Unfortunately, misconceptions about fire frequently guide policies, threating fire-prone ecosystems whose persistence depends on such disturbance. In this paper, we highlight the importance of fire, both current and in recent history, in grassy-pine ecosystems of Mexico and clarify why it is important to understand the role of fire in such ecosystems. We also consider evidence on current fire regimes and management practices, and how they may be impacting different grassy-pine ecosystems. Results We propose a classification of pine ecosystems that acknowledges their huge differences in terms of climate, structure, and composition. Three of these communities have frequently open canopies with grassy understories: pinon woodlands, tropical savannas (Pinus oocarpa savannas) and subalpine woodlands. The majority of the grassy-pine communities are pinon woodlands, mostly in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental. Tropical savannas represent a small proportion of the total, distributed in the plains near the Pacific coast. Subalpine woodlands have the smallest area. Conclusions The lack of recognition in Mexico of the diversity of pine-dominated ecosystems as different types of vegetation with contrasting characteristics and dynamics has resulted in fragmentary information on their natural fire regimes. Evidence suggests that frequent fires may have shaped Mexican grassy-pine ecosystems. Nevertheless, evidence for pinon woodlands is still inconclusive and there may be a large variability in the natural fire regime between sites. Satellite data suggest that current fire frequency in grassy-pine ecosystems is lower than the natural one, and that it increased in recent years just as the budgets for fighting fires diminished in the country. It thus seems that misguided fire suppression policies have strongly altered natural fire regimes."	2	0	0	0	2	0	2	2022-10-28	WOS:000870325200001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Most predictive models of community responses to climate change ignore individual-level biotic interactions despite their known importance for community diversity and functioning. Here, we consider plant fitness and diversity responses to climate change associated factors at three organisational levels: communities, populations and individual plants, to increase our understanding of how plant communities respond to climate change.Location Montane grassland, Tasmania, Australia.Methods In two plant communities, we manipulated temperature using open-top chambers and removed random and dominant species biomass. Two years after experimental manipulations, we assessed the impact of treatments on species diversity, community- and population-level functional traits and individual plant fitness.Results Species diversity was affected by warming in one of the two communities, while community-level functional trait diversity metrics were unaffected by treatments. Mean community trait values were strongly impacted by dominant species biomass removal in both communities, notably increasing specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length. SLA showed the strongest population-level trait response, with higher values found in warmed plots and lower values found in dominant species biomass removal plots. Neighbours had a stronger competitive effect on individual plant fitness in warmed compared to unwarmed conditions at the higher-elevation site and facilitation was common in both communities.Conclusions We demonstrated that over short time scales, plant communities respond to experimental warming and biomass removal across multiple organisational levels. Competitive and facilitative interactions played a significant role in determining fitness outcomes, but competitive interactions dominated under warmed conditions. We highlight the importance of local-scale biotic interactions in mediating individual responses to warming and recommend their inclusion in future studies of how climate change will impact the long-term structure and function of plant communities through short-term impacts on individual plant fitness."	10	1	0	0	8	0	10	2021-03-17	WOS:000624276400001	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The foliage of the main canopy tree of a mountain evergreen oak forest was harvested at different intensities prior to a forest survey in 1993 and resampled in 2013 after the harvest of canopy foliage ceased (1995). We predict a decrease in herbaceous species richness with increasing canopy cover, and an opposite trend for vines and woody species. We hypothesise that plant species' alpha and beta diversity will change most in the plots where foliage was most intensively harvested while showing less change in the plots that underwent almost no harvesting.Location Temperate evergreen laurel-oak forest in the Himalaya, Nepal.Methods We resampled all non-epiphytic vascular plants in 64 plots of 10 m x 10 m in 2013, following the same protocol used in 1993. Plant species were categorised into three life forms; woody (except woody vines), herbaceous, and vines. Uni- and multivariate numerical methods were used to assess the significance of the changes in species diversity for different life forms.Results Vines and woody species increased, whereas herbaceous species decreased, but overall gamma diversity remained unchanged. The overall alpha richness for herbaceous species decreased, while the opposite is true for woody and vine richness. Herbaceous richness decreased and woody richness increased in the areas with low and intermediate disturbance (in 1993), whereas vines remained unchanged. Only vine richness increased in the area that was very disturbed in 1993. Total species richness as well as herbaceous and vine richness decreased with increasing tree canopy cover.Conclusions Plots that were intensively harvested in 1993 did not recover their richness because vines dominated the forest floor.

We analysed how tree recruitment varies in space and between species.Location Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Island of Hawai'i.Methods All woody plants with diameter at breast height >= 5 cm were surveyed twice at approx. 17- to 18-year intervals in 200 circular plots (15-m radius) located in two sites. We used generalized linear mixed models to analyse how the number of recruits of wind- and bird-dispersed species per plot varied between plots as a function of the number and sizes of remaining trees, grass cover, distance to the forest-grassland edge, and the identity of sites. Within plots, for each species we analysed the density distribution of recruits as a function of a neighbourhood crowding index and grass cover. Observed distributions were compared to null distributions.Results About 4,000 recruits representing seven species were inventoried. Wind-dispersed species tended to recruit randomly, including in open, grassy areas. The number of bird-dispersed recruits was negatively associated with grass cover and positively associated with basal area of remaining trees. Bird-dispersed species recruited more in areas with an intermediate neighbourhood crowding index. The number of recruits was strongly correlated with the number of remaining trees for each species. One species, Cheirodendron trigynum (Araliaceae), recruited twice as much as expected given the number of remnant trees.Conclusions The high levels of recruitment of all species were likely due to cattle removal as well as pig population control. Competition with grasses constitutes the main limiting factor for tree recruitment following removal of ungulates. Remnant Metrosideros polymorpha likely create favourable conditions for the recruitment of bird-dispersed species. Higher seed production and growth rates likely allowed Cheirodendron trigynum to recruit much more than the other species."	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2020-04-13	WOS:000522603200006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Soil seed banks could play an important role in restoring vegetation that was originally present, by recruiting species that have disappeared above-ground. We addressed this topic in plantations located in the Patagonian steppe by asking the following questions: Are richness, abundance and composition of steppe above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank affected by plantations? Is species composition of the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank similar in plantations and in the steppe?Location NW of Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina.Methods We selected three plantations located in the steppe, and delimited three sectors: steppe, plantation edge and plantation interior. We compared richness and abundance by species origin and growth form among sectors for the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank compartments, using generalized linear mixed models. We compared species composition for each compartment and between them using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and non-metric multidimensional scaling.Results In above-ground vegetation, we found a decrease in richness and abundance, and changes in composition from the steppe to the plantation interior. Richness and abundance of the soil seed bank did not show differences among steppe and the plantation sectors, although composition was different among them. Above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank species composition were always different; native perennial herbs and shrubs were predominant in the above-ground vegetation while exotic annual herbs dominated the soil seed bank.Conclusions Our findings suggest that plant recruitment from the soil seed bank would not be sufficient for restoring depleted species pools in the above-ground vegetation of plantations. Therefore, actions promoting native species reestablishment and control of exotics should be considered to reach the aim of restoring biodiversity in former plantations."	13	0	0	0	11	0	13	2020-03-04	WOS:000514614400001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The species composition of vernal pool plant communities was influenced by both livestock grazing and precipitation patterns, however the relative effects of these environmental variables differed by functional group. Livestock exclosures favoured perennial vernal pool specialists over annual vernal pool specialists. In contrast, the cover of habitat generalists was more strongly influenced by seasonal precipitation than livestock grazing. At small spatial scales, species richness and diversity decreased as the number of years a pool had been fenced increased, but this relationship was not significant at a larger spatial scale.Conclusions: Both livestock grazing and seasonal precipitation structure the montane vernal pool plant community.

We used a hierarchical GLMM to simultaneously model the presence or absence (i.e. probability of occurrence) of all plant species as a function of their attributes (growth form, lifespan and origin) to assess their average response to recent grazing, historic grazing and productivity in a broad-scale regional study.ResultsRecent and historic livestock grazing, rabbit grazing and increasing NPP reduced the average probability of occurrence of plant species, although responses varied among plant attributes. Both recent and historic livestock grazing strongly reduced the average probability of occurrence of native species, and forbs and geophytes, but differed in their relative effects on other growth forms. Recent livestock grazing, rabbit grazing and NPP had similar effects, strongly reducing native species and forbs, geophytes, shrubs and sub-shrubs. The overall effects of recent kangaroo grazing were relatively weak, with no clear trends for any given plant attribute.ConclusionOur results highlight the complex nature of grazing by introduced herbivores compared with native herbivores on different plant attributes.

This study asks if increased geomorphic complexity increases recruitment conditions of sown seeds or affects post-dispersal natural seedling densities.LocationVindel River catchment, northern Sweden.MethodsWe selected seven study streams with paired reaches that differed in the degree to which geomorphic complexity was restored. Basic reaches used simple restoration methods while enhanced reaches additionally added large boulders and woody debris. We sowed seeds of six species at ten locations in each reach in 2014 and counted the number of seedlings after 8wk and the number of naturally occurring seedlings in a plot adjacent to the sowing locations in 2013 and 2014. Using factor analysis based on 34 complexity measurements, overall geomorphic complexity was quantified for eight of the 14 reaches.ResultsTotal numbers of sown (2014) and natural seedlings (2013 and 2014) summed per reach did not differ between restoration types when tested pair-wise. Enhanced restoration did not always significantly increase geomorphic complexity, which differed considerably between the streams. More complex reaches were steeper, had larger size sediment and more nutrient-poor soils. Total recruitment of sown species significantly decreased with increasing complexity. Numbers of natural seedlings differed considerably from 2013 to 2014, but were not related to complexity. In 2014, a potential parent plant of the same species occurred within the same plot for 71.8% of the natural seedlings that could be identified.ConclusionsThe recruitment of sown seeds was affected by overall geomorphic complexity rather than by the enhanced restoration. The absence of a correlation between geomorphic complexity and natural seedlings could indicate that natural seedling dynamics are not solely determined by recruitment conditions, but also by dispersal."	5	0	0	0	5	0	7	2017-07-04	WOS:000403676000012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do components interact in their effect on vegetation?LocationSan Jose department, Southern Campos, Uruguay.MethodsIn a manipulative field experiment we simulated three different grazing components: trampling, defoliation and urine deposition, over 3yr in a natural grassland. Defoliation was analysed through two intensity levels and two procedures: uniform and selective cutting. We evaluated the effects of grazing components on species diversity and composition, and frequency of plant functional types.ResultsAll simulated grazing components had at least some effect on vegetation structure. Additionally, both individual and interactive effects on vegetation attributes were detected. Our study indicates that the relative influence of each grazing component varied according to the attribute considered. N addition was the only treatment that affected plant diversity. Plant functional type composition, in turn, was affected mainly by trampling. N addition and trampling were the component that affected the frequency of the largest number of species. Defoliation selectivity showed effects both in terms of plant functional type and species composition. Exclosure treatment and defoliation intensity had slight effects on grassland structure.ConclusionsThis study provides insight on the underlying mechanisms of some observed patterns of grazing on the Campos grasslands. Our results lead us to conclude that all grazing components have to be taken into account to understand vegetation dynamics subjected to grazing. Prevention of woody encroachment by grazing can be attributed to direct and indirect effects of trampling. Trampling should be taken into account to explain increaser species responses. However, mechanisms responsible for other general patterns remain less clear. The importance of selective defoliation in species replacement induced by grazing in these grasslands has yet to be clarified."	64	4	0	0	54	2	71	2016-10-01	WOS:000386136600003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, tree recruitment is frequently hampered in deforested lands. Tree seed dispersal is scarce and spatially constrained, confining the potential of forest regeneration to a narrow band surrounding forest remnants. Understanding how landscape configuration can favour endozoochorous seed dispersal into deforested lands is thus crucial to recover forest extent and the concomitant ecosystem services. Can distance restrictions on seed dispersal be modified as a result of temporal variability of fruit-frugivore systems?Location: Deforested montane pastures surrounding fragments of secondary temperate forest, Cantabrian Range, Spain.Methods: For 2 yr, we evaluated the patterns of fruit production, frugivorous bird movement and tree seed dispersal through the landscape. Seed dispersal in deforested sampling stations was related to their distance to forest cover and the amount of forest cover in their surroundings.Results: The large-scale spatial distribution of fruits varied strongly between years, with relatively higher fruit production in isolated trees within pastures in the second year, when birds were more frequently observed perching on isolated trees. In both years, few seeds were dispersed into deforested areas, and those dispersed occurred close to forest cover. Nevertheless, seed arrival at longer distances increased during the second year. When more fruits were produced within the pastures, birds more often overcame their reluctance to leave the forest, and this change in frugivore foraging patterns cascaded into the spatial patterns of seed dispersal.Conclusions: By influencing frugivore activity, temporal dynamism in fruiting landscapes can relax the restriction on tree seed dispersal into deforested areas. Landscape biological dynamism should be taken into account in order to manage rewilding in European temperate forests."	11	0	0	0	11	0	11	2015-04-01	WOS:000352131500005	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Thus far, good predictors of whether grazing will have positive effects on plant species richness are limited. How does the interplay between low-intensity grazing and topographic heterogeneity affect plant species richness at different spatial scales?LocationLong-term grazed and ungrazed salt marshes of the Dutch Wadden Sea island of Schiermonnikoog.MethodsWe selected ten plots of 2200m(2) in grazed and ungrazed areas of our study sites, and recorded and compared plant species richness in 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000m(2) subplots. Topographic heterogeneity was quantified at the plot scale using the standard deviation of the elevation derived from a high-resolution (5mx5m) digital elevation model. We calculated species-area relationships to analyse our data.ResultsWe found that large-scale topographic heterogeneity (based on the whole plot of 2200m(2)) positively affects plant species richness at all scales (even at the smallest 0.1-m(2) scale), and that grazing has a positive additive effect at the small scales (0.1 and 10m(2)). While grazing also had a positive effect on species richness at larger scales (1000m(2)), the strength of the effect was dependent on the topographic heterogeneity at that scale. The effectiveness of grazing for increased plant species richness was highest at low topographic heterogeneity, and lowest at intermediate topographic heterogeneity. Effects of intermediate heterogeneity were probably counterbalanced by the effects of grazing.ConclusionsOur results suggest that the variation in elevation is an important predictor of whether low-intensity grazing has positive effects on plant species richness or not. Grazing appears most beneficial at low topographic heterogeneity, but whether these findings hold for other grazed ecosystems will depend on several factors, most importantly, the relationship between topographic and abiotic heterogeneity. Results of our study are highly relevant for the application of low-intensity grazing as tool for conservation management in salt marshes and other natural areas."	10	6	0	0	10	0	17	2014-10-01	WOS:000342839200003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Uncertainty exists over whether the present unpalatable shrubland state might have replaced a historical grassland state. Settled agriculture characterized by fixed burning cycles and overgrazing by livestock has been blamed for this putative change. However, the disappearance of native large herbivores has also been implicated. Understanding the drivers responsible for putative state changes is of importance for conservation of this critically endangered vegetation type.Location: Renosterveld shrublands and grasslands of the De Hoop Nature Reserve, Western Cape Province, South Africa.Methods: Three structural states of renosterveld (grazing lawn, tussock grassland and shrubland) were subjected to an experiment involving fire (burned/unburned) and herbivory (grazed/ungrazed by native mesoherbivores). Using animal exclosures and experimental burning, we measured the responses of the biomass of major plant functional types over 6 yrs to test whether switches between states occur in order to discern the drivers of these changes. The data were analysed using permutational MANOVA, Fisher's exact contingency tests and NMDS.Results: Herbivory (but not fire) had significant effects on lawn and tussock grassland biomass. Palatable shrubs proliferated in tussock grassland protected from herbivory. Unpalatable shrubs invaded burned lawn habitats exposed to herbivory. The vegetation composition of the shrubland state was affected by fire, herbivory and by the interaction between the two. Burned and grazed shrubland reverted to a dense canopy unpalatable state, while shrubland plots protected from grazing became palatable shrubland with a grass understorey. Palatable shrub species increased in the unburned and ungrazed shrubland plots, while the biomass of unpalatable shrubs declined in both the unburned grazed and exclosure plots.Conclusion: We found no evidence supporting the hypothesis that the disappearance of native large herbivores led to the conversion of tussock grassland into unpalatable shrubland. Instead, the removal of native browsers caused palatable shrubs to dominate tussock grassland areas. Unpalatable shrubland is retained through a combination of fire and herbivory, but how this state established and persisted historically remains undetermined. Temporary relief from large herbivore grazing after unpalatable shrubland has been burned is recommended if a more open grassland state is the desired target."	25	0	0	0	21	2	27	2014-07-01	WOS:000337725300009	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Four blocks, each with three 50mx 40m plots, were established. One plot per block was burned during the early season (ES) and one during the late season (LS), and the third remained unburned. Prior to, and during the first 4yrs after burning, each burned plot was sampled for species abundance, vigour and richness. The effects of fire through time were tested using random blocks repeated measures ANOVA. Recruitment was modelled as a function of percentage of post-fire soil covered by litter (%). MANOVA was used to test changes in the relative dominance of the woody species due to fire. Community dynamics were assessed by NMDS ordination analysis.ResultsFire severity was higher and the percentage of post-fire soil covered by litter lower in ES than LS burns. The post-fire plant dynamics were dominated by the resprouting response. Resprouting was not affected by burning season, but ES fires resulted in higher seedling recruitment than LS fires, particularly in the dominant seeder E.umbellata. Seedling recruitment was negatively related to post-fire soil covered by litter. Additionally, seedling emergence was delayed by nearly 1yr in LS fires with respect to ES fires. Species richness was higher in ES than LS fires. Fire did not globally affect the relative abundance of the dominant species, although the seeder E.umbellata decreased its relative cover with respect to the other dominant species. Ordination analysis showed that the post-fire dynamics of the vegetation were on a track of convergence with the community existing before fire.ConclusionBurning season differentially affected regeneration, mainly by its effect on seeding, with little effect on resprouting. Burning season and associated changes in fire severity and soil covered by litter could alter the short-term regeneration dynamics, which can have important implications for managing this highly flammable vegetation."	24	0	0	0	22	0	25	2014-01-01	WOS:000328544400010	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Option (3) would be the cheapest in regions where large vegetation-plot databases are available, but there is a risk of incorrect results due to a spatial mismatch of old and new plots. Here we assess the accuracy of such analyses.MethodsWe used three data sets of permanent plots from Czech mountain bogs and Dutch oak forests and heathlands to quantify vegetation change. We selected subsets to simulate analyses based on (1) data from permanent plots or revisited phytosociological plots, i.e. containing old and new records from the same plots, (2) vegetation-plot databases with old and new records from different, randomly selected sites, and (3) vegetation-plot databases with old and new records from different but close sites. We repeated each subset selection 1000 times and analysed vegetation change in each of the three data sets and each variant of subset selection using permutational multivariate analysis of variance.ResultsFor data sets with no actual vegetation change, analyses of some subsets simulating vegetation-plot databases incorrectly suggested significant changes. For a data set with real change, a change was detected in analyses of simulated vegetation-plot databases, but in several cases it had a different direction or magnitude to the real change.ConclusionsThe assessment of vegetation change using vegetation-plot databases should be either avoided or interpreted with extreme caution because of the risk of incorrect results. Analyses such as these may be used to propose hypotheses about past vegetation change, but their results should not be considered valid unless confirmed using more reliable data. In many contexts, re-visitation studies of historical phytosociological plots may be the best strategy to assess past vegetation change, while new networks of carefully stratified permanent plots are preferable for monitoring future change."	93	2	0	0	82	0	98	2014-01-01	WOS:000328544400005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Although habitat restoration can reverse this process, it is often limited in scope by socioeconomic constraints. Here we present a grassland restoration project that is exceptional in spatial scale in Europe.Location: A total area of 760 ha of arable land was restored in the Egyek-Pusztakocs unit (50 km(2)) of Hortobagy National Park, east Hungary, between 2005 and 2008.Methods: Restoration targeted alkali steppes and loess grasslands by sowing seeds of either two (alkali) or three (loess) foundation grass species. In 2009, we surveyed the vegetation in restored and target grasslands and quantified the factors influencing restoration success in a space-for-time substitution design.Results: We recorded 100 species of flowering plants, of which 37 species were non-weed, 'target' species. Annual weeds dominated 1-yr-old fields but had decreased dramatically by the third year due to a developing perennial grass cover. Former alfalfa fields had proportionally fewer weeds than former cereal and sunflower fields. The diversity of common species and the cover of target species increased from 1- to 4-yr-old restored fields. Alkali-restored fields had more heterogeneous vegetation and more species than loess-restored fields. Distance to the target vegetation did not directly affect vegetation variables. There was significant spatial variability in vegetation development, possibly suggesting several local pathways of succession.Conclusions: Grassland restoration was generally successful in accelerating secondary succession towards alkali steppes and loess grasslands. However, further management is necessary to counter the homogenizing effects of litter accumulation, to reduce perennial weeds and to enhance the colonization of target species. Our project provides useful practical insights into grassland restoration and in applying restoration at a number of sites within a larger area to conserve biodiversity at the landscape scale."	43	3	0	0	41	0	52	2012-03-28	WOS:000301047300011	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The mines, which had been restored using two restoration methods (topsoil addition or not), comprised a chronosequence of different ages from 1 to 40 yr since restoration started. Soil and environmental factors at each mine were monitored and related to species cover using a combination of ordination methods and Huisman-Olff-Fresco modeling.ResultsPlant succession was affected by restoration method . Where topsoil was added, succession was influenced by age since restoration and soil pH. Where no topsoil was added, soil factors seem to arrest succession. Vegetation composition on topsoiled sites showed a gradient with age, from the youngest, with early colonizing species, to oldest, with an increase in woody species. Vegetation on non-topsoiled sites comprised mainly early-successional species. Response to age and pH of 37 species found on topsoiled mines is described.ConclusionsRestoration of coal mines under this Mediterranean climate can be relatively fast if topsoil is added, with a native shrub community developing after 15 yr. However, if topsoil is not used, it takes more than 40 yr. For topsoiled mines, the species found in the different successional stages were identified, and their tolerance to soil pH was derived.

Trees were recorded by size and species on twenty 20 m x 20 m plots; percent cover was estimated for each herb species in nested 10 m x 10 m plots. Environmental characteristics were noted, and soil samples analysed for nutrient availability and organic matter. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination was performed separately on both tree and herb datasets to graphically characterize community composition among plots. Life-history traits were investigated to explain observed compositional differences.ResultsVegetation patterns were explained by current environmental gradients, especially by land-use history. Cultivated and pasture sites had similar tree composition, distinct from reference sites. Herb composition of pasture and reference sites was similar and distinct from cultivated sites, suggesting the 'tenacity' of some forest herbs on formerly cleared sites. Tilling removes rhizomatous species, and disfavors species with unassisted dispersal. These life-history traits were underrepresented on cultivated sites, although ant-dispersed species were not.ConclusionsHistoric land-use practices accounted for as much variation in species composition as environmental gradients.

Is this difference in vegetation due to lack of dispersal or unsuitable abiotic conditions ? What could be done for a better restoration of the site?Location: Northwestern France.Methods: Seeds were trapped at the single inlet of the polder with a 200-mu m mesh net to estimate inputs of seeds from the bay. In parallel, seed dispersal was studied in the polder by placing Astroturf(R) seed traps on the surface of the sediment at three different elevations in three distinct areas. Abiotic conditions such as flooding frequency, water table level and soil salinity were monitored.Results: All but one species from the adjacent salt marshes were trapped at the inlet. Not all of these species were on the seed traps inside the polder. Seed dispersal was not homogeneous in the polder and seed trap content mostly discriminated in function of their elevation. Salinity and water logging at the bottom of the slope were very high compared to tolerance of most halophytes but decreased rapidly higher up the slope.Conclusions: The development of salt marsh target species is highly restricted by limited hydrochory inside the polder but also by unfavourable soil conditions induced by the actual hydrological regime. Halophytes are excluded at the bottom of the slope by abiotic conditions and out-competed by sub-halophytes higher up. In order to restore salt marsh vegetation inside the polder, a larger opening should be induced in order to increase the flooded surface, and diminish water logging and flooding frequencies."	21	1	0	0	18	0	27	2008-02-01	WOS:000252958300002	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The percentage cover of all vascular plant species was recorded in 40 permanent plots.Results: Total plant species richness increased in all managed treatments, whereas species number was reduced in U at the end of the experiment. Tall forbs (Aegopodium podagraria, Galium album, Anthriscus sylvestris, Cirsium arvense) as well as tall grasses (Elytrigia repens and Alopecurus pratensis) were more abundant in U.

Dispersal by water, animals and wind has been hampered by changes related to development in landscapes surrounding fens. Because the seeds of certain species are long-lived in the seed bank, frequent episodes of dispersal are not always necessary to maintain the biodiversity of fens. However, of particular concern to restoration is that some dominant species, such as the tussock sedge Carex stricta, may not disperse readily between fens.Conclusions: Knowledge of seed dispersal can be used to maintain and restore the biodiversity of fens in fragmented landscapes. Given that development has fragmented landscapes and that this situation is not likely to change, the dispersal of seeds might be enhanced by moving hay or cattle from fens to damaged sites, or by reestablishing lost hydrological connections."	35	2	0	0	34	0	45	2006-11-01	WOS:000244052600014	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In this four-year study, plants were grown in monoculture or in combination with the unpalatable Hilaria in a replacement design.Under no defoliation, the unpalatable Hilaria had a lower growth potential than Bouteloua curtipendula and Nassella leucotricha that were of equal stature, and produced only as much as the shorter grass, Buchloe dactyloides. Bouteloua had the highest growth potential under no-defoliation and was defoliation tolerant, except when defoliated at ground level. Nassella was more productive than the unpalatable Hilaria, since the ability to grow earlier in the year enabled it to compete successfully with Hilaria. These results indicate that with adequate deferment Bouteloua and Nassella should compete successfully with Hilaria and Buchloe should be able to maintain itself in the presence of Hilaria.Under non-selective defoliation, Hilaria was able to compete successfully only with Buchloe. Hilaria was sensitive to defoliation, despite being rhizomatous, and competed less successfully with Buchloe after non-selective defoliation than it did when not defoliated. This indicates that the management practice of burning and stocking heavily with livestock until Hilaria is avoided, resulting in non-selective defoliation, will not cause Hilaria to be more competitive with the more palatable Bouteloua, Buchloe or Nassella.Hilaria was able to compete most successfully under selective defoliation when it was not defoliated. Under selective defoliation, by avoiding herbivory, Hilaria is able to compete strongly with,it least Buchloe and Nassella. The reaction of Nassella and Buchloe to selective defoliation indicates that they may have been displaced by Hilaria in the past. In contrast, under the short-term and non-limiting growth conditions of this study, Bouteloua competed successfully with Hilaria even under selective defoliation. These results do not rule out the possibility that, through selective defoliation, Hilaria may have displaced other grasses including Bouteloua in the past."	6	0	0	0	3	0	7	2001-12-01	WOS:000174291000012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

A primary management question is whether active intervention is required or spontaneous secondary succession could suffice. We studied 54 old-fields in central Hungary, which differed in time since abandonment but which had similar environmental conditions and management histories. The sites were grouped into four age groups according to the time elapsed since cultivation abandonment: 1-5, 6-10, 11-23 and 24-33 yr. In each old-field we recorded the species and estimated their abundances. We grouped species in two ways: according to life form (annuals, biennials, perennials, woody plants) and according to coenological behaviour (weeds, sand and steppe generalists, specialists). We analysed the changes in species number and abundance in these categories as a function of site age. Contrary to other successional studies, the total number of species did not change significantly among the four age groups. A significant change was detected between the first two age groups as to life-form composition. Species number and abundance of annuals decreased, while the perennials and woody plants increased. As to coenological behaviour, species number changed only in the first two age groups, while abundance changed in the first three. Weeds quickly disappeared and specialists established and spread, while the species number and abundance of generalists did not change significantly. We concluded that the basic shifts in species composition are almost completed within 10 yr. Most of the late successional species colonized and weeds disappeared. We conclude that there was no need for active intervention in this system: the spontaneous secondary succession leads to semi-natural vegetation."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2001-06-01	BCI:BCI200100454346	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In principle, the restoration of damaged raised bogs has rather few requirements: (1) a sufficient supply, and retention, of precipitation water of appropriate quality; and (2) the availability of a suitable range of recolonist species. However, to meet these requirements it may be necessary to engineer the topography of the peatland and drainage systems and to adopt a policy of species introduction. This paper provides a critical summary review of: (1) existing knowledge about the environmental conditions necessary for the effective regeneration of damaged ombrogenous peatlands; (2) approaches adopted for generating conditions appropriate for the re-establishment of plant species typical of raised bogs; (3) possible external constraints (especially atmospheric contaminants) upon the feasibility of restoration; and (4) the prospects and possibilities for effective species recolonization. Particular attention is given to the identification of uncertainties and critical gaps in existing knowledge about raised bog restoration and of some of the natural processes that help regulate the development of raised bogs."	31	1	0	0	19	0	36	1999-05-01	WOS:000208472000013	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This study aimed to elucidate the post-fire succession of black-water floodplain forests (termed igap & oacute; in Brazil) during a 36-year chronosequence, analyzing changes in density, diversity, composition, and aboveground wood biomass (AGWB) of tree species. Furthermore, we also discuss the implications of forest fires on the resilience of igap & oacute; forests. Location: Black-water floodplain forests of the Jau National Park and adjacent regions, Central Amazonia, Brazil. Methods: Floristic inventories of tree species with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm were compiled in 47 plots (625 m(2); total area of 2.94 ha) considering a chronosequence which integrated successional stages of nine distinct fire occurrences associated with El Ni & ntilde;o episodes during the period 1982-2017. AGWB estimates were derived from measurements of diameter, wood density, and tree height, applying a pantropical allometric model. Changes in density, diversity, species composition, and AGWB were analyzed based on the occurrence of fires, and physicochemical soil characteristics (0-20 cm depth), obtained from each plot. Results: A total of 3880 individuals comprising 77 tree species from 29 botanical families were recorded. The dominant families were Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae, Malpighiaceae, Phyllanthaceae, and Lecythidaceae. Time since fire occurrence explained much of the gradual increase in species richness, diversity, density, AGWB stocks, and changes in floristic composition, while soil conditions played a minor role. Conclusions: Black-water floodplain forests need long periods to recover after a single fire disturbance. Even after 36 years, regenerating forests exhibit lower species diversity and AGWB stocks than late-successional stages (> 100 years) of igap & oacute; forests. This reinforces the need to enhance conservation efforts to prevent fires in this vulnerable ecosystem."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-09-16	WOS:001566994100001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We asked how disturbance by rock climbing alters patterns of cryptogam species diversity and composition along elevational abiotic gradients. Location Red River Gorge, Kentucky, United States of America. Methods Surveying was completed within 19 climbing routes on sandstone slabs. Quadrats were placed at three different vertical positions (elevations) and three different horizontal positions (center of the route, route margin, off-route). The former provides a gradient of light and moisture availability while the latter corresponds to climbing impact. Cryptogam species cover was visually assessed in all quadrats. Quadrat microtopography was quantified as well as route-level Heat Load Index and Climbing Use Intensity. We assessed differences in species richness and Shannon diversity (H) among quadrat positions and evaluated differences in species and cryptogam morphological type abundance and composition. Results Significant differences existed in richness H, and total cryptogam abundance between quadrat vertical and horizontal positions with a significant interaction between these two factors. Cryptogram abundance was greatest in off-route quadrats and increased with elevation in such settings. Abundance was consistently lower in on-route quadrats and, here, did not change with elevation. Richness and H were greatest in off-route quadrats and declined with increasing elevation in on-route quadrats. Significant differences in community composition existed as a function of vertical and horizontal position. On-route quadrats were associated with crustose and granulose species, while foliose and squamulose lichens, and bryophytes were associated with off-route quadrats. Conclusions Cryptogam composition and abundance were associated with varying intra-route environmental conditions, and off- to on-route disturbance gradients. There is potential for substantive impacts on the ecology of cliff face ecosystems from climbing. Impacts could be reduced by spacing routes widely and avoiding impacts on upper elevations where diversity and abundance are greatest."	3	0	0	0	2	0	4	2022-09-20	WOS:000853934000001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In this study we seek to answer the following questions: (a) how do initial plant diversity, composition and spatial distribution of the understorey vegetation change in response to different levels of fire severity; and (b) does the abundance of dominant tree species exhibit different patterns across a fire severity gradient shortly after fire?Location Old-growth Araucaria araucana-Nothofagus pumilio forests in the Andes of south-central Chile (38 degrees S, 71 degrees W) burned in 2015.Methods We evaluated the post-fire plant regeneration across a fire severity gradient ranging from unburned forests to areas of high fire severity. One year after fire (in February 2016), we measured woody and herbaceous species richness, abundance, height, origin (native vs exotic species), life forms and the spatial pattern of plant recovery.Results Plant species richness and abundance were significantly higher within the unburned forest and low fire severity areas one year after fire, compared to areas of high and moderate fire severity. Overall, nearly 50% of the species present in the unburned forest were not found in areas of high severity, including the tree Nothofagus pumilio. Rapid vegetative resprouting of pioneer species such as Chusquea culeou resulted in an aggregated spatial distribution of plants after fire.Conclusions Plant diversity and the abundance of Araucaria araucana and Nothofagus pumilio were reduced in areas of high fire severity one year after fire. Exotic species were more abundant within areas of low severity, being likely mediated by cattle browsing. Our research makes clear the potential changes in forest composition and structure if dominant tree species are not capable of recovering after fire. We recommend the exclusion of cattle within fire-affected areas and planting Nothofagus pumilio in areas of high fire severity."	19	2	0	0	16	2	23	2020-02-25	WOS:000512998900001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Our aim is to assess how intensity of cattle grazing and time since last fire influence plant species richness, dominance and assemblage composition.LocationCentral Midlands, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.MethodsSites differed in grazing intensity (light, moderate and heavy) and time since last fire: recently burned (RB) vs unburned (UB). We sampled plants in 24 vegetation quadrats (1-m(2)) randomly located within each site (similar to 1000m(2)). We used linear regression models for species richness and dominance, IndVal to identify indicator species and CCA for assemblage composition. All analyses were conducted at quadrat and site level.ResultsSpecies richness was significantly influenced by time since last fire (RB>UB), grazing intensity (light < moderate > heavy) and the fire-grazing interaction at quadrat level. Dominance reciprocated the response of species richness to time since last fire (UB>RB), but did not respond consistently to grazing intensity (light > moderate > or < heavy). Plant assemblage composition was significantly influenced by time since last fire, grazing intensity and vegetation structure (live vegetation cover and vegetation height). Indicator species of species-poor, heavily grazed sites included alien species, such as Cirsium vulgare and Conyza bonariensis.ConclusionResponse of species richness to grazing intensity conforms to the predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Burning and moderate grazing should be part of grassland management. To prevent species loss and influx of alien species, heavy grazing should be minimized. As development of grassland ecological networks in a timber matrix is being pioneered in South Africa, these findings indicate a way forward for the management of similar systems elsewhere in the world."	22	1	0	0	19	0	24	2017-07-01	WOS:000403676000004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

At 10 yrs after the original survey, the grazing regime had changed as described above. Since the exact locations of plots of the original survey could not be reconstructed, we placed the resurvey plots stratified randomly within the respective community types. Functional composition in relation to the environment was analysed with the RLQ approach using community means of Ellenberg species indicator values as proxies for environmental conditions.Results: Although the grazing regime changed in the same direction in the whole area, the wet and dry grasslands responded differently: when the changes are analysed for the whole data set, they are hidden behind the differences between vegetation types, and neither plant species alpha-and gamma-diversity, nor species composition changes are apparent. However, when analysed separately, diversity changes were negligible for the wet meadow communities, whereas both alpha-and gamma-diversity increased in the drier sites, leaving beta-diversity unchanged. Despite the minor changes in species diversity in the wet grassland, functional composition changed considerably towards graminoid species. In the dry communities, an increase in species richness was accompanied by an increase in functional richness, and a trend towards competitive strategist species.Conclusion: Even minor changes in grazing regime can significantly affect grassland communities, while the effects may vary strongly between vegetation types and incoherently across different measures of change. This suggests that thorough analysis of vegetation developments after management changes should be carried out on different levels of data set integration and should include severalmeasures of change."	18	0	0	0	16	1	20	2017-04-01	WOS:000398083700011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Recently, the possibility of managing these monospecific plantations to form mixed conifer-broad-leaved woodlands via natural regeneration processes has been considered. In light of this we pose the question, how does the interaction of cattle grazing and overstorey thinning (hereafter, thinning) affect natural regeneration in east Mediterranean pine plantations?Location: Menashe region, Mediterranean Israel (rainfall = 600 mm.yr(-1)). Methods: The experiment was carried out in a mature (50 yr) Pinus brutia plantation. Ten plots (0.25 ha) were selected, representing thinned (five plots, approximate to 100 trees.ha(-1), leaf area index, LAI approximate to 3) and non-thinned (five plots, approximate to 230 trees.ha(-1), LAI approximate to 6) forest patches. Paired 100-m(2) subplots were positioned within each plot, one of which was fenced to exclude cattle grazing while the other remained available for grazing. Recruitment, growth and shoot water potential of pines and broad-leaved tree species were measured after 10 yr of grazing exclusion.Results: The density of newly emerged (up to 3-mo-old) pine seedlings was decreased by thinning but not affected by grazing. However, pine sapling (established seedlings) density and height were increased by thinning and decreased by grazing. Sapling density of the dominant native oak Quercus ithaburensis was reduced by both thinning and grazing. Thinning enhanced the growth of Q. ithaburensis saplings while grazing restricted their height. Grazing and thinning had no significant effect on the total sapling density of broad-leaved tree species, but grazing restricted their height and reduced species richness. Grazing reduced topsoil water content in non-thinned plots but had no effect in the thinned plots. Grazing increased the water potential of pine seedlings while thinning reduced it. Both grazing and thinning had no effect on the water potential of mature Pistacia lentiscus shrubs.Conclusions: Natural regeneration within east Mediterranean pine plantations is limited by both dense overstorey cover and cattle grazing. While grazing exclusion is necessary for the establishment and early growth of recruits, reintroduction of grazing at later phases may facilitate the development of young forests by controlling competition."	20	1	0	0	12	1	21	2015-04-29	WOS:000352131500011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Location Florida rosemary scrub, Lake Wales Ridge, Highlands County, FL, USA (27 degrees 11'N, 81 degrees 21'W). Methods In nine grid plots located in intact Florida rosemary scrub, degraded scrub and improved pasture, we assessed percentage vegetation cover and seed bank composition. Results The vegetation was dominated by long-lived perennials, while the seed bank was dominated by short-lived species. Shrubs were the dominant above-ground cover in rosemary scrub, sub-shrubs and the spike moss Selaginella arenicola in degraded scrub and non-native grasses in pastures. Scrub forbs were dominant in the seed bank of rosemary scrub, similar amounts of sedges, ruderal forbs and scrub forbs in degraded scrub, and ruderal species and sedges in pastures. Species absent from the vegetation were randomly distributed in the seed bank, while species present above-ground had an aggregated spatial distribution. In rosemary scrub, scrub forb seed banks were spatially aggregated and were positively associated with conspecific species above-ground and with litter cover. These patterns were not observed in degraded scrub, perhaps due to reduced shrub and increased bare ground. Conclusion Our results suggest that reduced shrub cover and increased bare ground in the degraded scrub may explain why there is less spatial aggregation of scrub forbs in the seed bank. Restoration of Florida rosemary scrub in pasture sites will require species reintroduction of appropriate scrub species; restoration of degraded scrub should emphasize increasing shrub cover to restore habitat spatial structure."	14	1	0	0	12	1	15	2012-07-25	WOS:000305936800006	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Large plots sown with a regional seed mixture (RSM) were compared with three other 'lower cost' treatments - sowing narrow 2.5-m wide strips of the RSM into a matrix of commercial grasses (RCG), sowing strips of RSM into a matrix of natural regeneration (RNR) and natural regeneration alone (NR).Results are presented for years 2000, 2004 and 2009. Results: Regional grass species established and persisted in cover and species number, regional herb species established and persisted in number but declined in cover. Perennial weeds increased in years 2000-2004 but had declined by 2009. The vegetation showed a gradual convergence in the direction of the ancient meadow vegetation and the vegetation was species-rich but a long way from the ancient meadow composition.Conclusions: The experiment demonstrated lasting benefits of regional seed mixtures, including rapid establishment of meadow species with no perennial weed stage, producing vegetation suitable for haymaking. However, sowing regional seed mixtures is the most expensive method and colonization of these plots by unsown target species was slow. Satisfactory results were achieved by the cheaper method of sowing strips of regional seed mixture in a matrix of natural regeneration or natural regeneration alone, and colonization by unsown target species was the more successful here, although some of this was due to colonization (cross-contamination) from adjacent plots. The poorest results were in the commercial grass treatments due to strong competition from sown commercial grasses. Overall, to achieve biodiversity goals in grassland restoration it is essential to use seeds of regional provenance."	29	0	0	0	25	0	30	2012-03-28	WOS:000301047300010	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Soil properties and weather conditions were also monitored.Results: Aspect was related to total plant cover during early revegetation, and south-facing slopes had the lowest cover. Aspect also influenced the early dynamics of hydroseeded grasses and legumes establishing on these slopes. Grass cover was greater on the north slope throughout the Study, but differences in plant cover between north and south slopes appeared later for the legumes. Aspect also affected the relative contribution of both of grasses and legumes to the total plant cover, with grasses dominant on both northern and southern slopes, except during the summer on the southern slope. The species with the greatest difference in cover between the north- and south-facing slopes were Festuca spp., Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens.Conclusion: In coal mine reclamation areas of Mediterranean climates, differences in the development of hydroseeded species depended on the slope of the coal mine reclamation areas, and this information is of importance to managers in selecting species for use in reclamation.d"	33	1	0	0	26	0	34	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800013	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Japan.Methods: Soil samples were collected at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cut depths from seven plots in forests. grasslands, artificially matted areas and bare land. Soil seed banks were assessed using the seedling emergence method Followed by the hand-sorting of Ungerminated seeds. We determined the size and composition of the seed banks in tipper soil layers of plots and compared the seed banks to the standing vegetation,Results: A total of 12 220 seedlings belonging to 42 species front 20 families germinated. Total mean seed density (0-5 cm depth) was low in all plots within forest, grassland, and heavily degraded vegetation types (34.7 +/- 8.6 to 693.5 +/- 123.6. 58.6 +/- 7.8 to 107.1 +/- 10.0, and 1,1 +/- 0.5 to 7.2 +/- 2.3 seeds/m(2), respectively). Forbs and graminoids dominated the seed banks of grassland and forest plots including Cyperus brevifolius, Gnaphalium pensylvanicum, Oxalis corniculata and Solanum nigrum, and these alien species comprised 90% of the density of the seed bank. There was little correlation between seed banks and standing vegetation of the island (Sorensen similarity coefficient values 0.26 to 0.45).Conclusions: If natural regeneration occurs from the seed bank of the island, future vegetation will not move toward the original forest community, because the seed bank is dominated by non-native herbaceous grassland species. Though isolated, a few forest remnants with low species richness could be an important source for the natural re-establishment of forest on the island; however, seed availability may be limited by either poor dispersal or pollination so that woody species will probably recover very slowly on this goat-impacted island."	6	0	0	0	5	0	6	2008-08-01	WOS:000263168800008	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Few studies have recognised the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, in the form of historical roadworks activities, on adjacent roadside plant populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soil disturbance from roadworks on the spatial patterns and structural dynamics of roadside Acacia populations in an agricultural area in southeastern Australia. Stem size and disturbance data were collected from 135 roadside populations of three species of Acacia shrubs in the Lockhart Shire area. Spatial pattern analysis using the Network K-function and Discriminant Function analyses showed that road verge width, road category, disturbance intensity and distance to nearest town were highly significant variables in relation to disturbance from roadworks and shrub structural dynamics. Colonising populations were more abundant along gravel roads where soil disturbance intensity was high, whereas stable populations were more abundant where soil disturbance intensity was low. Senescent populations were more abundant in narrow, little used road verge corridors 4-6 km from nearby towns. These results suggest that anthropogenic disturbance regimes may be critical to shrub recruitment and persistence in roadside environments, which has important consequences for conservation of threatened native flora and fauna in agricultural landscapes."	22	0	0	0	20	0	26	2004-05-01	WOS:000221960200008	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In particular, detailed but integrative approaches are required to assimilate large databases on vegetation and to make them directly useful for managers and restorers.We describe two case studies undertaken to evaluate the effects of logging or overgrazing on plant species diversity in pine forests of southern France and steppe ecosystems of southern Tunisia. Both studies employed the same methodology to identify plant functional traits (morphological, life history and regeneration traits) associated with community response to disturbance. The results of these analyses allowed us to develop state and transition models that could be used to plan and predict ecosystem trajectories, assess ongoing degradation processes and monitor community and ecosystem responses to management and restoration practices.

This chronosequence was investigated using indirect ordination methods. The position of the vegetation types in the ordination diagram was found not to infer any temporal sequence. Independent observations show that the change of vegetation type is slow and does not necessarily occur among types adjacent in the ordination diagram. Furthermore, direct ordination revealed that environmental parameters such as pH, the levels of available phosphate and organic carbon as well as the age of the study sites do not significantly account for the variance. Instead, attention needs to be paid to the influence of spatial aspects and also what recultivation measures have been carried out. A detailed account of the vegetation dynamics of individual sample plots showed - depending on the respective vegetation type - divergence, convergence, and fluctuation at the smallest spatial scale. While the species richness of the sample plots remained more or less constant after initial colonization, mean vegetation cover continuously increases with age, although some sites still remain free of vegetation after as long as 70 yr. No general trend in dominant life forms was indicated. A conceptual model of early succession mechanisms is outlined and Five basic mechanisms are identified (i.e. site availability, site suitability, availability of diaspores, strategies of colonizing species and biotic interactions). Their respective importance in three different stages of early succession is estimated and compared.

This study addresses the existing gap in long-term monitoring of trophic rewilding by using year-round grazing as a proxy and explores the effect of year-round grazing semi-feral horses (Equus ferus caballus) and cattle (Bos taurus) on European protected habitats.Locations 45 management areas across Denmark, lowland Europe.Methods Utilising data from the existing Danish national vegetation-monitoring scheme, we evaluate the ecological effect across 45 year-round grazed management areas spanning up to two decades. Our evaluation extends beyond considering species richness as we apply a range of ecological indicator values. We used Linear Mixed-Effect Models (LMM) to explore the effect of the predictor years of grazing management on several response variables.Results Year-round grazing in natural areas in Denmark generally promotes plant species richness, rare and light-demanding plants, but effects vary among habitat types. The findings reveal notable changes in plant communities over time with year-round grazing, signifying the improvement of dry grassland habitats towards species-rich, open herbaceous habitats. However, the effect of year-round grazing in wetlands is complex; while alpha-diversity decreases, regionally rare species (unicity) increase.Conclusion With these insights on the effects of year-round grazing, conservation managers can strategically prioritise management intervention and monitoring.

We measured net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration and normalized difference vegetation index on a regular basis over the growing season. Samples were taken from 60 cm deep soil profiles for analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC).ResultsThe grazed sites showed significantly more negative NEE than the NG sites, indicating more carbon dioxide uptake on the grazed sites compared to the NG sites. The normalized difference vegetation index was also significantly higher on the grazed sites. On all farms, the total SOC content was higher in the grazed sites than in the parallel NG sites.ConclusionsThe study indicates that cessation of grazing decreases productivity and carbon dioxide uptake in a semi-natural grassland in Iceland, as well as SOC content in the soil. Historically, all the NG sites in the study had the same grazing history as the continuously grazed sites until grazing exclusion. The measured lower SOC on the NG sites seems to indicate that, without grazing, SOC is lost with time and/or grazing is needed to maintain SOC in these grasslands.We studied the effect of intensive grazing, extensive grazing, and long-term no grazing on semi-natural grasslands in Iceland.

Little is known about how the ecosystem services of reforested landscapes with an agricultural land-use history will differ from reference forests. Our objectives were to (i) test the hypothesis that forests with a history of agricultural land use can provide the same carbon storage and biomass ecosystem services as adjacent reference forests, given some recovery time; (ii) explore whether there is a lag in the recovery of forest community composition due to prior agricultural land use; and (iii) demonstrate how remote-sensing methods can improve our understanding of land-use legacies at large spatial scales.Location: Finger Lakes National Forest, NY, USA.Methods: Using historic air photos, landscape-scale lidar, and field surveys, we compared differences in biomass storage, forest structure, and vegetation communities between reference forests and post-agricultural forests at different stages of regeneration in the Finger Lakes National Forest, New York, USA. We also used lidar to create a spatial model of biomass across the landscape to analyze the spatial distribution of biomass across our study area.Results: We found biomass and forest structure in post-agricultural forests generally recovered to levels typical of reference forests within 50 years of abandonment. Conversely, we found the composition of woody and herbaceous communities still varied between reference and post-agricultural forests after 50 years of abandonment.Conclusions: Collectively our results indicate afforestation efforts can be effective for carbon sequestration at early stages of forest succession.

We ask how heathland development is related to these factors and what are the implications for conservation management and restoration.Location North German Plain.Methods We collected 350 releves in 18 dry Calluna heathland areas. Plant communities were classified using Isopam, and Redundancy Analysis (RDA) determined effects of environmental conditions. Potential pathways of development and the nature conservation status of the communities were identified on a multifactorial basis.Results We found nine floristically and structurally distinct heathland plant communities. Heathland vegetation showed distinct patterns along Calluna age development stages and environmental conditions. Soil conditions and related effects of long-term site history and recent management turned out to be the predominant factors influencing species composition and diversity, resulting in three potential heathland succession pathways. Mosaic-like communities with particularly high taxonomic diversity and conservation value occurred on early-successional inland dunes or as regeneration stage growing on nutrient-poor sandy soils without humus accumulation.Conclusions The study reveals fundamental differences between historically farmed heathland in the oceanic Northwest and former military training areas mainly in northeastern Germany with consequences for restoration ecology.

To determine how resilient native grasslands are to the re-introduction of fire, we quantify how fire affects the resprouting of the dominant C-3 tussock grasses in long-unburned grasslands (Austrostipa spp.) and compare this to the recovery of C-4 tussock grasses (Themeda triandra) in grasslands that have had regular exposure to fire. We also quantify if these two grassland types burn in different ways as a result of their different dominant grass compositions.Location Temperate native tussock grasslands on the Victorian volcanic plain, Australia.Methods To determine how fire affects tussock mortality, and whether this differs between C-4 (regularly ) and C-3 (long-unburned) grasslands, tussocks were permanently marked pre-fire and re-censused for survival and growth at seven weeks after fire. To assess whether C-3 grasslands burn in a different way to C-4 grasslands, fire behaviour was quantified at 11 sites.Results Fire behaviour was similar in both grassland types. Both C-3 and C-4 grass tussocks were resilient to fire, despite decades of fire suppression in C-3 grasslands. Tussock mortality was low (<5%) in both C-3 and C-4 grasses. Survival was independent of basal circumference in C-4 Themeda tussocks, but smaller-sized tussocks (<10 cm circumference) were less likely to survive fire in C-3 Austrostipa grasslands. Basal area declined in both grasses after fire but rate of tiller regrowth after fire was similar for both grass types.Conclusion Long-unburned C-3 grass tussocks were resilient to a single fire. Future studies should examine the response of C-3 grasses to a fire regime that comprises frequent return intervals to which C-4 grasses are resilient; this may indicate whether C-3 grasses are sensitive to short fire-return intervals despite resilience to an individual fire event."	8	0	0	0	6	1	8	2020-02-12	WOS:000510574100001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

After 9 yrs, the number of species (on average 16 per plot) did not differ between the turf and its surroundings. Most of these species had been transferred and are typical of the local meadow vegetation, making up most of the plant cover. Weedy species, originally abundant on the ex-arable land, did not penetrate the turf and retreated with time. The species composition converged between the turf and its surroundings, but it also changed from that of the turf source meadow. This was mainly due to the expansion of the strongly competitive grass Brachypodium pinnatum at the expense of Bromus erectus. The species that spread best to the arable land had a high leaf dry matter content. Species with the best performance in the turf had high ability for lateral clonal spread.Conclusion: Turf transplantation promoted the establishment of targetmeadow species on ex-arable land and supported restoration of meadow vegetation, but plant species composition changed from the turf source meadow, and expansion of target species from the turf into the surrounding area required a long time period."	11	0	0	0	9	0	11	2017-03-30	WOS:000396473500008	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We used species-rich permanent grasslands of medium management intensity (PG-M) as a reference, and asked the following questions: (1) do permanent grasslands with low and high management intensities (PG-L and PG-H, respectively) have different plant diversity and species composition than reference grasslands; and (2) do secondary grasslands recovering from conversion to arable fields (SG-A) or pine plantations (SG-P) differ from permanent grasslands in their plant species composition and abiotic conditions?LocationHighland grasslands, Campos de Cima da Serra, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil.MethodsWe analysed variation in plant species composition and diversity among 80 grassland sites, including three types of permanent grassland and two types of secondary grassland. An indicator species analysis was used to identify characteristic species for the different land-use types. We used a linear discriminant analysis to investigate differences in soil conditions among land-use types.ResultsBoth PG-L and PG-H differed from PG-M regarding plant species composition. Although PG-L shared many typical grassland species with PG-M, their communities were generally less diverse. PG-H, on the other hand, not only had fewer species but also deviated from PG-M in species composition. Secondary grasslands on former arable fields and plantations differed from PG-M in species composition and showed lower diversity. Soil conditions of SG-P were similar to those of PG-L and PG-M, but they were distinct from those of PG-H and SG-A.ConclusionsAll land-use types showed deviations from reference grasslands (PG-M). The decrease in the number of species in PG-L may be reversed if traditional management intensity is re-introduced, whereas strong compositional changes in SG-P may require the re-introduction of grassland species. This is also true for PG-H and SG-A: both showed marked deviations from reference grasslands in biotic and abiotic components. Overall, restoration of altered land-use types to near-natural subtropical grassland seems feasible, but suitable techniques have to be developed."	33	0	0	0	28	5	34	2016-11-23	WOS:000386136600006	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We asked whether tree planting for ecological restoration accelerates epiphyte community recovery. Does the spatial configuration of tree planting matter? What landscape contexts are most suitable for epiphyte restoration?Location: Restored pastures in premontane Coto Brus County, Puntarenas, Costa Rica.Methods: We surveyed vascular epiphyte species growing on the lower trunks of 1083 trees in 13 experimental restoration sites. Each site contained three 0.25-ha treatment plots: natural regeneration, trees planted in patches or 'islands' and tree plantations. Sites spanned elevational (1100-1430 m) and deforestation (4-94% forest cover within a 100-m radius around each site) gradients.Results: Vascular epiphytes were twice as diverse in planted restoration plots (islands and plantations) as in natural regeneration; we observed this at the scale of individual host trees and within 0.25-ha treatment plots. Contributing factors included that trees in planted restoration plots were larger, older, more abundant and composed of different species than trees in naturally regenerating plots. Epiphyte species richness increased with surrounding forest cover within 100150 m of restoration plots. Epiphyte communities were also twice as diverse at higher (1330-1430 m) vs lower (1100-1290 m) elevation sites. Epiphyte groups responded differently to restoration treatments and landscape factors; ferns were responsible for higher species richness in planted restoration plots, whereas angiosperms drove elevation and forest cover effects.Conclusions: Tree planting for ecological restoration enriched epiphyte communities compared to natural regeneration, likely because planted forests contained more, bigger and older trees. Tree island plantings were equally effective compared to larger and more expensive plantations. Restoration sites nearer to existing forests had richer epiphyte recolonization, likely because nearby forests provisioned restoration sites with angiosperm seeds. Collectively, results suggest that restoration practitioners can enrich epiphyte community development by planting trees in areas with higher surrounding forest cover, particularly at higher elevations."	22	0	0	0	20	1	24	2016-07-01	WOS:000384751300014	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

(b) Are the target stages predictable? (c) How do species richness and environmental characteristics change during succession? (d) What are the consequences for restoration and landscape management?Location: The Bohemian Karst Protected Landscape Area, SW of Prague, Czech Republic (49 degrees 52'-50 degrees 00' N, 14 degrees 03'-14 degrees 21' E, 251-488 m a.s.l.).Methods: In a repeated analysis, phytosociological releve's recorded in 4 m 9 4 m plots in 58 old-fields initially surveyed in 1975 were compared to those from 28 still existing fields in 2008-2009. Average Ellenberg indicator values were calculated for each releve'. Aspect and slope were measured and potential radiation calculated. pH was measured from soil samples. Species were grouped according to their affiliation to the phytosociological classes Querco-Fagetea, Festuco-Brometea, Trifolio-Geranietea, Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, and weedy and ruderal vegetation. Those belonging to the first three classes were considered target species. The data were analysed using multivariate (ordination methods) and univariate statistics.Results: The spontaneous succession in old-fields proceeded towards target stages, either deciduous woodlands or shrubby grasslands. Their establishment can be tentatively predicted by soil pH and early occurrence of grassland species. Except pH, all Ellenberg indicator values changed during succession. pH values (Ellenberg and measured) were higher in shrubby grasslands than in woodlands. The total number of species decreased during succession, the number of target woodland species increased, and target grassland species remained the same in the shrubby grassland stages but decreased in the woodland stages during the past 33 yr of succession.Conclusions: Target shrubby grasslands, resembling natural steppe-like communities typical of the region and valuable from a conservation point of view, can be restored by spontaneous succession within a few decades in about one-third of the studied old-fields. Other fields developed into deciduous woodland. Restoration of well-developed target woodland will take longer, but the trend is already obvious, although less desirable nitrophilous woodland might also alternatively develop. Repeating earlier chronosequence studies may provide valuable information useful in restoration ecology and landscape management."	53	0	0	0	48	1	59	2012-04-01	WOS:000301047300009	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do the relationships between traits and performance depend on neighboring functional groups?LocationA former agricultural field, being restored to native upland prairie, in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon, USA.MethodsTwenty-eight native species, representing three functional groups, were sown in seven different combinations. Eleven functional traits were measured from plants in the laboratory and in the field. Correlations between individual traits and performance variables were measured and regression techniques used to determine which sets of traits were most strongly related to performance.ResultsSets of traits explained up to 56% of variation in cover, and up to 48% of variation in establishment frequency. The relationships between traits and performance were influenced by functional group identity; the functional group identity of neighboring species also influenced species' cover and the relationships between traits and cover. Species' establishment rate in monoculture was the trait most strongly correlated to both establishment and cover in mixtures. In multi-trait models, annual forb functional group identity was strongly related to establishment in mixtures, and height, leaf weight ratio at 7 d and seed mass were strongly related to cover.ConclusionsMultiple-trait models should be a useful way of predicting the performance of species prior to sowing in restoration.

Species frequency was determined for 1001-m(2) quadrats. The dominant grass, Andropogon virginicus, was removed with herbicide from moist and dry sites to test for possible effects of competition.Results: Slopes of log-log species-area relationships were steep (0.195 to 0.379). Time since burn did not affect the richness of herbaceous plants, only woody species. More than half of all species recorded (43/79, 54 %) were infrequent (in < 10 % of quadrats). After two years, there were no differences in species richness and composition for plots with and without A. virginicus.Conclusions: The high species diversity is typical of other savannas across the coastal plain. The large number of infrequent species indicates that the core-satellite pattern of species occurrence found in temperate grasslands does not apply to southern pine savannas. The absence of effects due to removal of a dominant may be due to insufficient observation time, or low competition. Most species have traits, such as diminutive life forms, that suggest they are weak competitors for light in the presence of robust matrix grasses and in the absence of fire. Many species in Pinus palustris savannas are likely either fugitive or peripheral species."	26	2	0	0	26	0	36	2006-05-01	WOS:000242292500004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Major gradients in vegetation composition were identified using DCA. CCA was used to relate vegetation gradients to abiotic and spatio-historical variables.Results: A clear segregation of species assemblages was observed, from open and undisturbed bogs to forested and highly disturbed sites. Among abiotic factors, tree basal area. water table level and peat thickness had a significant influence on plant species composition. Among spatio-historical factors. disturbance level, area loss and fire were the most influential factors. Variance partitioning between these groups of factors suggests that spatio-historical factors had a major influence on peatlands. representing 22% of the variation observed in the plant species assemblages while abiotic factors represent only 17% of the variation.Conclusions: The results highlight the influence of agricultural and other anthropogenic activities on plant assemblages and suggest that even wetlands apparently resistant to disturbances. such as peatlands, can be severely affected by anthropogenic factors.

In this study, we investigate whether the seed bank might be useful for restoring the above-ground plant species richness. We studied the vegetation and seed bank composition at six species-rich and six species-poor ditch banks, where agri-environment schemes are running to maintain and enhance ditch bank plant diversity. We show that the number of species in the seed bank was low, regardless of the number of species in the established vegetation. Moreover, the seed bank was always dissimilar to the established vegetation. Target species for nature conservation were occasionally present in the seed bank at both species-poor and species-rich sites, but rarely so if the species was absent from the established vegetation. We conclude that the potential use of the seed bank for restoration of ditch banks is minimal. At present, plant species richness seems to be largely controlled by germination opportunities; high biomass and competition appear to hamper germination at species-poor sites. We recommend continued nutrient reduction at such sites.

In 1981 Somerford Mead was ploughed for the first time and converted to arable land. Seeds of an Alopecurus pratensis-Sanguisorba officinalis flood-meadow community MG4; Rodwell 1992) were sown onto prepared soil in the autumn of 1986, and botanical records were made from 1985 to 1999. From 1989 to 1999, three replicates of three treatments: cow-grazing, sheep-grazing and no-grazing were introduced after hay-cutting. Analysis successfully separated the establishment phase from the experimental phase and showed a significant difference between the grazed and ungrazed treatments. Abiotic and biotic factors which might contribute to successional trends are discussed. A convoluted pattern for each treatment could be attributed in part to intrinsic 'cycles' of perennial hemicryptophytes behaving as short-lived species and in part to the percentage frequency of many species which was reduced in 1990 and 1995/1996, years of drought. After the initial inoculation of MG4 seed and the disappearance of arable therophytes, recruitment of new species was very slow. Coefficients for Somerford Mead matched against MG4 (Rodwell 1992) produced an equilibrium within three years. It subsequently fluctuated over a 10-yr period well below the level of Oxey Mead, the donor site.Land managers should ensure that their proposed site has the right soils and hydrology for MG4 grassland and that traditional management of hay-cutting and aftermath grazing is practised.

A comparison of the actual vegetation in the permanent plots with reference releves of the selected vegetation type revealed a gradually increasing similarity during consecutive years for five vegetation types. This was due to the occurrence of an increasing number of target species and the number of permanent plots they occurred in.

Within this savanna landscape large parts of the remaining dry forests still exist with a unique biotic diversity, both in terms of total number of species and endemism. Unfortunately, mainly man-induced uncontrolled fires threaten these forests. Actual and former fire regimes of the local communities are analysed. The use of fire is an integrated part of land use and is also governed by socio-cultural traditions. The impact of fire on the dynamics of dry forests and grass savannas is studied considering the specifics of different fire regimes. We propose that a deliberate and controlled use of fire respecting the vegetation stage and the defined objectives could be an appropriate management tool. The strategy of a fire management is elaborated considering both the conservation of biodiversity and improvement of the livelihood of the local population depending upon the Reserve's resources.

These habitats are of high conservation value, but their abandonment in the 20th century triggered slow natural succession that poses a threat to specialized plant species. We asked how this vegetation and its plant diversity have changed over the past three decades and whether protected areas have positively affected habitat quality.Location Southwestern and central Moravia, Czech Republic.Methods In 2018-2019, we resurveyed 94 vegetation plots first sampled in 1986-1991 at 47 acidic dry grassland and heathland sites. We compared the number of all vascular plant species, Red List species and alien species per plot using parametric and non-parametric tests, life-form spectra using the chi-square test, species composition using detrended correspondence analysis, and indicator values using a permutation test. We also compared these changes between sites within and outside protected areas.Results Vegetation changes over the past three decades have been relatively small. However, we detected a decrease in total species richness, the number of Red List species and the number of characteristic species of dry grasslands. Neophytes were infrequent, while archaeophytes increased slightly. The competitive tall grass Arrhenatherum elatius, annual species and young woody plants increased in abundance or newly established at many sites.

Recent empirical evidence also points to plant maximum height, as a functional trait that potentially drives forest above-ground biomass (AGB). However, the interrelations between these biotic variables are complex, and it is not always predictable if structural diversity attributes or functional metrics of plant maximum height would act as the most important determinant of stand biomass. Here we evaluated the relative importance of structural diversity attributes and functional metrics of plant maximum height (Hmax) in predicting and mediating AGB response to variation in species richness in mixed-species forests, while also accounting for fine-scale environmental variation.Location: Northern Benin.Methods: We used forest inventory data from mixed-species stands of native and exotic species. We quantified structural diversity as coefficient of variation of tree diameter at breast height (CVdbh) and of height (CVHt). For plant Hmax, we computed three metrics: functional range (FRHmax), functional divergence (FDHmax) and community-weighted mean (CWMHmax). We used topographical variables such as elevation and slope to account for possible environmental effects. Simple and multiple mixed-effects models, and structural equation models were performed to assess the direct and indirect links of AGB with species richness through structural diversity attributes and functional metrics of plant Hmax.Results: Species richness and CVdbh were positively related to AGB, while functional metrics of plant Hmax were not. Structural equation models revealed that species richness influenced AGB indirectly via CVdbh, which alone strongly promoted AGB. Elevation only had a positive direct effect on AGB. While increasing species richness enhanced CVdbh and functional measures of plant Hmax, there was no support for the latter mediating the effects of species richness on AGB.Conclusion: Structural diversity has a significant advantage in predicting and mediating the positive effect of species richness on AGB more so than functional measures of plant Hmax. We argue that structural diversity acts as a mechanism for the species richness-AGB relationship, and that maintaining high structural diversity would enhance biomass in mixed-species forests."	15	0	0	0	10	0	18	2023-09-25	WOS:001000367400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	YES

We asked how restoration approach, past land use, site and landscape variables affected the richness and composition of vascular plants (field and shrub layers), bryophytes and lichens in middle-aged forests. Location Thirty-three birch stands in Estonia. Methods Data were collected from stands on former agricultural land that originated from plantations (PL-A) or natural regeneration (NR-A), and for reference, from native forest land (NR-F). In every stand a 10 m x 10 m survey plot was established. Generalised Linear Mixed Models were used to test the effect of restoration approach, past land use, soil, light, stand and landscape variables on species richness estimates. Compositional patterns were analysed using Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and indicator species analysis. Results Altogether 215 vascular plant, 70 bryophyte and 63 lichen species were found. The effects of restoration approach, past land use, and site and landscape variables on the species richness varied depending on the taxonomic and ecological groups of species. The richness of shrubs and bryophytes was higher in NR-A than in PL-A, and both variables were also related to soil properties. The richness of the field layer was related to past land use because previous croplands hosted fewer forest species than previous grasslands and stands on forest land. Higher current forest cover around the studied stands increased the richness of lichens, which were also affected by light and soil conditions. Species composition differed among the three stand types; however, the previous land use (agriculture vs forest) had a stronger effect than the restoration approach. Conclusions Although natural forest regeneration promoted biodiversity the most, plantations also supported the recovery of biodiversity at abandoned agricultural sites.

Shrub-canopy layer, forest tree species composition and structure, and total forest basal area were also measured.Results: In both uneven-aged and even-aged managed forest stands, we found: (a) a substantial decrease in mean plant phylogenetic diversity compared with unmanaged forest, even 30 years after harvesting (i.e., decrease of 16% and 22%, respectively); and (b) lowest plant alpha-diversity in the herb layer 15 years after harvesting. Modification of community composition based upon dissimilarity (beta-diversity) metrics demonstrated more numerous effects of even-aged management than uneven-aged management. For forest composition and structure, plant community and plant traits, dissimilarity relative to the unmanaged control was highest 5 years after even-aged management. Trait-based communities were more similar to unmanaged forest at the intermediate levels of forest density (i.e., similar to 20 m(2)/ha) that were found 5 years after uneven-aged management.Conclusions: Forest management clearly affected diversity, community composition and ecosystem functions along the chronosequence, highlighting the strongest effects of more intensive management (i.e., even-aged) and the need to improve the sustainability of forest management."	3	0	0	0	3	0	4	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Jura Mountains and Vosges Mountains (France). Methods In 2019, we resampled old phytosociological releves (made from 2005 to 2009) in extensive mountain hay meadows. To detect shifts in composition from old to recent releves, we performed a permutational multivariate analysis of variance, and visualized observed patterns using non-metric multidimensional scaling on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix of the vegetation data. We tested for differences in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics, CSR strategies and ecological indicator values using paired Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Results Non-metric multidimensional scaling paired with a permutational multivariate analysis of variance showed that, overall, old and recent plant communities were not different in the Vosges Mountains, contrary to the situation in the Jura Mountains. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney paired tests revealed that, in the Jura Mountains, plant communities underwent a significant decrease in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, associated with an increase of ruderal and competitive strategies. Ecological indicator values for nutrient availability and defoliation tolerance both increased, suggesting an intensification of agricultural practices. In the Vosges Mountains, only species richness increased while the inverse Simpson index and Pielou evenness decreased. Conclusions Our results show that plant diversity is not currently threatened in the studied grasslands in the Vosges Mountains. By contrast, in the studied grasslands in the Jura Mountains, plant diversity is declining. The situation in the Vosges shows that agricultural activities and biodiversity conservation can be reconciled. This situation should be further investigated to help resolve conflicts between agriculture and biodiversity conservation in semi-natural grasslands."	6	0	0	0	4	0	6	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000022	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We investigated how restoration methods, soil characteristics, time since sowing or abandonment, proximity effects, and climate influence vegetation changes and restoration success in the restored grasslands. We particularly asked: (a) which of the studied environmental factors influence the course of restoration of dry grasslands and how much; (b) what is their hierarchy; and (c) what are the implications for ecological restoration? Location White Carpathians Protected Landscape Area, eastern Czech Republic. Methods We studied 82 dry grasslands restored on former arable land, either sown with a regional or commercial clover-grass seed mixture or left to spontaneous succession, and compared them with ancient dry grasslands as reference sites. Data were processed using Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to test the relationships between two measures of restoration success (number of colonizing target species and Bray-Curtis similarity between restored and reference vegetation) and the environmental factors. Results The ordination results demonstrate some convergence of grasslands restored with different methods toward reference sites. Using regional seed mixtures led to a higher participation of dry grassland species, while using commercial seed mixtures and spontaneous succession favored mesic grassland species. All tested groups of environmental variables exhibited some significant effects on the course of restoration. Their hierarchy varied depending on the vegetation characteristic we used but generally, restoration method and soil factors appeared to be the most important, followed by time since sowing or abandonment, climatic factors, and proximity effects.

(b) Do these differences vary among three regions with different climates, representing a gradient from arid to sub-humid conditions? Location Northeastern Iran. Methods We compared plots intensively grazed by sheep and goat (HG) to plots with low grazing intensity (LG), across three climatic regions: arid, semi-arid and sub-humid. Species diversity (expressed as ShannonH) was compared using linear mixed-effect models. Dissimilarity analysis was used to estimate the compositional heterogeneity of different types of plots, reflecting the differences in species composition. Indicator Species Analysis was used to identify individual species associated with particular types of plots. Results The HG plots had lower values of ShannonHthan LG plots, across all climatic regions. Further, the effect of grazing on species diversity varied between the climatic regions, with the most pronounced differences between the HG and LG plots in the sub-humid region. Although no differences in species diversity were detected between the three climatic regions, compositional heterogeneity was the highest in the sub-humid region and the lowest in the semi-arid region, with the most pronounced differences between the HG and LG plots in the sub-humid region. Indicator Species Analysis showed significant main effects of both climate and grazing on species composition, revealing species that respond to grazing in each of the three climatic regions. Conclusions Overgrazing was detected to reduce the diversity of species in all three climatic regions, even though its effect was most pronounced in the sub-humid region. Therefore, the control of overgrazing or reduction of its intensity appears an effective management tool for protecting species diversity, applicable in areas with different climates."	19	0	0	0	15	0	21	2020-08-19	WOS:000556423900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, livestock impacts on the vegetation have not been assessed. Furthermore, we have a limited understanding of the impacts of large-bodied browsing livestock, such as camels, in woodland and forest rangelands. Therefore, in this study, we examine the effects of livestock browsing on the species composition, density, and phytomorphology of woody vegetation in the Anogeissus cloud forests in the Dhofar Mountains of Oman.Location Data were collected at 30 sites in the Jabal Qamar mountain range in western Dhofar, Oman.Methods The point-centred quarter method was used to sample the composition, density and structure of woody vegetation. Constrained correspondence analysis was used to quantify the effects of livestock browsing on woody plant species composition, whilst effects on plant density were analysed using mixed-effects models. Standardised major axis regression was used to examine differences in height-diameter allometry (stunting) under different stocking rates.Results Fog density, topographic position and long-term stocking rates were found to be important factors affecting woody species composition. We found lower species diversity and plant density, and higher frequencies of unpalatable species, under higher stocking rates. Juveniles showed a stronger response to stocking rates than adults, and several common species exhibited stunted morphology under high stocking rates.Conclusions Browsing by large-bodied livestock, such as camels and cattle, can substantially alter the species composition, structure, and phytomorphology of woody vegetation in semi-arid woodlands and forests. Juveniles are particularly susceptible to browsing which alters woody vegetation demography and inhibits regeneration potential. Our results support previous suggestions of overstocking in Dhofar and highlight the importance of swift measures to reduce livestock browsing pressure in the Anogeissus cloud forests."	14	1	0	0	12	0	20	2020-05-14	WOS:000529301700001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Are there differences in the capacity of leguminous and non-leguminous trees in sustaining understory herbaceous biomass? And finally, to what extent does plant community composition underneath trees modulate the effects of herbivore assemblage and abundance on herbaceous biomass? Location Pasturelands and protected areas along the borders of the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, East Africa. Method Monthly herbaceous biomass was monitored non-destructively using a calibrated pasture disc. Measurements were taken within a network of paired exclosures and open plots, underneath large leguminous and non-leguminous tree canopies and outside canopies. Herbivore community assemblage compositions and abundances were characterised using monthly dung counts, and herbaceous plant community composition was surveyed annually every wet season over two years. Results Overall, we found that trees promote herbaceous standing biomass, particularly in the presence of moderate herbivory rather than under herbivore exclusion. Greater herbivore abundance and livestock dominance reduced herbaceous plant biomass, but trees, particularly leguminous trees, limited these negative effects. This capacity for trees to limit the effect of herbivores was related to herbaceous plant species composition. Understory plant communities that were compositionally typical of protected areas sustained the highest plant biomass when found in pasturelands with high herbivore pressure. Conclusion Our findings give greater credence to the importance of preserving large trees in savannah landscapes increasingly dominated by high abundances of livestock. Moreover, our results highlight that park managers and pastoralists need to maintain the specialist herbaceous understory community beneath trees in order to benefit from facilitative tree-understory interactions."	10	0	0	0	6	0	11	2020-01-16	WOS:000507499200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, recovery of other plant species is often very limited. One barrier is high soil acidity following sod cutting, which results in soil aluminium (Al3+) and ammonium (NH4+) reaching toxic concentrations. Sod-cutting management also removes most of the major nutrients from the system, so intensified nutrient limitation could be an additional barrier to the recovery of species-rich communities. Soil phosphorus (P) is of special interest as research indicates sod-cutting management can shift the system to P limitation. Location Hoge Veluwe National Park, The Netherlands. Methods We set up a full-factorial experiment in sod-cut heathland formerly encroached by Molinia caerulea, adding phosphate (P+) and lime (Ca+) and over the next three growing seasons, we recorded soil chemistry and plant responses. Results Soil inorganic N, especially soil NH4+, strongly declined after liming compared to the control situation, confirming that liming alleviates NH4+ toxicity. Addition of P resulted in a similar decline, also suggesting a role for soil phosphate availability in this process. Acid-sensitive plant species richness increased significantly in both Ca+ and P+ treatment, whereas acid-insensitive plant species richness only increased significantly as a result of P+ treatment. Mean vegetation relative growth rate increased significantly in both Ca+ and P+ treatments. Conclusions Excessive P removal due to sod cutting constitutes a second barrier to restoration in addition to soil acidity. We discourage the large-scale use of sod cutting to reduce soil N availability in heathlands and propose to use interventions that leave the soil nutrient balance intact, such as burning and grazing, mowing or litter removal, in combination with measures that restore the soil buffer capacity."	15	0	0	0	14	0	15	2020-01-14	WOS:000505666200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is there a spontaneous redevelopment towards the original steppe vegetation after reintroduction of the traditional grazing system? Can differences in functional trait composition be identified according to different land-use types? Do traits of selected species affect the ability to recolonize fallow land? Location Mediterranean steppe of La Crau (Southeastern France). Methods We conducted 80 vegetation surveys and soil analyses in the steppe and adjacent fallow land in six locations in La Crau in 2015; for three locations, data from 2001 were included. To compare the functional composition of steppe vs fallow land, community-weighted means (CMW) of specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and canopy height were calculated. To test whether trait variability is associated with the recolonization success of 12 selected target species, we measured SLA, LDMC, canopy height, plant width and aboveground biomass on eight replicate individuals per site and species. Results Fallow land was characterized by lower species richness and elevated phosphorus and potassium content in the soil. Comparing vegetation releves between 2001 and 2015 revealed that the fallows were developing towards steppe vegetation. CWMs of SLA were significantly lower and CWM of LDMC higher in steppe than in fallow land. There was no similarity in trait composition between steppe species that successfully recolonized the fallow-land community, and no evidence that intraspecific trait variability is associated with recolonization success of these species. Conclusions Even after decades of abandonment and reintroduction of the grazing system, the vegetation structure, soil properties and plant functional trait composition of fallows differ from those of adjacent steppe communities. These results illustrate the need for active restoration to accelerate the recovery of former arable land to the target steppe communities."	35	1	0	0	29	0	37	2019-01-01	WOS:000459825800008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Transplanting of vegetation turfs into disturbed areas has been used as a restoration method in disturbed alpine sites. The aim of this study is to investigate which environmental factors influence the vegetation recovery in turf surroundings and how turf attributes contribute to vegetation recovery.Location: Restored roads in a former military training area, Dovrefjell mountain range, central Norway.Methods: We recorded species richness, vegetation cover and soil characteristics of transplanted turfs and turf surroundings in roads restored between 3 and 14 years ago. Linear and generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate the relative importance of turf attributes and soil factors for recovery of turf surroundings.Results: Time was the most important factor for vegetation recovery, but soil conditions in turf surroundings were also highly important. Species richness and vegetation cover in turf surroundings were almost twice as high on silt-dominated soil and with presence of soil organic matter compared to on coarser soils and without organic matter. Species richness in turfs and turf surroundings was almost equal after 14 years, and the similarity of the species composition was high. Neither turf size, distance to the second closest turf or species richness and vegetation cover of the turfs were important factors for vegetation recovery in the turf surroundings.Conclusion: This study demonstrates the importance of preparing the restoration sites before using turf transplants in road and infrastructure restoration. Of particular importance is ensuring soil organic content and a fine soil grain size to increase rates of vegetation recovery in short time scales. Time is the most important factor for recovery in this ecosystem, and this should be communicated to project owners and to the public to ensure realistic expectations on recovery time."	14	0	0	0	11	0	14	2018-11-27	WOS:000450061000006	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

If so, which type of seed bank (transient or persistent) can be expected? (b) Do EGR characteristics, such as roof age and substrate depth, influence seed bank seed density and species richness? (c) Can differences in successional stages be noticed in the seed bank and vegetation on EGRs?LocationFlanders and Brussels regions of Belgium.MethodsWe conducted a field sampling campaign in which the vegetation and seed bank of 109 EGRs were sampled. Information on roof characteristics (e.g. age, substrate depth) was also collected. Seedling emergence was monitored under standardized greenhouse conditions. Species traits were collected from several existing databases. Data analysis consisted of (generalized) linear mixed modelling.ResultsA total of 18,466 seedlings from 139 different species emerged in the seed bank analysis. Average similarity between vegetation and the seed bank was low, and the majority of species could be considered spontaneous colonizers. Most species were classified as having a transient seed bank. Life forms were shown to be significantly different between vegetation and seed bank. Older EGRs had higher seed bank species richness and seed density, both of which were also positively influenced by sampling date and the vegetation species richness. A discrepancy between seed bank and vegetation successional state, characterized by functional signatures, was present for EGRs.ConclusionsEGRs do develop seed banks and show parallels with seed banks in other novel ecosystems. Seed bank species richness and seed density are influenced by temporal and vegetation related factors. We can also confirm EGR seed bank succession and the discrepancy between seed bank and vegetation successional state, as often observed in natural and novel systems. Furthermore, we argue that seed banks can function as biodiversity reservoirs, which can be considered in EGR vegetation restoration if a set of several conditions is fulfilled. Overall, this study explores seed bank analysis on EGR as a novel ecosystem model. It thereby provides multiple insights in processes impacting EGR plant species diversity, both on and in the soil."	17	0	0	0	18	0	21	2018-12-28	WOS:000442660900007	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A priori species composition of the driftline was analysed in a greenhouse germination study. Target species were assigned to saline and brackish ecological species groups and present and historic regional occurrences. Our procedure for selecting target species resulted in a list of 98 species characteristic of terrestrial salt and brackish ecological species groups.

During the first 4yr, the mean number of target species in the established vegetation of driftline plots was significantly higher than in control plots. When corrected for spontaneous occurrence by natural colonization in control plots, 44% of the target species in the established vegetation of driftline plots during the first 4yr could be attributed to the transferred material.

How can community changes be tracked by a community-specific approach based on community surveys? Do the results of a community-specific approach depend on the grain of the community classification? Locations: Atlantic wet heaths, southwest France. Methods: We studied vegetation change at one site (Cousseau National Nature Reserve, NNR) and within a network of sites on a regional scale using two resurvey approaches: a plot-specific and a community-specific approach based on sets of old (1968-1998) and new (2006-2012) plots. Two correspondence analyses (CAs) were performed and plots were classified into community types (CTs) using hierarchical clustering. Trajectories of quasi-permanent plots were described along identified gradients. Community change within each CT was detected by testing for differences in mean coordinates along CA axes between old and new plots. Several grains of clustering were tested for the communityspecific approach at the regional scale. Results: At the Cousseau NNR site, the plot-specific approach identified the trajectory of each plot along two major ecological gradients, while the communityspecific approach detected a community change for only one out of the three defined CTs. For the regional network of sites, the community-specific approach found several community changes; their strength and direction differed slightly when the CTs were definedmore accurately. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the resurvey strategy influences our ability to detect the degree and characteristics of vegetation changes in time. The plot-specific approach allows detection of species turnover and real trajectories but may over-emphasize community changes. The community-specific approach offers another way to interpret community changes that could be relevant for habitat conservation issues, especially at a regional level. For the community- specific approach, the detection and interpretation of vegetation change is influenced by the grain of community classification."	11	0	0	0	7	0	12	2017-04-26	WOS:000398083700003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Are any of the donors particularly well suited as reference vegetation? Do bare soil treatments give better results than treatments where the soil is covered? What are the probabilities of steering vegetation development towards donor vegetation under the various restoration treatments?Location: Sunnfjord open-air museum in rural, Western Norway.Methods: In a replicated field trial we tested four restoration methods: transferring fresh hay from a local or a distant donor (hay transfer), seeding with a regional species mix, and allowing natural regeneration. We evaluated outcomes by comparing species richness, transfer rates and vegetation dynamics in donor and trial vegetation over four successive years.Results: Our study revealed considerable changes in species composition under all restoration treatments, which decreased over time, indicating decelerating succession rates. Many non-trial grassland species became established, especially after seeding and natural regeneration (bare soil treatments). All trajectories became synchronized from the second year, and by trial end, the restoration treatments converged with respect to species richness and species composition.Conclusion: All restoration treatments gave high resemblance to a specific donor: the local one. Distant hay transfer resulted in larger temporal changes and exemplified a climatic donor-receiver mismatch, while the failure of several seeded species to germinate indicated an ecological mismatch under the seeding treatment. Vigorous germination of non-trial seeds in the two bare soil treatments evened out the initial treatment-related differences. Dispersal from the surrounding area and between treatments may be utilized for restoration purposes, but also limits the potential for restoring a specific species composition. Although we apparently failed to tailor donor species composition to the recipient, we note that the slow dynamics of long-lived grassland species may lead to a different long-term restoration outcome."	15	3	0	0	14	0	20	2015-04-29	WOS:000352131500004	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In functional ecology, plant communities are considered to hold a set of trait attributes reflecting a specific plant strategy adapted to persist in the environment to which they are exposed. In semi-arid grasslands of the Republic of South Africa, we addressed the following questions: how are community-aggregated plant functional traits (CPFT) shaped by grazing gradients; which plant strategies are associated with the response of CPFTs; and are environmental factors, such as soil properties and grazing management, interrelated with the functional response of vegetation to grazing gradients?Location: Semi-arid grasslands close to Thaba Nchu, Free State (Republic of South Africa).Methods: Piosphere transects from a water point into the field were established to portray grazing gradients on two communal grazing areas with continuous grazing and two commercial farms with rotational grazing. Along each transect, six plots (5 x 5 m) were evenly distributed. The trait-transect sampling was applied to record 12 CPFT related to light capture and forage quality. A redundancy analysis was performed to derive relationship between CPFTs, grazing gradients and environmental conditions.Results: Grazing intensity decreased along piosphere transects, from the water point into the field. Most CPFTs responded to this decreasing gradient of grazing intensity and so allowed derivation of trait syndromes that clearly reflect plant strategies of ruderal and competitive vegetation. Close to water points, plants had higher nitrogen concentrations, fewer cell wall components and higher specific leaf area, hence light capture might be faster and more efficient per leaf area and leaf mass. Plant communities exposed to intensive grazing were well adapted to defoliation, trampling and nutrient accumulation through fast growth rates and a quick return strategy.Conclusions: In the sacrifice zone around water points, there is an ecological niche for vegetation communities exhibiting a strategy of fast growth, which is well adapted to intense and frequent grazing and is also associated with forage of high nutritional quality."	53	6	0	0	36	1	60	2014-07-16	WOS:000337725300010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The New Caledonian mixed rain forest studied was characterized as having high stem density, basal area and species richness, and many small stems (60% of the trees <10 cm DBH and almost a quarter of species did not exceed this threshold). More than one-third of the species were rare (i.e. inventoried in less than three plots or represented by fewer than three individuals) in the plot network and floristic dissimilarity was high (Bray-Curtis index >0.70). The presence of ultramafic (UM) and non-ultramafic substrates (non-UM) combined with altitudinal and rainfall gradients were the main drivers of floristic dissimilarity, whereas the effect of geographic distance between the plots was surprisingly low. Floristic dissimilarity was very high between UM and non-UM substrates from species up to family level. About 75% of the species occurred on a single substrate type. The mixed rain forest on UM and non-UM substrates differed in floristic composition but not in structure.Conclusions: NC-PIPPN proved to be an effective tool for investigating the woody species richness of New Caledonia as containing ca. 46% of its non-herbaceous species. However, the network's design, and more specifically its small plots, restricts its capacity to capture beta diversity and forest structure. High species richness and floristic dissimilarity confirm that New Caledonian mixed rain forest is exceptionally rich."	54	0	0	0	51	1	56	2014-07-01	WOS:000337725300003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The impact of restoration management (mulching for first 5 yrs, mowing in Jul with hay removal in consecutive years) on vegetation diversity in different meadow types was estimated using general linear models, changes in plant community composition were described by NMDS ordination, multiple permutation tests and Indicator species analysis.Results: Restoration management resulted in an increase in species richness on mesic meadows in one of the study sites, and caused a decrease in spatial species turnover and significant changes in community composition in all sites. The effects of restoration on species composition were greater in drier, more elevated mesic meadows, and least prominent in tall sedge meadows in floodplain depressions. Indicator species analysis revealed Ranunculus auricomus as a common indicator of management in mesic and wet meadows, and Carex cespitosa and Calamagrostis canescens as indicators of abandonment in wet and tall sedge meadows, respectively.Conclusions: Restoration management was successful on flooded meadows that had been abandoned for 15-20 yrs, where water regime and soil fertility have not been altered by human activities, and where the local species pool is still available. The current community composition under different management regimes made it possible to propose several species as management status indicators, which may further be used in practical decision-making when evaluating the status of meadow communities."	19	1	0	0	14	0	22	2012-04-01	WOS:000301047300008	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In the transect study, the establishment of C. introflexus and lichens was measured in pure mats of Polytrichum piliferum, an early succession stage. The overall presence of C. introflexus in the area was also estimated. In the dispersal experiment, fragments of C. introflexus and lichen species were sown in P. piliferum mats at two sites with high and low N deposition. In the culture experiment C. introflexus fragments were grown on soil with different carbon (C) content and N dose.Results: The Campylopus: lichen ratio was positively correlated (r(2) = 0.61) with the atmospheric ammonia concentration. Campylopus began to dominate at an ammonia air concentration of 7 mu g m(-3), correlated with the overall presence of the species in the sites investigated. Survival of sown Campylopus fragments was significantly higher and the endangered lichen Cladonia strepsilis significantly lower in the site with a high ammonia concentration. Survival of Cladonia coccifera and Cladonia portentosa was high at both sites. Experimental growing of C. introflexus showed significant responses to both C content and N, although C content showed the strongest effect.Conclusions: Growth of C. introflexus is affected by soil C content and N deposition.

Do fires in different seasons alter the direction of change in grass composition?Location: Texas, USA.Methods: We quantified short-and long-term (12 yr post-fire) herbaceous functional group cover and diversity responses to replicated seasonal fire treatments: (1) repeated-winter fires (three in 5 yr), (2) repeated-summer fires (two in 3 yr), and (3) alternate-season fires (two winter and one summer in 4 yr), compared with a no-fire control.Results: Summer fires were more intense than winter fires, but all fire treatments temporarily decreased Prosopis and C-3 annual grass cover. The alternate-season fire treatment caused a long-term increase in C-4 mid-grass cover and functional group diversity. The repeated-summer fire treatment increased C-4 short-grass cover but also caused a long-term increase in bare ground. The repeated winter fire treatment had no long-term effects on perennial grass cover. Mesquite post-fire regrowth had increasingly negative impacts on herbaceous cover in all fire treatments.Conclusions: Summer fire was necessary to shift herbaceous composition toward C-4 mid-grasses. However, the repeated-summer fire treatment may have been too extreme and caused post-fire herbaceous composition to over-shift toward less productive C-4 short-grasses rather than C-4 mid-grasses.

Higher species richness was recorded in cut treatments compared to the control, but no effects of cutting frequency or liming were observed. Ellenberg indicator values indicated that soil nutrients influenced changes in species composition only marginally.ConclusionsThe decrease in productivity and available soil P and K in favor of species richness was not achieved to any greater extent by four cuts than by two cuts, or by lime application.

How are these change related to the abandonment of traditional coppice-with-standards forest management and increased soil acidification?Location: Central Belgium (Europe).Methods: Twenty semi-permanent phytosociological quadrats from an ancient deciduous forest (Meerdaal forest) were carefully selected out of a total of 70 plots dating from 1954 and were revisited in 2000. Species composition and soil pH H2O were recorded using an analogous methodology. The studied period coincides with a period of forest conversion from coppice-with-standards towards a high forest structure and with an increase in acidifying and eutrophying deposition.Results: Between 1954 and 2000, species composition of the herb layer changed significantly. Redundancy analysis pointed to increased shade resulting from shifts in cover and species composition of the shrub and tree layer as the main driving force. Soil acidity increased and the majority of plots entered the aluminium buffer range, which potentially affected herb layer composition. Observations at the species level, especially a strong decrease in cover of the vernal species Anemone nemorosa supported this hypothesis.Conclusions: Our results show significant shifts in the forest herb layer in less than five decades. These shifts were related to an alteration in the traditional forest management regime and increased soil acidity.

The treatments comprised disturbance (rotavation and trampling by animals), addition of Calluna seed, and three different grazing regimes, together with a no grazing control.Results: The creation of bare ground and addition of seed increased the establishment of the desired dominant shrub, Calluna vulgaris. In the Nardus sward, rotavation and trampling were equally Successful in establishing Calluna, but rotavation was more successful in the Molinia sward. Rotavation inhibited the growth of competitive grass species better than trampling. However, the disturbance techniques were detrimental to other components of the plant community, causing a decline in the cover of desirable species Such as Vaccinium myrtillus and other dwarf shrub species and a small increase in the Occurrence of undesirable species such as Juncus effusus.

Several herbivores were examined after transport between different nature reserves as part of the seasonal grazing system in Flanders, allowing detection of seed dispersal both within and between reserves. The seedling emergence method was used to identify the dispersed plant species.Results: In total. 6385 epizoochorous seeds from 75 species germinated, yet the real seed quantity was underestimated by the seedling emergence method.

Accessible areas are being used more and more intensively, while poorly accessible areas are being abandoned or used as pasture.(2) Current vegetation is highly determined by current land use. Particular vegetation units can be assigned to each form of land use.(3) Succession starts immediately after abandonment.

A primary management question is whether active intervention is required or spontaneous secondary succession could suffice. We studied 54 old-fields in central Hungary, which differed in time since abandonment but which had similar environmental conditions and management histories. The sites were grouped into four age groups according to the time elapsed since cultivation abandonment: 1-5, 6-10, 11-23 and 24-33 yr. In each old-field we recorded the species and estimated their abundances. We grouped species in two ways: according to life form (annuals, biennials, perennials, woody plants) and according to coenological behaviour (weeds, sand and steppe generalists, specialists). We analysed the changes in species number and abundance in these categories as a function of site age.Contrary to other successional studies, the total number of species did not change significantly among the four age groups. A significant chan-c was detected between the first two age groups as to life-form composition. Species number and abundance dance of annuals decreased, while the perennials and woody plants increased. As to coenological behaviour, species number changed only in the first two age groups, while abundance changed in the first three. Weeds quickly disappeared and specialists established and spread, while the species number and abundance of generalists did not change significantly. We concluded that the basic shifts in species composition are almost completed within 10 yr. Most of the late successional species colonized and weeds disappeared. We conclude that there was no need for active intervention in this system: the spontaneous secondary succession leads to semi-natural vegetation."	62	1	0	0	59	0	74	2001-06-01	WOS:000174290900008	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A multidisciplinary evaluation of restoration measures in a degraded Cirsio-Molinietum fen meadow	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	1	1	NA	NA	115	130	NA	10.2307/1479090	Article	MAY 1998	1998	". An integrated multidisciplinary approach including descriptive and experimental research of environmental and biotic factors was used to evaluate an attempt to restore a species-rich fen meadow, phytosociologically belonging to the Cirsio-Molinietum. Expert judgement and preliminary research indicated that soil acidification, due to drainage in the surrounding area, caused the degeneration of the fen meadow. Flooding the meadow with surface water was applied in order to stop acidification. A small irrigated wetland (helophyte filter) was constructed to reduce nutrient availability in the surface water. Sod cutting was applied in a small area as well. The two measures were evaluated through: (1) measurements of hydrological and soil factors, (2) seed bank analysis, (3) recording species composition in permanent plots, (4) assessing the type and extent of nutrient limitation using a full-factorial fertilization experiment, (5) assessing the effect of liming on vegetation biomass, and (6) recording the growth of three introduced fen meadow species in the liming experiment. The research was carried out in a degraded site with intact vegetation, a degraded site where the top soil was removed by sod cutting and a reference site with intact Cirsio-Molinietum vegetation. Groundwater levels in the degraded and the stripped site differed slightly from those of the reference site but they were within the range of Cirsio-Molinietum requirements. Groundwater quality slightly improved in the stripped site. Top-soil removal considerably reduced the macro-nutrient contents and caused a stronger P-deficiency. No increase in soil pH was observed immediately after top-soil removal. A small increase in soil pH was found after five years in the stripped site, indicating a slight recovery from acidification. Liming after top-soil removal had little effect on the soil pH after six months but stimulated the growth of established species such as Agrostis canina. Few viable seeds of characteristic fen meadow species were present in the seed banks of both degraded and well developed fen meadow sites. The species composition after top soil removal reflected the seed bank of the degraded fen meadow and establishment of characteristic fen meadow species was poor, even after five years. The introduced species (Carex hostiana, C. panicea, Cirsium dissectum) survived during the first year in both the degraded and the stripped site. Liming initially stimulated the growth of two species, but in the second year this effect disappeared. After two years, none of the introduced species survived at the stripped site. The restoration measures failed so far, probably because acidification could not be counteracted satisfactorily. Finally, it was concluded that our multidisciplinary approach enables us to draw proper conclusions and that it is suitable for other restoration attempts as well."	44	0	0	0	22	0	48	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800013	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We here adopted a trait-based approach to investigate the effects of macro-and microclimatic gradients on the juvenile plant communities from the realized seed bank of two types of European temperate forest.Location: Oak-dominated forests in Italy and Belgium.Methods: We analysed the variation of key functional traits (plant height, leaf area, leaf dry weight, specific leaf area and leaf number) of juvenile plants from the realised soil seed bank in relation to elevation (from 0 to 800 m a. s.l.), forest type (thinned and unthinned forest) and distance to the forest edge. We translocated soil samples from the forest core to the edge (and vice versa) and from high-to low-elevation forests to test the effects of edge and warming respectively.Results: Taller communities developed at the forest edge due to higher light availability and warmer temperatures. The translocation from the core to the edge did not significantly modify mean trait values. Instead, the shadier and cooler microclimate of the forest core reduced the mean leaf area, mean dry weight, height and leaf number in the communities realised from the edge soil. The translocation from high-to lowland forests led to increased values for all traits (except specific leaf area). Edge vs core trait variation was more driven by intraspecific variability, whereas the translocation from high-to low-elevation forests caused trait changes mostly due to species turnover.Conclusions: Global warming might result in a functional shift of the understorey due to both an early filtering effect on the seedlings from soil seed banks and their adaptive trait adjustments to temperature increase. Furthermore, our study underpins the importance of edge vs core microclimate in driving the functional composition of the realised soil seed bank."	3	1	0	0	2	0	4	2023-08-21	WOS:001036898500001	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

And what are the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in plant community structure and functions between mowed and unmowed grasslands?Location A semi-arid grassland in Jilin Province, northeastern China.Methods In a 30-year experiment, we investigated long-term effects of mowing on the grassland ecosystem in northeastern China by comparing plant community diversity, biomass, and composition between mowed and unmowed permanent plots across six grasslands.Results Long-term mowing did not affect plant species richness, but increased species evenness by 29%. Mowing had little effects on above-ground (shoot) and below-ground (root) biomass. The unchanged above-ground biomass in the mowed areas was attributed to a trade-off between biomass of grasses and forbs: mowing significantly increased forb biomass by 50%, but reduced grass biomass by 20% and the grass to forb biomass ratio by 46%. Mowing also reduced biomass of the dominant Leymus chinensis grass by 24% and litter biomass by 56%. Regression analyses indicated that the species evenness was negatively affected by L. chinensis biomass and litter biomass.Conclusions This study demonstrates that, although long-term moderate mowing has limited effects on plant species richness and plant biomass, such a managed strategy can greatly reduce the dominance of grass species and allow the growth of forb species, leading to a higher species evenness in the plant community. This win-win situation promotes forage production for farmers while increasing plant diversity for conservation, suggesting that current mowing tactics can be a sustainable management practice in this ecosystem. However, the continuous loss of plant litter because of mowing may have negative influences on soil nutrient availability in the long run. From this perspective, a short-term halt in mowing or fertilization that allows plants and soil nutrients to recover could represent a more optimal protocol for management."	12	3	0	0	10	0	16	2023-08-21	WOS:001043558500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, it has hardly been tested whether local seed mixtures can actually be applied successfully in grassland restoration practice at larger scales and long-term. To close this gap, we report the results of a large-scale restoration study in which grasslands were restored about 15 years ago using different local seed mixtures. Location Bavaria, SE Germany. Methods To evaluate the efficacy of the local seed mixtures, we compared the species composition of seed mixtures and current vegetation. We then tested whether restoration success depends on site characteristics such as the size and shape (rectangle or stripe) of the grassland, restoration procedures such as topsoil removal, seed density and land use, or species habitat preferences for light, water and nutrients, and species life span (annual, perennial). Results On average, the current vegetation contained 62.4% of all species that were present in the local seed mixtures. Species from the local seed mixtures made up on average 69.1% of the total cover in the established vegetation, whereby the species composition of the local seed mixture and vegetation differed significantly from each other. The probability that a sown species would establish increased with seed density up to 300 seeds/m(2). Furthermore, habitat preferences significantly affected species establishment chances, with species requiring full illumination, dry and nutrient-poor soil being more successful during restoration, reflecting the high proportion of sites with topsoil removal prior to seeding in our study. Annual species had significantly lower establishment chances compared with their perennial counterparts. Conclusions Our study provides another piece of evidence that local seed mixtures can be applied successfully in large-scale grassland restoration projects. We provide several practical recommendations of how such practices can be further improved by using specific seed densities and creating new local seed mixtures using species that are ecologically more suitable to the restored sites."	15	0	0	0	10	0	15	2022-04-13	WOS:000777971200001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, few studies have explored their effects on beta diversity. Here, we aimed to answer two questions based on woody species composition in a number of geographical administrative divisions: (1) how does beta diversity change with socioeconomic and environmental factors; and (2) what is the relative importance of socioeconomic and environmental factors in driving beta diversity of woody species? Location Eastern China. Methods We used abundance-based beta diversity (Bray-Curtis) and species accumulation rate to quantify beta diversity of woody species of 20 counties in eastern China. Linear regression models were used to test the relationships between beta diversity and socioeconomic and environmental factors. The relative importance of socioeconomic and environmental factors in driving beta diversity was investigated using the variation partitioning method. Results We found that elevation, annual precipitation, and location significantly affected species composition. Species accumulation rate increased significantly with Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GDP per capita and human population density, and decreased with forest cover, topographic and climatic heterogeneity. In addition, abundance-based beta diversity increased significantly with human population density. Moreover, socioeconomic factors, topographic and climatic heterogeneity independently explained 25%, 15%, and 1% of abundance-based beta diversity separately. Conclusion Socioeconomic factors may have significant effects on beta diversity patterns of woody plants. Our study highlights the urgent need to consider socioeconomic factors when exploring large-scale biodiversity patterns in human-dominated landscapes and formulating related forest management strategies."	4	0	0	0	4	0	4	2022-04-02	WOS:000772347500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We analyzed the spatial pattern of 196 samples at different scales and directions with geostatistical analysis. The relationship between above-ground vegetation and SSB was quantified by integrating geostatistics, point pattern analysis, and spatial comparison (IGPS).ResultsThe SSB density in the study area was 404.5 352 seeds.m(-2). SSBs of shrub species and herbaceous species ? (occurring only below-ground) had a moderate spatial autocorrelation, and their spatial dependence increased with increasing scale. The SSB of herbaceous species ? (occurring both above-ground and below-ground) had great spatial autocorrelation, and its spatial dependence showed an initial decrease and then increased. Furthermore, SSBs showed lower spatial heterogeneity in the prevailing wind direction than in other directions. The spatial patterns of SSBs of shrub species and herbaceous species ? correlated with shrubs within a specific range, but not with herbs, while the SSB of herbaceous species ? did not have a spatial relationship with above-ground vegetation.ConclusionThe spatial pattern of SSBs had scale dependence features, which exhibited clustered distribution at a certain scale, and were significantly correlated with above-ground shrubs. Therefore, we suggest subsampling larger quadrats with smaller sample units near shrubs in desert areas. Our workflow seems efficient for determining the spatial pattern of SSBs at medium small scale in arid areas."	9	0	0	0	6	0	9	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800005	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Large numbers of forest visitors can cause severe damage to forest ecosystems, which in turn can affect the ecosystem functioning. We aimed to assess whether experimental short-term and long-term trampling affect the ground vegetation in deciduous forests and its recovery to a different extent. Location Beech forests in northwestern Switzerland. Methods We used a standard experimental trampling procedure to simulate single and repeated human trampling events of different intensity. Experimental trampling of different intensity was conducted on a single day (single trampling) or on five days at intervals of four weeks (repeated trampling) in three suburban beech forests on different soil types. We recorded the cover, height, species density and species composition of the ground vegetation in the trampling lanes. We also assessed the recovery of the ground vegetation one and two years after trampling. Results Trampling intensity and the type of trampling (single vs repeated) affected the ground vegetation in the three forests. Vegetation cover, plant height and species density all decreased with increasing trampling intensity, but to a different extent in the three forests. Most vegetation characteristics were more severely affected by repeated trampling than single trampling of equal intensity. A longer trampling period strengthened the effects of trampling on ground vegetation, except in one forest. Two years after experimental trampling, most vegetation characteristics still differed from those of undisturbed ground vegetation. Conclusion Our study revealed that both trampling intensity and the temporal distribution of trampling influenced the ground vegetation in temperate forests. We provide evidence that the temporal distribution of human trampling events is an important factor, which has to be considered in management decisions for natural beech forests."	7	0	0	0	6	0	7	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900017	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

While several studies have addressed the general impact of different grazing and light intensities on temperate forest ecosystems, little is known about how the combination of these two factors can affect the species pool and functional diversity of temperate forests. Location Oriental beech forests of northern Iran. Methods Vegetation and environmental data of 104 releves were collected. These were assigned to four groups based on their light and grazing intensities. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to analyze vegetation compositional relationships among groups. We used nine functional traits related to growth, reproduction, and survival for a total of 147 plant species. Redundancy analysis of community-weighted means was used to determine the response of single traits to disturbance and environmental variables. Generalized additive models were applied to examine the shape of the response pattern of community-weighted mean trait values across the grazing and light intensity gradients. Functional richness and functional divergence indices were used to analyze functional diversity-disturbance relationships. Results Both light and grazing intensities significantly affected species pools, single traits, and functional divergence. Suites of trait attributes including hemicryptophytes, therophytes, grass-like, hygromorphic leaves, insect-pollinated, rhizomes, and runner plants were associated with high-light sites. In closed-canopy sites the strong filtering effect of shade resulted in suites of trait attributes including taller plants, macrophanerophytes, scleromorphic leaves, simple leaves, and berry fruits. While high-light sites had a larger species pool, they exhibited less functional diversity. Cattle grazing can mediate the filtering effect of light and increase functional diversity in both low-light and high-light sites. Conclusion Conservation measures in this region should acknowledge that moderate traditional cattle grazing combined with individual-tree and group-tree selection in these forests may maintain or even enhance functional diversity in these valuable ecosystems."	9	0	0	0	9	0	9	2021-07-01	WOS:000701239900010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The role of agroforests regarding conservation may be strongly influenced by land-use history; however, few studies have explicitly investigated this. We therefore tested the importance of land-use history for habitat structure and tree diversity in vanilla agroforests situated in a human-modified tropical landscape.Location Smallholder mosaic landscape of northeastern Madagascar.Methods We studied tree stand structure, diversity and composition in vanilla agroforests of contrasting land-use history, old-growth forests, forest fragments and woody fallows after slash-and-burn agriculture, which all contribute to the smallholder mosaic landscape of northeastern Madagascar. The vanilla agroforests were either derived directly from forest or otherwise from woody fallows after slash-and-burn agriculture.Results Land-use history strongly influenced tree species diversity and composition in vanilla agroforests and also affected stand structure. Forest-derived agroforests maintained high levels of tree species diversity and differed in community composition from fallow-derived agroforests, which had relatively low levels of tree diversity. Additionally, forest-derived vanilla agroforests harboured a significantly higher percentage of endemic species than fallow-derived agroforests, and forest-derived agroforests also shared many species with old-growth forests and forest fragments. Fallow-derived vanilla agroforests harboured a lower percentage of endemic species than woody fallows.Conclusion Considering the land-use history of agroforests is important to unfold their full potential as elements in a multifunctional human-modified landscape. Forest-derived agroforests are an alternative to forest conversion through slash-and-burn agriculture and have the potential to sustain high levels of species diversity and important habitat structures. In contrast, fallow-derived agroforests regain stand structure on degraded historically forested land and thereby have the potential to increase canopy cover and connectivity at the landscape scale."	28	2	0	0	25	0	31	2021-04-25	WOS:000636291500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We classified the flooding tolerance of 15 native tree species in a nursery-based method to guide species selection for restoring a flooded forest.Location Atlantic Forest, Sao Paulo State, Brazil.Methods We first exposed 15 native tree species typical of flooded forests to four flooding conditions (i.e., normoxia and three increasing hypoxia levels): no flooding, up to the middle of the root system, up to the root collar, and 2 cm above the root collar. After nine months, we evaluated seedling survival, growth (height and stem diameter), and the occurrence of hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots. Seedling survival and growth data were combined to create a flooding tolerance index. Further, we planted the same species in two degraded swampy areas under three soil preparation methods: planting seedlings in regular planting holes, on mounds, and in between furrows. We assessed seedling survival and stem diameter of these seedlings after one year.Results Flooding tolerance index was significantly correlated to the occurrence of hypertrophied lenticels, but not of adventitious roots. Classifying flooding tolerance of tree species was effective in predicting species growth, but not seedling survival, in restoration plantations. Overall, seedling performance in restoration plantations was highly influenced by species identity, but not by soil preparation methods.Conclusions Species selection to improve restoration performance of flooded forests can be guided by simple and fast screenings performed in nurseries before planting. Pioneer trees may facilitate the establishment of species less tolerant to flooding by reducing water saturation of superficial soil layers and enhancing micro-relief heterogeneity by litter deposition. Only a few native species should initially be used in the restoration of flooded forests with high water tables."	4	0	0	0	4	0	4	2020-11-19	WOS:000583211600001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Here, we ask how rotational and continuous grazing influences the composition, diversity, and biomass production of natural grasslands in southern Brazil. Location The study was conducted at four cattle farms within the south Brazilian grassland region (Campos Sulinos), in the upper area of the Camaqua river basin of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods On each farm, grassland that had previously been subjected to continuous grazing (freely grazed by cattle) was divided into two experimental units; one managed by rotational grazing and the other maintained under continuous grazing. In each experimental unit, 14 permanent plots were monitored over six years for species composition and species biomass. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models to evaluate the effects of grazing management strategies on composition dissimilarity, diversity indices, and plant biomass. Results Grasslands under a rotational grazing regime changed steadily over the period of evaluation. Total biomass and species distribution patterns greatly differed from those in plots subjected to continuous grazing, leading to changes in species richness, dominance, and composition, as well as to an increase in overall plant biomass. Conclusions Community changes during the six-year study period as a consequence of the distinct grazing treatments were evident. Grasslands under rotational grazing management benefitted from less selective grazing, enabling a more uniform growth of species within the communities, which in turn were richer at the end of the six-year experiment. In contrast, the proportion of grazing-resistant species or less-consumed species was higher under continuous grazing, where foraging by cattle appears to be more selective. Rotational grazing thus not only leads to higher species richness and diversity, but also to higher primary and, in consequence, secondary productivity."	28	0	0	0	25	4	30	2019-06-06	WOS:000466383400012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

The 110 plots belonged to five phytosociological alliances, two in oligotrophic fens (Caricion davallianae, Caricion fuscae) and three in wet meadows (Calthion, Molinion, Filipendulion). Changes between surveys were assessed with NMDS, and changes in species richness, Simpson diversity, species cover and frequency and the causes of these changes were evaluated by comparing ecological indicator values.ResultsChanges in species composition varied between alliances, with a general trend towards more nutrient-rich flora with less light at ground level. Species diversity declined, with a marked decreasing trend for the typical species of each alliance. These species were partly replaced by species belonging to nitrophilous and mesophilous grasslands. However, no trend towards drier conditions was detected in these wetlands. The largest changes, with an important colonization by nitrophilous species, occurred in the Swiss sites, where grazing was banned 25years ago. As a result of floral shifts, many plots previously belonging to fens or wet mesotrophic meadows shifted to an alliance of the wet meadows, generally Filipendulion. Moreover, communities showed a slight trend towards more thermophilous flora.ConclusionsThe investigated wetlands in the Jura Mountains have suffered mainly from eutrophication due to land-use abandonment and N deposition, with a loss of typical species. Areas with constant land use (grazing or mowing) showed less marked changes in species composition. The most important action to conserve these wetlands is to maintain or reintroduce the traditional practices of extensive mowing and livestock grazing in the wetlands, especially in areas where they were abandoned 25years ago. This previous land-use change was intended to improve fen conservation, but it was obviously the wrong measure for conservation purposes."	18	0	0	0	18	0	19	2018-01-01	WOS:000425120600014	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Are the resulting patterns of species establishment related to differences in functional trait composition?LocationMeerdaal forest, Oud-Heverlee, Belgium.MethodsA 2-yr field experiment on a topsoil-stripped site of 8.5ha was carried out. We manipulated the early arrival of dominant and subordinate species. The dominant species' set consisted of three generalist grass species, and the subordinate species' set consisted of nine species of forbs and graminoids that often occur in nutrient-poor grasslands. After 4wk, we sowed nine target species for ecological restoration. We recorded plant species cover during 2yr. We used repeated measures ANOVA to test for effects of time (2013, 2014) and treatment (dominant, subordinate and control) on plant species richness, evenness, cover, functional diversity and species and trait composition dissimilarity.ResultsBoth dominant and subordinate species successfully suppressed undesirable early colonizing species. Dominants did not exert priority effects on target species. However, subordinate species exerted strong priority effects via niche preemption, and suppressed their establishment of target species.ConclusionsManipulating the arrival order of dominant species has potential as a restoration tool that can allow restoration practitioners to enhance the establishment success of target species for restoration. We suggest that seed mixtures for restoration should contain dominant species, because they will not affect the establishment of subordinate (target) species, but will impede the establishment of unwanted pioneer and ruderal species.

In all paddocks, the plant species composition and cover were identified. Animals were observed for 14 h a day to record their diet. Diet selectivity regarding 17 plant species and type was calculated. For ten plant species, the functional traits, i.e. canopy height, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and nutritive value, were measured. Differences in diet selection by sheep and goats and the drivers of diet selection were assessed.Results: Of a total of 138 plant species recorded in all paddocks, sheep and goats grazed on 136 and 126, respectively. Sheep grazed more selectively on forbs than on grasses and shrubs, whereas goats grazed on forbs preferentially, on shrubs in conformity with supply in the vegetation cover, and avoided grasses. The diet selectivity of both sheep and goats was similar and was positively correlated with a high concentration of N, P, K, Ca and Mg, which were particularly high in the leaves of Prunus spinosa and lowest in Bromus erectus, and negatively correlated with the LDMC and fibre content in grasses.Conclusions: Dry nutrient-poor calcareous grassland in the late season did not offer animals more macronutrients than required for their maintenance. The animals adapted their foraging strategy to select preferentially forbs or woody species particularly rich in P and with a relatively low fibre content, the real indicators of diet selection.

Aim is to understand the legacy effect of former cultivation practices in order to optimize slash-and-burn cultivation.Location: Forest corridor of Fianarantsoa, southeast Madagascar.Methods: We examined three study sites to capture the ecological range in the forest corridor of Fianarantsoa. At each site, we selected formerly hand-cultivated parcels since first forest clearing so as to represent up to four classes of age of abandonment, encompassing forest fallow periods after cultivation of 0-5, 6-10, 11-20 and 21-30 yrs. These parcels served for selection of 50 plots. Interviews were conducted with each farmer to document former cultivation practices of the parcels, and from these, land-use metrics were calculated. Vegetation was surveyed in the plots and soil samples were taken and analysed for chemical and physical properties of the organo-mineral layer (horizon A).Results: We found that soil properties, such as pH, have higher values with an increasing number of cultivation cycles and duration of cultivation, and that this trend is inversely related to exchangeable P. C/N ratio is correlated to age of abandonment, and inversely related to soil N content. With increasing age of abandonment, species richness and diversity increase due mainly to an increase in ligneous species. The number of herbaceous and fern species increases with duration of cultivation and number of cultivation cycles.Conclusion: Historical land use has had a lasting effect on vegetation and even longer-term effect on soils. Different land-use variables explain soil and vegetation characteristics of the current secondary forest. The ability of soils to recover P appears unrelated to abandonment duration, suggesting that longer periods of time are required to recover P fertility, or that secondary vegetation is shifting the pool of nutrients into biomass. Our results point to the need for a management regime that would maintain both scattered trees and patches of a grass layer, since this might be key to promoting both biodiversity and soil restoration."	11	0	0	0	6	0	13	2016-02-03	WOS:000368074600007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Are colonizing species with different life-history traits affected differently by these factors? Is the effect of increased nutrient availability from land-use legacies mediated by the understorey vegetation?LocationNOrholm hede, a 350-ha heathland in southwest Denmark developing naturally after abandonment of traditional agricultural practices in 1895.MethodsUsing 140 plots (0.03ha), we quantified the vegetation structure, soil properties and natural recruitment of tree/shrubs in the heathland. Further, we used high-resolution LiDAR data to classify the vegetation and identify forest patches. In the analysis, we first used a logistic mixed model to test whether colonization of tree and shrub species differed between areas with different land-use history and whether it was influenced by the distance to forest patches and life-history traits (seed mass) of colonizing species. Then, to determine how different factors influence colonization, we explored the direct and indirect relationships among nutrient availability, density of adult trees, canopy cover, cover of Deschampsia flexuosa and the probability of seedling colonization in each plot using a confirmatory multilevel path analysis.ResultsThe probability of seedling colonization for small- and large-seeded species decreased with distance to forest patches. This response was more pronounced at the previously cultivated area. Multilevel path analysis showed that colonizing species with different life-history traits were affected by different factors. Small-seeded species were negatively affected by increased nutrient availability mediated by an increase in the cover of D.flexuosa. This effect was not found for large-seeded species. Moreover, the density of trees/shrubs (>2m) increased the probability of colonization of small-seeded species, whereas higher canopy cover had a positive effect on large-seeded species.ConclusionsOur analyses demonstrate that the interactions between abiotic factors, biotic interactions and life-history traits of colonizing species can lead to distinct patterns of tree colonization. Land-use legacies can have long-lasting, indirect effects on tree colonization by altering the composition of the understorey vegetation, which in turn can delay tree encroachment and slow down the succession from heathland to forest."	11	0	0	0	9	0	11	2015-07-02	WOS:000356007400011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Eight years following a strong disturbance (i.e. quarrying for gravel exploitation during the asphalting of highway MG-010), spontaneous succession did not occur on degraded areas. This study was therefore designed to test the restoration technique of hay transfer as a means of enhancing seed dispersal from the reference ecosystems to the degraded areas.Location: Campo rupestre grasslands, Serra do Cipo, Minas Gerais, Brazil.Methods: Nine degraded areas representing three kinds of substrate (latosol, sandy and stony) were selected. Hay transfer was carried out using hay collected in two kinds of grassland (i.e. campos arenosos and campos pedregosos) year-round in 2010, in order to maximize the seed pool. The collected hay was distributed on 40 cm x 40 cm quadrats among the three types of substrate, with and without geotextile, according to the following protocol: hay from campo arenoso grasslands was spread on all types of substrate, while hay from campo pedregoso grasslands was used on stony substrate only.Results: Few seedlings emerged within 14 mo of the treatment application, despite the large number of seeds contained in the hay, indicating that hay transfer may not be a useful method for restoring degraded areas of campos rupestres. The seedlings emerging on the degraded areas mainly belonged to ruderal species. Therefore, we suggest that, although poor soil conditions could limit seedling establishment, germination issues of the campo rupestre species are the first limitation for restoring degraded campos rupestres using hay transfer.Conclusion: Our results highlight the inherent difficulty in restoring degraded areas of campos rupestres; their protection must be made a high conservation priority."	61	0	0	0	53	5	62	2014-07-01	WOS:000337725300011	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Smoke primer (i.e. fire surrogate) was applied to soil seed bank samples to evaluate fire as a possible management and restoration tool.Results: Abandoned agricultural fields adjacent to renosterveld remnants are characterized by alien grass cover, nutrient enrichment of the soil and depletion of the indigenous soil seed bank. In contrast, pine plantations show less alien species infestation, soil nutrient alteration and have a viable soil seed bank as well as re-development of indigenous renosterveld vegetation after clearance. Seedling recruitment was not significantly influenced by application of a smoke primer compared to the magnitude of fire response in fynbos.Conclusion: Abandoned agricultural fields (previously renosterveld) at Tygerberg have a very low restoration potential.

Location Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Methods Gradients in the cover of exotic plants, as well as the richness of exotic and native vascular species, were examined as a function of distance from anthropogenic forest boundaries and recreational trails. Plants were sampled in 2 m x 10 m and 10 m x 10 m plots distributed among 11 urban forest remnants. Randomization tests were used to quantify the distance of edge influence from both forest boundaries and trails, and to determine if there was an interaction between them. Results The cover and richness of exotic plants and richness of native species decreased with increasing distance from forest boundaries and trails. Edge influences extended to distances of ca. 50 and 3 m for forest boundaries and trails, respectively, and were stronger for measures of understorey than of overstorey vegetation. Vegetation was simultaneously influenced by both edge types such that exotic cover and richness were higher when in close proximity to two edges than when subject to either edge alone (i.e. a positive interaction). Conclusions It is important to consider the influence of edges in the design and management of forest remnants to improve the ability to conserve native biodiversity within cities. Results from this study may be used to guide the design of such systems, particularly by suggesting appropriately sized patches and trail densities."	29	2	0	0	25	0	39	2012-10-03	WOS:000308373500008	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Plant cover on the control microsites was more than twice that on the mounds and tracks. The exotic plants, panic veldt grass (Ehrharta erecta) and kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) were typical indicators of high cattle use sites, while wandering jew (Tradescantia fluminensis) and to a lesser extent the unpalatable, low-sprawling shrub mist-flower (Ageratina riparia) were indicators of low cattle use sites.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that there are few differences in plant community composition between microsites constructed by cattle and those of wombats. Both microsites supported a community that was a subset of the species pool in the surrounding vegetation. Cattle grazing since 1851 in Kangaroo Valley has probably reduced disturbance-sensitive plant species, resulting in an effect that is more apparent at the landscape scale. Further study should focus on the landscape-scale effects of cattle grazing to determine whether cattle or wombats are the major causes of ecosystem degradation in Australian riparian environments."	4	0	0	0	1	0	5	2012-02-16	WOS:000299207600007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

A field survey was conducted to examine the relationship between light availability and canopy type (open pasture, planted canopy and secondary forest) on understory grass biomass and litter accumulation. We then experimentally manipulated light levels to determine the effect of light availability on growth and survival of six native woody species and three alien grasses. Low-light (5%), medium-light (10%) and high-light (20-30%) treatments were created using shade structures erected beneath the existing secondary koa canopy.ResultsIn the field survey, alien grass biomass was greatest under the open pasture and lowest in the secondary forest. There was a positive correlation between understory light availability and alien grass biomass. In the experimental study, large reductions in relative growth rates were documented for all of the grass species and four of the six woody species under the lowest light level. Although growth at 5% light is substantially reduced, survival is still high (84-100%), indicating that these species may persist under closed canopy.ConclusionLow-light conditions result in the greatest reduction in alien grass biomass while creating an environment in which native woody species can grow and survive."	37	1	0	0	31	0	50	2010-08-01	WOS:000279438400003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The fire chronology began under presettlement conditions following aboriginal depopulation. Subsequent land uses included European settlement, iron mining, logging, and US Forest Service acquisition and fire protection.Results: Fires occurred approximately every 5 years until 1930 without any evidence of a temporal trend in fire frequency. Burning ceased after 1930. Area-wide fires affecting multiple pine stands were common, occurring at intervals of approximately 16 years. Most living pines became established during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Dead pines indicated that an older cohort established ca. 1730. Most hardwoods were established between the 1920s and 1940s.Conclusions: Except for fire protection, changes in land use had no discernible influence on fire frequency. Lightning ignitions and/or large fire extent may have been important for maintaining frequent burning in the 1700s, while fuel recovery may have constrained fire frequency during later periods. The disturbance regime appears to be characterized by frequent surface fires and occasional severe fires, insect outbreaks or other disturbances followed by pine recruitment episodes. Industrial disturbances appear to have had little influence on the pine stands. The greatest impact of industrial society is fire exclusion, which permitted hardwood establishment."	58	0	0	0	45	0	67	2010-02-01	WOS:000273601700004	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The fertilization regime was stopped in 1989. Phytosociological releves of 2 m x 4 m in size were made in 1990, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2003 and 2006. The data were processed by multivariate ordination methods (DCA, CCA). Differences in the number of species per plot were tested by repeated measures anova and Tukey's HSD test.ResultsAll plots, including controls, exhibited a distinct trajectory through time, reflecting the rates of fertilizer used and generally changing in the same direction. Both time and nutrients significantly influenced the vegetation pattern. Treatments differed significantly in species richness, especially at the beginning of the observation. Differences in later years were less pronounced, thus a convergence between the treatments was evident.ConclusionsDuring the 16 years after fertilization ceased, the number of species substantially increased not only in the fertilized plots but also in the controls. Species typical of semi-natural grasslands predominantly contributed to the increase. Spontaneous recovery after cessation of fertilizing was relatively efficient, but the fertilized plots were small in size and thus rather easily colonized from outside.

In addition, records from available databases were used for missing data. Multivariate methods were used to characterize the vegetation and seed production. Communities were grouped according to level of disturbance and tested for differences in seed production. Similarity between vegetation composition and seed profile was examined using the Sorensen index and Spearman correlation coefficient.Results: It was found that the seed production of the studied communities is large, variable and in general increasing with disturbance intensity.

The structure of dune ponds hygrophytic vegetation has a spatial organisation in belts around the pond basin, closely related to water level and flooding regime. Donana National Park has an important representation of temporal dune ponds, which are subjected to rainfall fluctuations and may be suffering the impact of water extraction from the neighbouring tourist resort. Permanent transects in a vegetation complex of five dune ponds have been monitored during a eight year period (1990-1997). This period was characterised by a number of dry years (annual rainfall around 300 mm), located between two wet cycles (800-900 mm). Transects were analysed in 1990 (wet period), 1994 (dry) and 1997 (wet) by hierarchical agglomera-tive clustering. During the dry period hygrophytic species showed regression, with a high mortality of some species like Ulex minor, while the xerophytic species advanced to lower areas. Seedlings of some xerophytic species colonised the dry surface of the pond basin. The lowering of the water table varied in the different ponds, ranging from 312 to 190 cm depending on topography and the distance to the pumping area. The new period of flooding during 1995-96 and 1996-97 cycles provided the opportunity for hygrophytic spe cies to re-establish themselves in their original places. This study suggest that changes in vegetation are caused by the interaction between weather conditions and human disturbance (water extractions). In our example man-made disturbance is more marked during the dry periods while wet periods tend to obscure the effects of water extractions. From a management perspective, long-term monitoring of water table and vegetation structure is revealed as a key procedure to the management of land-water ecotones on pressured areas and threatened habitats."	26	0	0	0	20	0	32	1998-05-01	WOS:000208471800016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location The mainland of Norway. Methods We utilized data from the Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Agricultural Landscapes, which recorded vascular plants from 569 plots, placed within 97 monitoring squares systematically distributed throughout agricultural land on the Norwegian mainland. We identified four grassland types: (i) moderately fertilized, moist meadows; (ii) overgrown agricultural land; (iii) cultivated pastures and disturbed ground; and (iv) natural/unfertilized and outfield pastures. Results Soil moisture and grazing measures were found to be important in explaining species compositional variation in all grassland types. Richness patterns were best explained by complex and differing combinations of environmental indicators. Nevertheless, negative (nitrogen and light level) or unimodal (pH) responses were similar across grassland types. Vegetation plots adjacent to areas historically and/or currently dominated by mires, forests, or pastures, as well as abandoned and overgrown grasslands, had a slightly higher species richness. Larger grasslands surrounding the vegetation plots had slightly less species than smaller grasslands. Conclusions This study demonstrates that data from a national monitoring programme on agricultural grasslands can be used for plant ecological research. The results indicate that climate-change-related shifts along moisture and nutrient gradients (increases) may alter both species composition and species richness in the studied grasslands. It is likely that large and contiguous managed (grass)land might affect areas perceived as remnants, probably caused by the transformation to homogeneous (agri)cultural landscapes reducing edge zones, which in turn may threaten the species pool and richness. The importance of land use and land-cover composition should be considered when planning management actions in extensively used high-latitude grasslands."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2022-04-01	WOS:000772168000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Vegetation plots, recording the presence or abundance of all plant species co-occurring within a plot, are currently used to identify terrestrial Natura 2000 habitat types, whose descriptions are mainly based on phytosociological units. However, vegetation plots are time-consuming and frequently restricted to the growing season. Moreover, no vegetation plots can be regarded as exhaustive, and significant inter-observer variation has been highlighted. We studied whether reducing the number of recorded species and the time spent carrying out a vegetation plot had an impact on vegetation unit assignment using species presence. We also studied if vegetation plots recorded in winter could be used for vegetation unit assignment. Location Mainland France. Methods We used 273 vegetation plots covering French temperate and mountainous forests. The time at which species were sighted was recorded. We also estimated whether a species was recognisable in winter. We used a classification program to compare assignments based on complete and incomplete vegetation plots. Results Ten species and five minutes were sufficient to assign a plot to an association, and to an alliance, seven species and four minutes. Vegetation unit assignment proved feasible in winter, especially at the alliance level. Conclusions We confirmed that a limited number of species is sufficient to assign vegetation plots to vegetation units. However, mapping habitats requires habitat identification and delimitation. This study confirms current field habits, particularly when creating a habitat map, usually based on a limited number of recorded species. Lastly, it confirms that the use of vegetation plots coming from a great variety of sources is relevant to create habitat time series, crucial tools for monitoring habitats at a national scale."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2022-04-02	WOS:000772311000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Among the three land uses, we compared 12 plant community variables, categorized into four groups characterizing different sets of community properties (structure, diversity, composition, and conservation values).ResultsA multivariate combination of the 12 community variables differed among all three land uses, each of the four categories of variables differed between at least two land uses, and eight of 12 individual variables differed between at least two land uses. Community structure displayed a gradient of decreasing tree canopy and understorey plant cover and increasing lichen-moss cover from continuously forested to unburned and burned formerly cultivated sites. Understorey plant species richness did not vary with land use, but species diversity was higher on cultivated sites, irrespective of fire history. While all three land uses now contain Quercus tree overstories, each land use exhibited unique understorey species composition. Only formerly cultivated sites contained state-listed endangered species. Cultivated sites had a lower proportion of native species cover than did continuously forested sites, but native species still comprised over 90% of the plant cover on cultivated sites. Compared with continuous forests, the soil organic layer (O horizon) was five times thinner and loss on ignition in the 0-15 cm mineral soil 49% (unburned) and 66% (burned) lower on previously cultivated sites.ConclusionsCommunity characteristics varied in their sensitivity to land use history, with species composition among the most sensitive to prior land use. A dense sapling layer of Acer rubrum forming in long-unburned Quercus forests across much of eastern North America was absent in our study on formerly cultivated sites, possibly due to dry, infertile soil. From a restoration and conservation standpoint of the study region's pre-settlement, frequently burned and open savannas and woodlands, previously cultivated sites may be easier to keep open via prescribed fire. Moreover, perhaps precisely because much of the flora historically developed in open savannas and woodlands which previously cultivated sites on the contemporary landscape most closely mimicked, previously cultivated sites presently contain higher species diversity and more conservation priority species than do continuously forested sites."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2022-03-23	WOS:000764249800018	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What is their syntaxonomical position? Can we integrate them into the European vegetation classification system? Which environmental factors are the main drivers of the floristic differentiation of vegetation types? Location Southern and western Turkey. Methods We collected 4,717 vegetation plots of forest and shrubland vegetation in Mediterranean Turkey and performed an unsupervised classification of this data set. We described vegetation types based on the classification results, expert knowledge and information from the literature. We defined diagnostic species and prepared distribution maps for each vegetation type. To support the interpretation of the vegetation types, we determined the most important environmental variables using canonical correspondence analysis. Results The studied vegetation was divided into 21 types related to three vegetation belts: (a) thermo- and meso-mediterranean, comprising coniferous (Pinus brutia, Pinus pinea) and sclerophyllous forests, as well as macchia, garrigue and phrygana; (b) supra-mediterranean, comprising Pinus nigra subsp. pallasiana forests, thermophilous deciduous forests dominated by various oak species and Ostrya carpinifolia, and forests dominated by temperate species such as Fagus orientalis; and (c) oro-mediterranean, comprising forests and shrublands dominated by Abies cilicica, Cedrus libani, Juniperus excelsa and Juniperus communis subsp. nana. Elevation was identified as the main environmental driver of the vegetation pattern. Among climatic variables, the most important are the mean temperatures (annual and of driest, coldest, and warmest quarters), minimum temperature of winter, precipitation of warmest and driest quarters and precipitation seasonality. These factors indicate the decreasing effect of the Mediterranean climate with increasing elevation. Conclusions The vegetation of Mediterranean Turkey is arranged along climatic gradients depending on elevation and the distance from the Mediterranean Sea. Most vegetation types in this area correspond to the syntaxa accepted in EuroVegChecklist, while others were described as new."	15	0	0	0	11	0	19	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

It is distributed throughout upland Europe but overgrazing has contributed to an unfavourable conservation status. To guide tall herb restoration, we asked: (a) Does using grazing exclusion where the tall herb habitat is confined to cliff ledge patches promote an expansion into the grassland below? (b) Does this management negatively affect vascular plant diversity? Location Ben Lawers NNR, Scotland. Methods Large herbivores have been excluded from a 180-ha area containing patches of outcrops rich in tall herb habitat. Using 1999 and 2017 surveys of permanent plot transects located in the grassland below (Before-After design), we quantify impacts on community composition and tall herb abundance. Results Species diversity remained constant although total species richness declined slightly and tall herb species richness increased significantly. There was a large expansion in tall herb cover (+29.67%) and a corresponding decrease in grass cover (-26.16%), as well as smaller increases in bryophytes and small herbs and a reduction in bare ground. Community composition shifted significantly from species typical of upland calcareous grassland towards those found in tall herb habitats. Seven tall herb species were amongst those showing the greatest increase in cover, along with taller grasses and understory herbs. Grazing tolerant grasses and low-growing, prostrate and annual herbs decreased. Competition for light, rather than resilience to herbivory, now has a major influence on the vegetation. Conclusions Using grazing exclusion where the tall herb habitat is largely confined to patches on cliff ledges facilitates an expansion into the upland grassland below. Although this management favours species tolerant of shadier conditions, there is no evidence of a negative impact on vascular plant community composition. It is therefore an effective strategy for promoting the restoration and favourable condition of this grazing-sensitive habitat."	11	0	0	0	11	0	11	2019-06-01	WOS:000473236900003	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

How do management tools and local topographic factors influence themagnitude of recovery? Do effective restoration tools and sites differ depending onmeasurement indices (community-and species-level responses)?Location: Semi-natural grasslands surrounding Mt. Aso, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan.Methods: We conducted vegetation surveys in grassland sites with two land-use forms (continuously managed/restored after abandonment) and two management types (burning only/burning and mowing). We assessed restoration success by examining plant species composition using the similarity index. We also examined the community-level (i.e. species richness) and species-level (i.e. species occurrence) responses to land-use form, management type and local topographic factors (elevation and slope aspect).Results: Reintroduction of grassland management can recover the plant species composition of restored sites. Combined burning and mowing management was a principal determinant of the species richness and occurrence of most grassland species. A north-facing slope was a clear topographic determinant of higher species richness. However, we also found that the presence of some of the grassland's endangered species (i.e. Achillea alpina subsp. subcartilaginea, Artemisia stolonifera and Viola orientalis) was limited in continuously managed sites and that the response to topographic factorswas species-specific.Conclusions: The reintroduction of combined burning and mowing management in various topographic areas is essential for both plant diversity recovery and local endangered species conservation for the restoration of abandoned semi-natural grasslands.

What method results in the most timely and cost-effective means of reinstating biodiversity and restoring ecosystem functions and services?MethodsWe explored the efficacy and costs of two re-vegetation techniques commonly used in ecosystem restoration: direct seeding and planting of seedlings. Our analysis focused on 120 scientific peer-reviewed publications reporting on experiments using seeds or seedlings, and encompassed a range of ecosystems such as wetlands, savannas and forests. We examined current restoration issues, including species diversity, survival, species selection, costs and how future climate change may influence restoration efforts.ResultsDirect seeding experiments used more species than seedling studies, yet showed lower survivorship. Species availability is the major constraint in the selection of which species were used, regardless of the approach employed. Although costs are extremely important when planning a restoration project, few published findings report on the economic aspects of ecosystem restoration. Further, we did not find any study addressing the impacts of global climate change on restoration programmes or how studies should consider future shifts in the environment.ConclusionsOur results highlight the need for restoration experiments to explore more species. Restoration efforts are in need of detailed reporting that includes time frames and costs. We need to consider future climate scenarios that will affect ecosystem restoration efforts."	213	3	0	0	167	15	242	2015-10-01	WOS:000361181500003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Are herbs and shrubs similarly affected? Is the dominance of the main species modified by burning and its timing?LocationLos Puntales, Sierra Morena (Cordoba, southern Spain).MethodsThe shrubland was 12yr old, dominated by several species of Cistus, among the main seeders. Four blocks, each containing plots of 25x25m, were burned in late May (early season, ES) and late September (late season, LS) with similar fire intensity. Woody plant density and woody and herbaceous cover and richness were monitored during the first three post-fire years and compared to pre-fire using ANOVA and ordination techniques.ResultsBurning season did not affect cover of the herbaceous or woody species in general, nor cover of the main groups (monocots, dicots, annuals and perennials) or density of the main woody species 3yr after fire. Fire, however, differentially affected the relative abundance of the main shrub species. Ordination analysis showed that, while succession of herbaceous species was on track to convergence with the pre-fire vegetation, this was not the case for the woody species.ConclusionsBurning season was not a significant factor in altering the post-fire regeneration in this seeder-dominated shrubland. Thus, the temporal window for prescribed fires is large, and both seasons could equally be used for management purposes. However, changes in the relative dominance of species due to fire indicate that managers should be alert when this shrubland burns."	15	2	0	0	15	0	16	2014-11-05	WOS:000342839200012	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To what degree does the share of typical flooded meadow species in the soil seed bank change during secondary succession from traditionally managed hayfields to stages overgrown by woody vegetation?LocationFlooded meadows in Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve, central Estonia (26 degrees 14 ' E, 58 degrees 33 ' N).MethodsThe species composition of above-ground vegetation and the persistent soil seed bank were investigated with PerMANOVA and non-metric multidimensional scaling in mown, 25-yr abandoned and 50-yr abandoned sedge and tall forb meadows subjected to annual flooding. Particular attention was given to typical flooded meadow species in the persistent soil seed bank. General linear models and non-parametric tests were used to assess successional trends in seed bank richness, density, similarity to target vegetation and percentage of flooded meadow species to assess the restoration potential of the soil seed bank.ResultsThe cessation of traditional management has led to considerable changes in both above-ground and seed bank communities, differences between successional stages being more pronounced in the soil seed bank. The density of the seed bank was higher in abandoned meadows. Diversity in the vegetation and soil seed bank was lowest in the 25-yr abandoned tall forb meadows. Although the soil seed bank similarity to above-ground mown meadows (locally defined target vegetation) was relatively low across different successional stages, the proportion of flooded meadow species in the seed bank remained high - even after 50-yr abandonment, on average 42% of emerged seeds from sedge meadow and 34% from tall forb meadow were typical flooded meadow species.ConclusionsAbandoned floodplain meadows in central Estonia still contain a relatively large grassland community species pool, including a large and effective soil seed bank. The soil seed bank could thus play an important role in the restoration of abandoned and overgrown meadow communities.

What are the implications of grazing management for species conservation? Location Pastures dominated by Bromus erectus grazed by either sheep or horses in the Umbria-Marches Apennines (central Italy). Methods We examined grasslands at altitudes ranging from 1000 to 1200 m a.s.l. on north-facing slopes and with a slope angle of 20-40 degrees. In 20 plots of 1 m2 for each management type, canopy height and above-ground phytomass were recorded. In 120 plots (60 for each management type) of 1 m2 the cover value of each species was recorded. Floristic diversity and community similarity of the sheep- and horse-grazed conditions were compared. Functional plant traits and strategies or ecological requirements were also evaluated. Results The sward was shorter and supported less above-ground phytomass in the horse-grazed area. The sheep- and horse-grazed areas had similar floristic diversity. Accidental species were the species most affected. Plants with low-nutrient requirement spread in horse-grazed pasture. Functional traits of species were filtered by the system, resulting in diverse cover values of species. Horse grazing promoted plants with a robust defence strategy (avoidance and tolerance) that ensured leaves were replaced when horses were not grazing, as well as species with clonal growth. In the sheep-grazed area, a higher level of selective defoliation and a delayed start to the grazing period promoted species with low palatability, a late-flowering strategy and those intolerant to trampling by large herbivores (chamaephytes). The value of forage feed was slightly higher in horse-grazed pasture. Grazing of horses was more effective than that of sheep for controlling dominant unpalatable tall grasses. Conclusion In terms of biodiversity conservation, horse grazing may be considered as useful as sheep grazing, but only if managed at optimal stocking rates, because the increase in short grasses and annuals (growth forms with poor root systems) does not ensure maintenance of soil on steep slopes."	37	1	0	0	35	0	43	2012-10-03	WOS:000308373500002	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We tested the response of the diaspore bank using univariate and multivariate analysis of variance. The two approaches were complementary and together improved the interpretation of these results. There were considerable differences in the diaspore banks of the two sites and among the experimental locations within sites. Within each experiment there were differences in species composition, with species that were (1) common to both diaspore bank and vegetation, (2) restricted to the diaspore bank and (3) restricted to the vegetation. There is a possibility of increasing the biodiversity of the developing vegetation if some of the species present in the diaspore bank can be germinated. This was especially true for ferns where four species were found in the spore bank which were not present in the vegetation. There were few significant effects of management treatment on the diaspore bank as the experiments had been in progress for only 3 to 5 yr, but a few species had different densities in the different treatments (Betula pubescens, Juncus effusus and some bryophytes).

The enclosure contained four different plant communities. Eutrophic pastures on deep soil were largely overturned, but recolonization was quick and vegetation dominated by the original species. Mesotrophic pastures were less damaged on stony soil but were completely destroyed on deep soil, recovery was slow and was characterized by a shift of plant species in a more eutrophic direction. Four years were not sufficient for complete recovery. Oligotrophic calcareous pastures on shallow stony soil were not damaged.

Special attention is given to effects on plant species richness and community characteristics that are relevant for lagomorphs (hares and rabbits) and geese. Inundation frequency and grazing were most important in explaining the variation in species abundance data. The three marshes studied overlap in the occurrence of different plant communities and the observed patterns were consistent between them. Clear differences in frequency and abundance of plant species were observed related to grazing. Most plant species had a greater incidence in grazed treatments. Species richness increased with elevation, and was 1.5 to 2 x higher in the grazed salt marsh.

Alvars in the Baltic region, particularly on the Swedish islands of Oland and Gotland and in western Estonia, are well-known for their plant species richness and extensive populations of rare species. Grasslands make up most of alvar vegetation. The extent of these grasslands decreases because of bush enchroachment which takes place in most alvars when traditional land use practice changes, notably when grazing is ceased. The main threat for the alvar grassland is formed by the rapid expansion of Juniperus communis and Potentilla fruticosa in dry and wet sites, respectively. Applied research has been carried out during several years in order to develop plans for the restoration of alvar grassland. Thus it was shown that species richness in areas with a mixture of grassland and shrubland decreases in relation to the increased cover by shrubs. In the case of Juniperus there is a distinct drop in species number as soon as the cover exceeds 75-80%, while the decrease is more gradual with increased cover of Potentilla. The seed banks under dense stands of these shrubs only contain ca. 20% of the species found in dry and wet alvar meadows. This was confirmed by clearing experiments. Long-term recordings have shown that establishment of juniper seedlings takes place mainly in half-open areas between already existing junipers. Intermediate-sized junipers expanded faster than old and big shrubs. Potentilla shrubs recover fast from cutting or burning. After 2-4 yr they have almost attained their former size. This recovery can be prevented when cattle grazing is introduced. In the framework of a local alvar restoration project on Oland, covering 7000 ha, grazing regimes are re-established, fences erected and large-scale clearings carried out. Recently established juniper shrubs are being cleared, intermediate sized junipers (30-50 yr old) are selectively removed while creating a mosaic landscape with high biological diversity. Older dense juniper stands are left alone or are only partly cleared. Potentilla stands in moist areas are cut to create moist meadows which are breeding grounds for waders, and to establish corridors between remaining open areas. Three items are discussed (1) the importance of the Stora Alvar area; (2) re-introduction of grazing and (3) re-introduction of species. The outstanding importance of the area regarding species richness and endemism should be recognized through a golden list to be used along with red and blue lists."	32	4	0	0	31	0	38	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200008	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Immobilization of soil nitrogen as a possible method for the restoration of sandy grassland	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	3	1	NA	NA	7	14	NA	10.2307/1478913	Article	MAY 2000	2000	". Experiments were designed to test the applicability of nitrogen immobilization as a means of accelerating the recovery of an endemic open sandy grassland (Festucetum vaginatae danubiale) on old fields in the Great Hungarian Plain. Effects of various carbon sources (sucrose, starch, cellulose and sawdust) and their combinations in different quantities were studied in laboratory microcosms. Carbon addition decreased nitrogen availability in all cases, the intensity and timing of change being dependent on the type of carbon source applied. The combination of 2 g each of sucrose and polysaccharides (starch, cellulose, sawdust) per kg soil was found to be the most effective, as sucrose decreased available nitrogen content of soil intensively and the polysaccharides maintained the immobilized nitrogen for a longer period. In a follow-up experiment, sucrose and sawdust were selected for field application to test their effectiveness in immobilizing N and accelerating restoration. The field experiment was established to test the importance of abiotic site differences in the immobilization of soil nitrogen. Selected sites were located along an elevation, moisture and productivity gradient. Soil organic matter, microbial biomass-C and decomposition rate varied between sites depending on the elevation gradient. At two sites with lower soil moisture and organic matter levels carbon addition increased microbial activity and nitrogen immobilization significantly."	69	1	0	0	58	0	86	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200002	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In order to define the regeneration niche and then promote the re-introduction of Quercus rugosa into a disturbed area we studied seed predation, germination, seedling survival and growth of this species at three different sites: the forest interior, the forest border and a disturbed site, along a disturbance gradient. Acorn removal on the ground was high at the sites, with higher removal rates from 25-seed clusters than from 5- and 1-seed clusters. More seeds were removed at the forest border than at the other two sites, although in all cases some seeds remained in the soil for periods long enough for them to germinate and produce seedlings. Seed germination and seedling establishment were more successful and similar in the forest interior and the forest border, and much less successful at the disturbed site, due to acorn desiccation. Seedling survival was strongly affected by site, with the highest survival at the forest border and the lowest survival at the disturbed site after a year. The subsequent dry season, which was particularly harsh, caused a drop in survival both at the forest border and the disturbed site. In the former, a closer analysis revealed that partially shaded microsites enhanced survival, while in the latter overall survival was very low, with approximately 5 % of the seedlings surviving, compared to 50 % final survival at the other sites. There was a positive correlation between seed size and seedling survival at the forest border. The three size variables measured (seedling height, basal diameter and crown area) did not increase noticeably during the 20-month study period at the forest interior, while growth still occurred at the forest border and the disturbed site. However, during the two dry seasons there were large drops in mean seedling height and crown area at the disturbed site, due to more frequent dieback, causing large variation in seedling size. These results show that extensive re-introduction of this species to the disturbed area will probably fail under present conditions, and that careful selection or duplication of microsites that mimic the partial shade of the forest border is a sound method for improving oak establishment at this site."	29	1	0	0	17	11	34	1999-12-01	WOS:000208472100004	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Best practices for restoration of these important ecosystems are unknown. Here, we examine the effectiveness of different treatments for restoring native vegetation (plant cover and native species richness) in degraded areas on a mountain summit through an experimental restoration approach.LocationCadillac Mountain, Acadia National Park, Maine, USA.MethodsWe tested six restoration-method treatments: control, planting modules, coir erosion control, seed and coir, soil and coir, and soil, seed, and coir. We established four replicates of each restoration-method treatment in 2016 and monitored percent cover and species richness twice per year from 2017 to 2022. In 2017, we established four more plots for each of three soil-depth treatments (2.5 cm soil, seed, and coir, 13 cm soil and coir, and 13 cm soil, seed, and coir) and monitored percent cover.ResultsSix years after restoration began, native vegetation cover was highest in treatments with added soil. Seeding (502 seeds/m2) had no effect on percent cover. Planting seedlings added vegetative cover initially, but did not increase over time. Cover was equally high in treatments with shallow soil (2.5 cm deep) and deep soil (13 cm deep). Treatments with added soil also had the highest native species richness. Adding a small amount of soil (2.5 cm soil depth) with erosion control (i.e., coir matting) successfully restored vegetation to previously degraded areas of the Cadillac Mountain summit.ConclusionsMountain ecosystems will continue to experience degradation from human recreation and climate change. Restoration of degraded areas is critical to maintain these rare ecosystems. Our results suggest that restoring and maintaining soil is key to restoring degraded areas. However, more research is needed to understand the long-term implications and success of mountain summit restoration. Our study provides an example of how this work can be done without delaying restoration using an experimental restoration approach."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-08-17	WOS:001546241100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Are effects modulated by soil moisture? What are the implications for forest management and nature conservation?Location Broadleaved deciduous low-elevation forests on the southern slope of the Alps across the Swiss-Italian border region.Methods We compared the native herbaceous and woody plant composition, species richness, Shannon diversity and abundance at ten deciduous forest sites on two moisture conditions (six mesic-moist sites and four mesic-dry sites). Each site consisted of three plots measuring 400 m2 along a gradient of T. fortunei presence, ranging from dominant, to present but not dominant to absent.Results In mesic-moist forests with high densities of T. fortunei, species richness and Shannon diversity of native plants and recruiting woody species in the herb and shrub layers were significantly reduced compared to similar sites where T. fortunei is absent or not dominant. However, in mesic-dry forests these variables did not differ between palm-invaded and uninvaded plots. The abundance of recruiting woody individuals did not differ between plots invaded by palms and uninvaded control plots in either forest type.Conclusions We expect detrimental consequences for plant diversity in mesic-moist alluvial forests with high T. fortunei densities and few detrimental consequences in the more widespread non-alluvial forests. We recommend multifaceted management, including targeted eradication in alluvial forests identified as hotspots of native plant diversity, accompanied by hands-off management of T. fortunei in non-alluvial forests, recognizing the ongoing and inevitable laurophyllisation; a biome shift toward mixed-evergreen forest that may increase ecosystem climate resilience under ongoing climatic warming."	6	0	0	0	5	0	6	2024-01-29	WOS:001142560100001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The effects and mechanisms of different grazing seasons on semi-arid steppe vegetation are less explored on the Mongolian Plateau. Therefore, we assessed the impact and underlying mechanisms of grazing seasons on grassland community structure and production. Location: Xilingol, Inner Mongolia, China. Methods: We conducted a three-year experiment to investigate the effects of grazing in four different seasons under the same grazing intensities on plant community structure and production in a typical steppe rangeland. The experiment was a random-block design, with 20 grassland paddocks of 50 m x 50 m, representing five treatments (i.e., early spring, summer, autumn, mid-winter, and no grazing), replicated by four blocks. We monitored the changes in soil properties, plant litter mass (i.e., standing dead biomass and dead plant material on the soil surface) and plant species composition and production across grazing treatments. Results: Plant community height and above-ground biomass were higher under early spring and winter grazing than autumn and summer grazing and no grazing. This divergence in plant community structure was mainly mediated by the seasonal patterns of plant litter mass across the grazing regimes. A high plant litter mass enhanced soil moisture by accumulating snow in winter and reducing soil evaporation during the growing season, which benefit plant growth. The removal of plant litter before the growing season increased the reception of solar radiation, thus improving soil temperature and plant production. The changes in community microenvironment and selective grazing led to the changes in plant species composition especially under summer and autumn grazing. Conclusions: Our results imply that grazing in winter or in early spring before plants start to turn green is more efficient than the complete animal exclusion for the natural recovery of degraded grassland in Inner Mongolia. It is suitable to incorporate cold-season grazing in the development of sustainable grassland management systems."	13	0	0	0	9	0	13	2023-01-12	WOS:000905172000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

(ii) How do functional strategies of plants to tolerate or avoid grazing affect patterns of aboveground and belowground biomass? Location A natural Campos grassland in the Central Depression of Rio Grande do Sul State, Southern Brazil (latitude 30 degrees 05 ' 27 '' S, longitude 51 degrees 40 ' 18 '' W, and altitude 46 m). Methods We studied the effects of deferments (spring or autumn) at moderate and severe livestock grazing intensities (maintained by adjusting contrasting forage allowances during 25 years) on the cover of dominant species, and aboveground and belowground biomass. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with three replications of grazing exclusions, applied simultaneously at moderate and severe grazing intensities. Measurements of above- and belowground biomass and the coverage of the five dominant species were performed before and after grazing exclusion periods. Results Under severe grazing intensity, erect-growing grasses were replaced by prostrate species, which were able at least to maintain the belowground biomass found at moderate grazing intensity. In response to deferments, severe grazing intensity changed toward a significant increase in aboveground biomass and in the coverage of plants with erect growing habit. However, total belowground biomass remained unaffected by exclusions in both grazing intensities. The relation of root:shoot biomass was lower under moderate grazing intensity, and showed a negative response to deferment treatments at severe grazing intensity. Conclusion Long-term contrasting grazing intensities applied in South American Campos grasslands determine several changes in above- and belowground relationships. Prevalence of prostrate plants under severe grazing is associated with a high partitioning capacity of assimilates toward the subterranean biomass, higher than in the tall species predominant under moderate grazing. The fast recovery of aboveground biomass, the maintenance of the underground biomass and the increase of tall grasses in response to deferments reveals the high resilience capacity of this ecosystem after a long-term period of overgrazing."	10	0	0	0	5	1	11	2022-07-26	WOS:000827949100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Does site variability influence cliff vegetation more than the presence of climbing? Location Linville Gorge Wilderness Area, NC, USA. Methods We compared species richness, Shannon's diversity, abundance and species composition of lichens, bryophytes and vascular plants within 334 plots, each 1 m(2). We compared climbed plots with unclimbed plots using Non-metric Multidimensional (Distance) Scaling ordination, means comparison and regression analysis. Results Eighty-five species were observed within 334 m(2) of cliff-face plots, including one North Carolina state (Canoparmelia alabamensis) and 21 Burke County collection records. Climbing altered cliff plant communities: unclimbed cliffs supported more diverse and different species than did climbed cliffs. However, site was more important than was climbing in differentiating cliff community composition. Variation in species composition was driven mostly by variation in cliff aspect and surface heterogeneity. Cliffs with the highest surface heterogeneity had the highest species richness, diversity and abundance of all three vegetation types (lichens, bryophytes and vascular plants). Unclimbed areas had similar richness, diversity and abundance compared with easy climbing routes, whereas harder climbing routes supported lower species richness and abundance of all vegetation types. Conclusions Differences in cliff-face vegetation in Linville Gorge were due more to site variability than to climbing impact. Therefore, management of climbing areas and decisions for future route development should be site-specific and include a thorough biological survey."	10	0	0	0	7	0	10	2022-06-20	WOS:000808382400001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Site preparation prior to planting longleaf pine seedlings is often required to overcome challenges to seedling establishment on hydric sites. We know site preparation improves growth and survival of planted longleaf pine on hydric sites, but what are the impacts of site preparation on the understorey plant community? Location Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Onslow County, NC, USA. Methods This study tested eight site preparation treatments, including an untreated control, six combinations of two vegetation control treatments (chopping or herbicide) with three soil manipulation treatments (mounding, bedding, or flat-planting [no treatment]), and a chopping-herbicide-bedding treatment. We collected data on understorey plant abundance, diversity, and composition through the first three and at 15 years after plantation establishment. We used ANOVA procedures and multivariate ordination to test for differences in understorey responses among the study treatments and through time. Results Site preparation had lasting impacts on the understorey plant community. The chop-only treatment was the only treatment that resulted in dominance of herbaceous vegetation and was among the treatments with the highest diversity and greatest abundance of Aristida stricta (wiregrass). Herbicide produced lasting reductions in Aristida stricta abundance and apparent shifts in community composition. Reduced graminoid abundance was particularly pronounced when herbicide was combined with soil manipulation treatments. Conclusions Understorey responses to site preparation through 3 years differed from responses observed in year 15, highlighting the importance of long-term monitoring. For example, herbicides controlled shrubs early, but by year 15, herbicide treatments were dominated by shrubs. Restoration scenarios often must balance ecological objectives (e.g., maintenance of a diverse understorey community) with forestry objectives (e.g., timely establishment of overstorey trees), and our findings can be used as a guide to balance these trade-offs."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Yet, the long-term environmental impacts of nuclear accidents remain unclear. Here we asked how ionizing radiation affects tree regeneration and forest development after the Chernobyl nuclear accident. We hypothesized that high levels of Cs-137 contamination in the soil: (a) inhibit tree establishment; (b) accelerate structural development (i.e., facilitation of an early differentiation of tree sizes); while (c) prolonging the dominance of early-seral deciduous communities (because of an elevated susceptibility of conifers to ionizing radiation). Location Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine. Methods We sampled 103 plots on former agricultural lands in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone that were abandoned after the accident in 1986. Results Contamination had no significant effect on the stem density of forests established on former agricultural lands (p = 0.769). Structural development was not accelerated by radioactive contamination (p > 0.191), but we did find weak indications that the presence of tree regeneration was reduced by high radiation levels (p = 0.054). Tree species composition did not vary significantly with contamination (p = 0.250). Individual Scots pine trees did, however, experience a considerably higher proportion of deformed stems when contamination levels were high (p = 0.009). Conclusions Our analyses confirm negative effects of radioactive contamination on the individual tree health of Scots pine, yet early stand development in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was largely insensitive to different levels of radiation. As wildfires threaten to remobilize and redistribute radionuclides stored in the growing forests of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, our findings have potential implications for human health. We conclude that forest dynamics is a key element for assessing the long-term risk at nuclear accident sites and requires intensified research and monitoring."	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	2022-04-13	WOS:000774733000007	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

A chronosequence of sites was used to assess potential changes in plant community composition in post-fire succession of paramo.Results The recovery of paramo vegetation after fire comprised three phases: initial recruitment with high growth form diversity, followed by reduced diversity, light and soil temperatures in dense tussock vegetation, and ultimately canopy height stratification with a return of diversity. All but one of the plant growth forms were represented in each of the three phases, and the changes reflected differences in relative abundance.Conclusions Post-fire paramo succession is characterised by clear shifts in the relative abundance of plant growth forms, ending with (co-)dominance of upright shrubs.

Results of a vegetation-monitoring experiment were subsequently published in 1983. This study followed up the original research to investigate whether observed trends were as predicted. These included a shift in tree species composition in favour of shade-tolerant species, beech (Fagus sylvatica) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), at the expense of light-demanding birch (Betula spp.) and oak (Quercus petraea agg.), and progress towards a typical woodland ground flora.Location: Peak District National Park, United Kingdom.Methods: The mixed oak-birch woodland was re-surveyed in 2011. Two enclosures (1955 and 1980s) and an unenclosed control area were investigated. Overstorey structure and composition was assessed by measuring canopy openness and the girths of all trees and saplings. Herb layer species composition was also recorded in 28 vegetation plots.Results: We demonstrated a progressive decline in the number of mature oaks and birch in the old enclosure although they still regenerated successfully. Only a few individuals of beech and rowan appeared. Herb layer species composition differed between the subareas but since the 1980s, the temporal change in the old enclosure was negligible. The new enclosure followed a similar pattern in both canopy and herb layer as observed in the early years in the old enclosure. However, the control subarea had no regeneration of woody species and limited ground flora.Conclusions: After nearly 60 years, the replacement of light-demanding dominants by shade-tolerant trees was still limited, probably by low pH and stable light conditions.

Methods In 2014, we resurveyed 92 vegetation plots sampled in 1968, belonging to nine plant communities distributed on basic and acid soils. We performed estimates of alpha- and beta-diversity, multidimensional ordination of species composition, ecological characterisation of species and non-parametric tests to identify vegetation change over time. Results We observed different patterns of vegetation change depending on the plant community; an increase in alpha-diversity, especially in high-altitude habitats, and a homogenisation of species composition among plant communities. Seral communities and forests increased particularly in locations on basic soils that used to be occupied by pastures and communities of degraded successional stages. Higher Ellenberg indicator values of temperature and light, and loss of temperate taxa, which are usually rare in the region, were found in the climax forest of high altitudes and some acidophilous communities. However, altitudinal shifts of species distributions were detected only in 14% of plant species, both upwards and downwards. An increase of nitrophily at medium altitudes was also observed.

Differences across tree groupings and splits associated response thresholds with specific explanatory conditions.Results Pockets of substantial Pinus echinata regeneration (>3,000 stems/ha), C-4 grass density (>40,000 ramets/ha), and herbaceous diversity (increase from 22 to 205 species) occurred 7-14 years after canopy disturbance and 3-8 fires. Such shortleaf-bluestem response was maximized at 3 m(2)/ha residual tree basal area, 11% canopy closure, reduced midstorey density (5,000 small-sapling stems/ha), and southwesterly aspects within 70 m of mature Pinus echinata. In contrast, shortleaf-bluestem response was negligible at 11.3 m(2)/ha basal area and 68% canopy closure. Fire season, snag basal area, slope, and slope position effects were minimal.Conclusions We identified specific conditions fostering the co-existence of desired herbaceous and woody understorey components, addressing a major woodland and savanna restoration challenge and expanding on previous threshold concept applications by simultaneously considering multiple desired responses. Results can direct the restoration of imperiled shortleaf-bluestem communities east of the Mississippi River, USA, where work has been scarce or ineffective, and similar approaches could inform fire-dependent woodland and savanna restoration worldwide."	4	0	0	0	4	0	4	2020-04-13	WOS:000522603200003	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The GMP are based on rotational grazing systems (RGS) with animal stocking rate adjusted to balance grassland carrying capacity. The aim was to test the 5-year effects produced by GMP implementation on botanical composition, plant diversity and soil nutrient content on sub-alpine and alpine pastures.Location: Val Troncea Natural Park, western Italian Alps.Methods: A total of 199 vegetation transects was carried out in summer 2011 and repeated in summer 2016. The botanical composition was recorded and plant diversity indices, i.e. species richness and Shannon diversity (H ' index), were computed. Mean soil nutrient content was indirectly estimated through computation of Landolt N indicator value (N index) for each transect. Pair-sample statistical tests and PERMANOVA were perfomed at different levels: on the whole vegetation dataset, on vegetation communities (i.e. vegetation types and ecological groups) and considering functional pools of species.Results: Considering the whole vegetation dataset, species richness, H ' index and N index significantly increased from 2011 to 2016. Moreover, species richness significantly increased in almost all vegetation ecological groups, with the highest increase within the mesotrophic group. The H ' index significantly increased in eutrophic, pre-forest and thermic groups, while the N index increased in all vegetation groups, except in the eutrophic and snow-bed groups. A significant difference in botanical composition was detected within oligotrophic, mesotrophic and thermic groups. The number and cover of N-poor high-elevation species increased in all groups and this result might be related to effects produced by livestock, which promoted seed transport and increased connectivity amongst different communities. The meso-eutrophic species number and cover significantly increased within thermic, mesotrophic and pre-forest groups, suggesting greater use of such areas by livestock under RGS than under continuous grazing.Conclusions: The implementation of RGS with stocking rate adjustments proved to be an effective and a sustainable management tool to enhance botanical composition and plant diversity of sub-alpine and alpine grasslands over a 5-year span."	30	2	0	0	20	0	31	2018-10-01	WOS:000450061000009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We checked the species composition and availability of seeds in hay in 15 haystacks of the eight oldest feeding stations, which could be a potential source of seeds. Vegetation and soil seed bank were sampled on the overlapping 10mx10m plots distributed along 500-m long transects running south and north of the studied feeding stations. Seed content in the soil samples was studied by the seedling emergence method in an unheated greenhouse.ResultsWe revealed high dissimilarity of species composition of the hayseed, soil seed bank and standing vegetation. The dissimilarity between soil seed banks and standing vegetation increased with the distance from the haystack. The species richness of the standing vegetation was not affected by distance to the haystack, while seed bank species richness showed a significant negative correlation with distance. The mean weighted ecological indicator values of pH, light and soil fertility were negatively correlated with the distance from the haystack for the seed bank and the standing vegetation. The percentage of damaged bushes and juvenile trees was positively correlated with their density and decreased with the distance from the haystack.ConclusionsWe revealed distinct but local (25-50m off the haystack) effect of supplementary feeding on the vegetation and soil seed banks of forest ecosystems. Taking into account the ecosystem approach to nature conservation, the winter feeding in forest ecosystems should be concentrated in few places to avoid the expansion of non-native plant species in forest ecosystems. To prevent potential plant invasions, the origin of the hay used as supplementary winter fodder should be carefully selected, with a preference for local origin and making of hay of native plant species in the forest's meadows or in its surroundings."	6	0	0	0	5	0	7	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, long-term studies at the community scale are rare, particularly for the European High Arctic. We ask: (1) has Arctic vegetation changed over the past century; (2) can observed changes be related to recent climate change; and (3) do observed changes in vegetation prevail for specific species or species functional groups?Location: The Svalbard Archipelago, High Arctic Norway.Methods: In 2009 we resurveyed three plant sociological studies up to 85 yrs after the first surveys. Vegetation data were recorded from 1-m(2) non-permanently marked plots, and soil pH was measured. We applied restricted permutation tests to evaluate whether observed changes in vegetation (species richness, occurrence frequency, coverage) and in soil pH were significant and independent of plant community type. We compared species co-occurrences over time to study changes in species composition and to identify the species most likely causing these changes.Results: Total number of species and average number of species per plot has not changed, and are 75 and nine, respectively. Occurrence frequency changed significantly for 34% of the 64 species tested (11 species increased, 11 decreased). Species cover decreased significantly for 27% of the species and increased for one species. Observed changes in frequency and cover are not significantly related to species' functional groups or species affiliated to moist or dry habitats. Polygonum viviparum, Saxifraga cernua and Alopecurus borealis have changed most in co-occurring with other species. Soil pH increased significantly from 6.4 to 6.8.Conclusions: Our results suggest that the strong climatic warming in the High Arctic over the past decades has contributed to significant changes in the vegetation studied on Svalbard over the past 85 yrs. Internal community restructuring and the overall stability in species richness may be explained by time-delayed responses of well-established communities, and/ or by a limited size of the species pool in the area."	20	0	0	0	16	0	22	2017-04-26	WOS:000398083700006	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

However, fewer studies have investigated how shifts in the composition of urban species pools may alter spatial variation in community assembly across patches within a city. We compared plant diversity both within and between vacant lots in a single urban neighborhood and asked: (1) how do heterogeneous human legacies of land use within vacant lots structure plant community diversity and composition and (2) what is the importance of human legacies for structuring community composition, relative to spatial and environmental variation?LocationUrban residential neighbourhood in Baltimore, MD, US (39 degrees 17N, 76 degrees 38W).MethodsWe surveyed herbaceous plant species identity and abundance in 24 unmanaged vacant lots. We constructed functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics from databases and the literature and compared taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity between sections of the lot where a residential building was once located (building footprint), and the area that was originally the garden or backyard (remnant garden). We term these different human legacy' groups. We partitioned variation in plant community composition between human legacy groups as well as across measured environmental and spatial gradients.ResultsWe report significant plant community compositional divergence between human legacy groups. Beta-diversity, in particular, was significantly higher in remnant garden sections compared to building footprint sections for all metrics of biodiversity. Plant community compositional variation was primarily explained by differences in human legacies. We found no measurable effects of selected metrics of local environmental variation (abiotic soil characteristics) or environmental context (lot area, proximity to other vacant lots and tree canopy) on compositional variation. Geographic distance between sites, however, did interact with human legacy variation to structure phylogenetic composition.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that human land-use legacies have complex but measurable effects on both the patterns and the processes by which species co-existence is maintained across the urban landscape. Within a single habitat type (here, residential vacant lots), variation in legacies of land use may have a stronger plant community structuring effect than contemporary environmental variation."	55	1	0	0	47	0	65	2015-07-01	WOS:000356007400016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do epizoochorously-induced spatial patterns persist during vegetation development? Does sandy grassland develop, which is rich in epizoochorously-dispersed target species?LocationUpper Rhine Valley, Germany.MethodsA 6-yr experiment on epizoochorous dispersal by sheep was conducted on three newly created deep sand deposition sites mimicking restoration areas with reduced nutrient availability. Establishment success and persistence of ten epizoochorously-dispersed species were assessed and spatial patterns were analysed using SADIE (Spatial Analysis by Distance Indices). Vegetation development of the experimental areas was related to a nearby nature reserve (releves, target species ratios). In addition, seed rain and early-successional soil seed bank were sampled.ResultsAll but one species dispersed by sheep became established and persisted during the 6-yr study. After establishment, most perennials did not change or increased in abundance over time, whereas annuals showed various population dynamics. Spatial patterns were aggregated for most study species. Similarity of spatial patterns between consecutive years varied by species, site and year, and was stronger in perennial than in annual species. Patterns of seed dispersal and establishment were positively associated with each other (a subset of three species was tested). Within 6yrs, the proportion, but not the cover, of target species in the experimental areas reached a level similar to that of a nearby nature reserve; however, many species characteristic of the nature reserve were absent. The species compositions of both seed bank and seed rain were dominated by non-target species.ConclusionsSheep flocks may assist in colonization of grassland species on newly created bare soil areas via epizoochory. The incorporation of livestock into restoration projects might facilitate the regeneration and preservation of threatened plant populations. Livestock might be most successful in promoting biodiversity if they are moved from communities with target species to restoration areas."	21	0	0	0	20	0	23	2014-01-22	WOS:000328544400009	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Species richness, composition and germinant density were determined using the seedling emergence method. Seed persistence was assessed by comparing seed densities in spring and autumn. Seed bank composition was compared with the vegetation.Results: The spring seed bank was dominated at all stages by sedges and rushes; hence, native species richness and seed density were largely unaffected by abandonment. In autumn, grassland species contributed more to the seed bank, but richness was reduced after abandonment and showed little recovery, although seed density partially recovered. Seed bank composition showed some recovery in both seasons. Most species had low persistence in the soil. Compositional similarity between the vegetation and seed bank was greater in old fields than uncultivated grasslands in spring, but not autumn.Conclusions: Resilience varied among seed bank parameters and seed banks had low functional importance. Patterns in the seed bank followed, rather than caused, those in the vegetation. Thus, vegetation recovery cannot rely on the seed bank and persistent seeds were not the key mechanism of resilience in the vegetation."	25	2	0	0	25	2	28	2012-02-01	WOS:000299207600006	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Each block (n=4) contained all five treatments and understory vegetation was surveyed within 0.04-ha plots for each treatment.ResultsWhile mastication alone and hand removal dramatically reduced the midstory vegetation, these treatments had little effect on understory richness compared with control. Prescribed fire after mastication increased native species richness by 150% (+6.0 species m2) compared with control. However, this also increased non-native species richness (+0.8 species m2) and shrub seedling density (+24.7 stems m2). Mastication followed by tilling resulted in increased non-native forb density (+0.7 stems m2).ConclusionsMechanical mastication and hand removal treatments aided in reducing midstory fuels but did not increase understory plant diversity. The subsequent treatment of prescribed burning not only further reduced fire hazard, but also exposed mineral soil, which likely promoted native plant diversity. Some potential drawbacks to this treatment include an increase of non-native species and stimulation of shrub seed germination, which could alter ecosystem functions and compromise fire hazard reduction in the long-term."	42	0	0	0	35	0	64	2010-04-01	WOS:000274819200007	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Within Cashmere treatments, the cover and height of live shrubs decreased more and the herbaceous cover increased more under high than under low stocking rate. Redundancy analysis showed a significant effect of treatment x year interaction on floristic composition. Greater species richness was recorded under local goat grazing, but Shannon diversity index fell in the fourth year on these plots because of dominance by two grass species.Conclusions: Local Celtiberic goat grazing at such a high stocking rate (11.7 goats ha(-1)) hinders the development of sustainable systems on these heathlands, both in environmental and productive terms, owing to the limitations in soil fertility. Nevertheless, Celtiberic goats could be useful for controlling excessive shrub encroachment and reducing fire hazard.

Changes in species composition were studied over 5 years. The data on changes in species composition was analysed by constrained and unconstrained ordinations, and visualized using Principal Response Curves,Results: Species composition of newly abandoned wet grasslands was changing towards the corresponding long-abandoned plots even in the first year of abandonment. Similarly, newly established restoration mowing in abandoned dry grasslands rapidly shifted the stand species composition towards that of traditionally managed ones. Nevertheless, 4 year after reintroduction of mowing, the species composition of the restored plots was still far from the target composition. The effect of mowing in abandoned wet grasslands and abandonment in dry grasslands was much less pronounced and slower.Conclusions: Moisture regime is a very important factor determining the management needs of various grassland types. Wet grasslands are much more sensitive to abandonment, with a rapid degradation rate and limited possibilities for restoration, which can be extremely slow.

To overcome dispersal limitation we transferred freshly mown plant material from species-rich sources to a restoration site on a former arable field. Before plant material application, topsoil was removed to accelerate nutrient impoverishment and create favourable conditions for seedling recruitment. Topsoil removal led to a drastic reduction in organic matter and essential mineral nutrients to the level of target communities (P) or even below (N, K). At a removal depth of 30 cm content of the soil seed bank that comprised exclusively of annual arable weeds, ruderals and some common grassland species, declined by 60-80%, while at a removal depth of 50 cm the seed bank was almost completely eliminated. With few exceptions, all species recorded in source plant material were found established at the restoration site. However, the overall correlation between seed content in plant material and establishment success was not very high. Vegetation development at the restoration site was characterized by a rapid decline in arable weeds and ruderals, while resident grassland species and species transferred with plant material increased rapidly from the third year onwards. After four years as many as 102 species were established that could be exclusively attributed to plant material transfer, among them many rare and highly endangered plants. Establishment of species from plant material was most successful in regularly flooded plots, due to the suppression of competitors as well as the creation of favourable moisture conditions for seedling emergence.

To define the alternative states and thresholds for these ecosystems, we conducted a restoration experiment that included sites with high, intermediate or low water tables. We used a paired-plot approach in which one plot on each site was burned and seeded with native grasses and forbs typical of naturally occurring dry meadow and Artemisia/Leymus cinereus ecological types, while adjacent unburned plots served as controls. Sites with high and intermediate water tables had greater initial abundances of perennial grasses typical of dry meadows, such as Leymus triticoides and Poa secunda ssp. juncifolia, and these species increased after the burn. In contrast, sites with low water tables were dominated by annual forbs such as Chenopodium album and Descurainia pinnata after the burn. Biomass increased progressively from 1997 to 1999 on burned plots, while controls showed little change. Burning effects were microsite specific, with former Artemisia microsites exhibiting lower biomass than interspaces initially, but similar or higher biomass by the third year. Establishment of seeded species was low and species composition was determined largely by pre-burn vegetation. Artemisia dominated sites with high water tables appear to represent an alternative state of the dry meadow ecological type, while sites with low water table sites have crossed an abiotic threshold governed by water tables and represent a new ecological type. Burning is an effective tool for restoring relatively high water table sites, but low water table sites will require burning and seeding with species adapted to more xeric conditions."	36	0	0	0	24	0	43	2002-12-01	WOS:000181162900009	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Vegetation change was monitored in a cut-away peatland one year before, and four years after, rewetting. Colonizers before rewetting were perennials, mostly typical of hummocks or bare peat surfaces. The main variation in vegetation was related to variation in the amounts of major nutrients and water table level. The wettest site with the highest nutrient level had the highest total vegetation cover and diversity, as well as some species typical of wet minerotrophic mires. Raising the water table level above, or close to, the soil surface promoted development of wet minerotrophic vegetation. Diversity initially decreased because of the disappearance of hummock vegetation but started to recover in the third year. Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex rostrata were both favoured, and bryophytes typical of wet habitats colonized the site. Moderate rewetting promoted the development of Eriophorum vaginatum seedlings and an increase in the cover of tussocks. Bryophytes typical of disturbed peat surfaces spread. In the control site development continued slowly towards closed hummock vegetation. The study showed that raising the water level to, or above, soil surface promotes conditions wet enough for a rapid succession towards closed mire vegetation."	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	2000-12-01	BCI:BCI200100115960	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	3	1	NA	NA	25	32	NA	10.2307/1478915	Article	MAY 2000	2000	". Semi-natural grasslands are a threatened biotope type in many countries. Typical grassland plant species are adapted to continuous grazing or mowing that keeps the environment open. With the decline in grassland area, these species are ever more reliant on alternative habitats such as road verges. To find out whether plant communities comparable to those of semi-natural grasslands can be maintained on modern road and railway sides, the vegetation of 92 grasslands and 90 road and railway verges was studied. These biotope types were compared with each other according to their community structure, total number of species, number of grassland species and restricted-range diversity. Further study of the vegetation of road and railway verges was carried out in order to identify the treatments and environments which are most likely to support diverse plant communities. The species number and the restricted-range diversity proved to be higher next to roads and railways than on grasslands. Grassland species were, however, most abundant on grasslands. Furthermore, the community structure of these biotope types was totally divergent. In their present state, road and railway verges are not a substitute for semi-natural grasslands. Nevertheless, the occurrence of grassland species in verges may be enhanced by a suitable mowing regime, by giving up the use of de-icing salt and herbicides and by allowing natural establishment of vegetation on the verges."	67	1	0	0	57	0	79	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We studied pre-restoration seed banks and pre- and post-restoration plant communities of former cranberry farms, whose native peat was covered with anthropogenically placed sand during cultivation and that underwent hydrologic restoration.LocationThree retired cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton) farm complexes in southeast Massachusetts, USA, that underwent hydrologic restoration between 2017 and 2020.MethodsWe quantified seed germination from sand and peat collected from former farms in a greenhouse under three hydrologic treatments (inundated, saturated, and well-drained) to assess the pre-restoration seed bank composition. In the field, we surveyed plant species presence and cover both before and after restoration at permanent 9 m2 plots. We assessed species composition, richness, and diversity in seed bank treatments and in situ. We also measured changes in in situ vegetation over time and compared seed bank and in situ vegetation.ResultsThe 30 species that germinated from retired cranberry farm seed banks were primarily native, perennial, wetland-adapted, and occurred in the sand but not peat. Highest germination rates and species richness occurred in saturated substrate, with very little germination in the well-drained treatment. Seed banks were not predictive of post-restoration in situ species richness, but post-restoration vegetation was similarly native, perennial, and wetland-adapted. Restoration increased in situ total plant and wetland-adapted plant species richness compared with pre-restoration, and this richness persisted for multiple years post-restoration. Wetland plant cover was more variable and likely affected by year-to-year changes in growing season precipitation.ConclusionsVegetation responses to wetland restoration at formerly cultivated sites indicate that diverse, native plant communities can regenerate following hydrologic restoration in sites with sandy, nutrient-poor soils."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-05-02	WOS:001476217500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Grasslands are likely the type of vegetation most affected by these transformations. This study investigates the multifaceted changes in plant diversity over the past four decades in a major valley of the Italian Eastern Alps and examines whether changes occurred uniformly across different elevations.LocationValsugana Valley, Eastern Alps, Italy.MethodsIn 2022, we resurveyed 115 vegetation plots (including vascular plants, mosses, and lichens) originally sampled in 1986-1988. Plots were collected in grasslands and span along an elevation gradient of 2000 m. At each time period, we automatically classified these plots using the EUNIS expert system of habitats. We analysed the variation over time in species richness, species diversity, beta diversity (turnover and nestedness), and relative proportion of life form, woodiness, and neophyte species along an elevation gradient, subdivided in low-, middle-, and high-elevation belts. Lastly, we quantified the number of gained, winning, stable, losing, and lost species.ResultsWe found differences in the classification of EUNIS habitats and elevation-dependent changes in community diversity and composition. Many grassland types were transformed into other grassland types or into forests and man-made habitats. Species richness varied along the elevation gradient over time, being constant at lower elevations but markedly increasing at high elevations. Temporal turnover dominated across elevations, especially at lower sites, while nestedness components increased towards high elevations. Neophytes increased and hemicryptophytes decreased in the low-elevation belt, while therophytes and geophytes increased at low- and high-elevation belts. In the middle-elevation belt, many dry grassland species were replaced by nitrophilous and woody species. High-elevation witnessed species replacement with the loss of mountain species and the increase of therophyte and geophyte species.ConclusionsGrasslands of Valsugana valley have undergone substantial changes over four decades. Different processes likely acted across the elevation gradient. Nonetheless the driver, impoverishment of semi-natural grassland species was observed over time across elevations. Understanding these changes in vegetation is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of ecological variations over time. Conservation management strategies should be tailored to address biodiversity changes at varying elevations to counteract the negative trends of plant diversity loss and the ongoing habitat transformation of grasslands in the Alps."	5	0	0	0	0	0	5	2025-02-13	WOS:001415071400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We also aimed to assess whether species-group responses help explain variation in community composition.LocationsAn Artemisia steppe community in Golestan National Park (northeast Iran).MethodsWe used the relative interaction index (RII) to quantify the effects of a shrub on the cover of the 12 most frequent subordinate species. We conducted a first principal component analysis (PCA) on species RII followed by cluster analysis to group species depending on their responses to the shrub, and a second PCA on subordinate species composition.ResultsAt the community level, subordinate species showed strong competition at the low grazing level, weak facilitation at the intermediate level and weak competition at the high grazing level; a unimodal pattern with a switch back to competition in extremely disturbed conditions that is inconsistent with ecological theories. However, species-group analyses showed contrasting subordinate species responses, supporting either the decrease in competition with increasing disturbance scenario or the collapse of facilitation, but never a switch back to competition as predicted by recent facilitation theory along resource gradients. Moreover, these contrasting species-group responses significantly explained community composition.ConclusionsOur study provides new evidence, along a grazing intensity gradient, that communities include different species groups with contrasting responses to dominant species.We quantified the cover of understorey species under the shrub Artemisia sieberi and in open plots along a grazing gradient in an arid steppe.

Shrub removal by land managers is widespread, but the long-term effects on vegetation structure and composition, which determine carrying capacity for herbivores, are poorly documented. This study aims to examine the effects of selective shrub removal to guide vegetation management in key land uses of semi-arid African savannas.QuestionsVegetation responses were assessed across land uses and treatments to answer the following questions: (1) does shrub removal increase the frequency of palatable plants and therefore herbivore-carrying capacity; (2) does selective shrub removal decrease woody vegetation structure 15 years after application; and (3) how do these effects differ between cattle and wildlife ranching?LocationMolopo region of the North West Province, South Africa.MethodsHerbaceous and woody vegetations were sampled within six transects each of three wildlife ranches and three cattle ranches in areas that had either been selectively shrub-controlled with herbicides 10-15 years previously or left untreated. To quantify effects of woody shrub control on herbaceous functional-group abundances and assemblages, tree equivalents, regrowth rate, and shrub abundance, we compared these variables across two treatments (treated and untreated) and land uses. Data were analysed using GLMMs, NMDS ordinations, PERMANOVA, and SIMPER.ResultsSelective shrub control effectively improved palatable herbaceous vegetation, especially on cattle ranches. Especially abundance of perennial grass was higher on wildlife ranches compared to cattle ranches. Tree equivalent was higher in untreated compared to treated plots, and these differences were more pronounced on wildlife ranches than on cattle ranches.ConclusionssSelective shrub removal improved the palatable herbaceous layer for both wildlife and cattle ranching and can be considered an effective management strategy in semi-arid rangelands.After 15 years of application, selective shrub control significantly enhanced palatable herbaceous vegetation, especially on cattle ranches. Wildlife ranches exhibited notably higher abundance of perennial grass, emphasising the lasting effectiveness of shrub control for rangeland improvement across different land-use types.image"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2024-01-01	WOS:001129252900001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

In this review, we examine the knowledge on grazing hay meadows in the Carpathian Mountains, including its historical distribution, implementation and timing, potential impacts on grassland productivity and biodiversity, and implications for grassland conservation and restoration. LocationThe Carpathian Mountains (43.8-50.1 degrees N, 16.9-27.1 degrees E). MethodsWe conducted a literature review including biological, ecological, agricultural, ethnological, and historical sources. Results and ConclusionsIn each of the seven farming systems that existed in parallel in the Carpathian Mountains before agricultural intensification, grazing of hay meadows was applied regularly. Spring, autumn, and occasionally summer grazing, along with corralling and manuring of hay meadows, were integral parts of these systems, adapted to the seasonal movement of dairy farms across various agroecosystems. The data reviewed provide insight into the role of animals in hay meadow management, as well as how the breakdown of these historical farming systems is impacting local biodiversity, the economy, and the community. According to the literature sources, grazing hay meadows has numerous positive impacts on grassland biodiversity, including suppressing fast-growing competitors, reducing the accumulation of litter, increasing the availability of germination gaps, dispersing seeds through zoochory, supporting ground-nesting birds through later mowing, and promoting the regeneration of plants from seeds. From this perspective, the combination of mowing and grazing can be considered a promising tool in current grassland conservation and restoration efforts."	18	0	0	0	8	0	21	2023-09-25	WOS:000976720000001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Does grazing management shape the proportion of plant guilds (grasses, legumes, forbs and sedges) in mountain grasslands?2. Which properties of grazing management have the greatest effect on the proportion of plant guilds: grazer diversity/identity or grazing intensity?3. Are the effects of grazing management on guild proportion modified by other environmental variables that explain plant guild distribution at broad spatial scales? Location: Mountains in the Pyrenees.Methods: We modelled the proportion of grasses, legumes, forbs and sedges using data from the PASTUS database (n = 96), which contains a wide range of environmental and management conditions dueto the high variety of environmental conditions in mountain grasslands in the Pyrenees. We used a machine-learning algorithm to find those variables that best explained the proportions of each plant guild. We focussed on the differences between the levels of grazing intensity and the grazing species included in the model, and on detecting interactions between grazing variables and climate, topography and soil conditions.Results: The proportion of forbs and grasses strongly depended on the grazing live-stock species at broad spatial scales. Only soil pH showed a higher overall explanatory power on guild distribution. In general, forbs were favoured in cattle-and grasses in sheep-grazed grasslands, the latter also being favoured on acidic soils, while forbs were favoured in more alkaline soil conditions. However, the effects of those factors (grazing species and soil pH) were modulated through interactions with several other environmental variables, including soil Mg, K and P, and terrain slope. In contrast, grazing intensity was a minor driver of guild distribution.Conclusions: Our results provide information about the relationship between plant functional diversity, indicated by the different plant guild proportions, and grazing management in the Pyrenean grasslands. This information could be useful for devel-oping hypotheses for future experimental studies and for designing policies to im-prove the management of mountain grasslands."	7	0	0	0	5	0	7	2023-09-25	WOS:000981475300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

To that end, finding appropriate indicators and reference ecosystems is mandatory, especially for habitats in which restoration projects have been barely evaluated over the long term, such as coastal sand dunes. Do different indicators provide complementary information to evaluate restoration success? How successful is sand dune restoration after 30 years?Location: Brittany (France).Methods: We report changes in the plant community over a period of 30 years following restoration using trampling protection and marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) planting in four sites that were highly degraded by sand extraction and over-frequentation. We used several indicator types (geomorphological, taxonomic, functional) at different spatial scales (alpha, beta, gamma) to assess recovery since restoration in four sites of the northern coast of Brittany and undertook comparison with reference sites.Results: Our results indicate that over the 30 years after restoration the gamma richness of typical species and overall vegetation conservation status increased. We also found that restoration induces the recovery of zonation in plant communities, which become organized along the typical sea-inland gradient. We showed that use of functional traits and diversity indices is effective to compare restored communities with reference data from the literature. Based on this approach, we demonstrated that, according to most functional indicators, restored communities converge over time with the patterns found in reference data.Conclusions: We demonstrated that restoration of coastal dunes after 30 years induced the recovery of sand accumulation, typical species cover, sea-inland plant community zonation and community functional characteristics. Despite these positive results, which indicated overall success and confirmed interest in such restoration projects, we found an important discrepancy in restoration success among study sites (e.g., level of recovery of typical species cover, functional diversity).

Photographic digital image analysis (DIA) is frequently used in seral, single-strata vegetation, given its greater objectivity and repeatability compared to observer visual estimation; however, its efficacy in multi-strata forest vegetation may be compromised, where various visual obstructions (coarse downed wood [CDW], conifer regeneration, and shadows) may conceal plant cover in the digital imagery. We asked whether vegetation complexity influences plant cover estimated by DIA relative to two visual methods: plot-level (20 m(2)) estimation (PLE) and quadrat-level (1 m(2)) estimation (QLE)?Location: Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, USA.Methods: We estimated understorey plant cover in subalpine forest vegetation on permanent plots (n = 141) at two study areas similar to 30 years after the 1988 Yellowstone fires to: (a) assess differences in visual obstructions between study areas in our digital imagery; (b) compare digital to visual estimates of plant cover; and (c) determine relationships between estimated plant cover and visual obstructions measured in situ.Results: Percent conifer regeneration pixels differed significantly (odds ratio = 8.34) between study areas which represented the greatest difference in visual obstructions. At the study area with lower conifer pixels, DIA estimated 9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3%-14%) and 16% (95% CI = 10%-21%) more understorey plant cover than PLE or QLE, respectively, but had comparable variability. At the study area with higher conifer pixels, DIA estimated 28% (95% CI = 24%-32%) and 22% (95% CI = 18%-26%) less understorey plant cover than PLE or QLE, respectively, and had more variability. Furthermore, plot-level subcanopy regeneration (height>137 cm) density was negatively associated with digitally derived plant cover but showed no relationship with visually derived plant cover.Conclusions: Post-fire conifer regeneration hindered the efficacy of DIA in estimating understorey plant cover.

Uruguay is part of the Rio de la Plata grasslands, and 60% is occupied by native grasslands dominated by perennial species.

We asked: how do the structural characteristics of vegetation vary in patches with different time since the last fire? Location Grassland of the Eastern Hills, Uruguay. Methods We selected 18 grazed sites in order to obtain a spatial chronosequence with four age categories since the last fire: 6, 18, 30, and more than 60 months before sampling. Plant composition, species richness, coverage of each species, bare soil, and standing dead biomass were determined in plots of 25 m(2). We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the multiresponse permutation procedure (MRPP) to determine differences in community composition, and the ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare structural variables between patches of different burning ages. Results Patches of different burning age had different species compositions. Species richness, Shannon diversity index, evenness, and bare soil decreased, whereas plant coverage, standing dead biomass, and vegetation strata increased as time since the last fire increased. Conclusions Our study confirmed occasional and localized field-burns as major driver of vegetation change and structural diversity in a grazed native grassland dominated by a tall tussock grass. On a larger scale, we observed the coexistence of patches in different successional stages and differences in species composition between patches belonging to early stages.

In Switzerland, many of these grasslands are degraded even though they have been under protection since the 1980s. Degradation shows two divergent trends: Nardus grasslands are either dominated by Nardus stricta or by eutrophic plants, both trends leading to the disappearance of typical Nardus grassland species. With this study, we aim to identify the factors that could be adjusted to conserve the integrity of this habitat. Location: Bernese Alps, Switzerland. Methods: In 2016, we investigated the underlying causes of this degradation process by assessing vegetation composition in 48 Nardus grasslands located in the Swiss northern Alps of canton Bern and linking it to soil, management and environmental variables. To explore the effect of the degradation on higher trophic levels, orthopteran species richness and densities were assessed. Results: Results show that Nardus meadows (mown) are rarely degraded compared to Nardus pastures (grazed). Within pastures, eutrophic plants are most abundant on small pastures with low soil carbon/nitrogen ratio, indicating high nutrient availability. Nardus stricta dominance is most problematic on north-exposed slopes and in summer pastures. A plausible driver of both degradation trends is the grazing management regime: within small pastures at low elevation where the grazing periods are short but intense, soil carbon/nitrogen ratio is low because of high dung deposition, thus the eutrophic species become dominant. Contrastingly, on large summer pastures with low-intensity and long-term grazing, N. stricta becomes dominant due to selective grazing.

Plant functional traits help to understand management impact on rich fen vegetation	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	22	1	NA	NA	27	38	NA	10.1111/avsc.12411	Article	JAN 2019	2019	"Questions Fens are important conservation targets in temperate Europe. When hydrologically undisturbed, fens remain open for millennia. However, unaltered fens are scarce, and today their biodiversity largely depends on conservational mowing applied to prevent successional shifts. However, the effects on community structure and conservation values are uncertain, and management might not always be needed where it is a priori applied by managers. Thus, within the presented study, we ask the following questions: (a) How is the species and functional composition of fens influenced by mowing? (b) Does mowing increase the conservation value of fen ecosystems? Location Lowland fens, northern Poland. Methods The sample consisted of 27 pairs of mown and unmown plots, located within ten sites. Ordination methods were used to assess the influence of mowing on species composition. Functional traits related to competitiveness, flowering time, mycorrhizal associations and functional groups were used to characterize plant communities and species richness, and the number of specialist and red-listed species was used to evaluate conservation values. Differences between mown and unmown plots were assessed using linear mixed-effect models and the effect size approach. Results Management of fens suppresses the growth of trees, shrubs and highly competitive herbaceous species and inhibits the encroachment of Sphagnum mosses. At the same time, it enhances the establishment of species from other ecosystems (grasses, ruderal species, species of drier sites) within fens and alters the microtopography of the fen surface. Conclusions Mowing can enhance species richness and the presence of rich fen specialists in transformed sites, but it can lead to fen ecosystem deterioration towards managed meadow communities within sites sustaining many typical fen species and functional characteristics."	14	0	0	0	11	0	16	2019-01-01	WOS:000459825800004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We examined how plant community properties responded to the restoration, and which environmental factors affected the restoration success.LocationRestored peatlands along roadsides at E10, mainland connection to the Lofoten islands, northern Norway.MethodsThe restored area originally consisted of poor to intermediate Sphagnum-dominated natural peatlands. Restoration consisted of stripping and stockpiling the topmost (30cm) peat. The peat was stored for 1-2yr before redistribution, with no further hydrological management. We conducted first time analyses of plant community properties 8 and 9yr after restoration. We recorded vegetation and environmental variables in 108 plots distributed between 18 transects running from the road edge over the restored area to the undisturbed peatland. Undisturbed peatland was used as target for successful restoration. We used CCA and ANOVA to test the effect of restoration on species composition and richness.ResultsThe ordination showed that species composition still differed significantly between restored and undisturbed plots, indicating incomplete restoration after 8 and 9yr. Soil moisture, pH, slope and microtopography were the most important environmental factors for species composition. Polytrichum mosses had a high percentage cover in restored (30%) compared to undisturbed control plots (1%). Linear regression showed that peatland species decreased in abundance with increasing depth of Polytrichum cushions.ConclusionThe low soil moisture level in the restored areas is most likely limiting the establishment of Sphagnum mosses, considered as key species of the typical peatland environment. Thus, the restoration method studied here must be improved to increase the soil moisture by raising the water table or reducing drainage. This should be done through reducing storage time of the peat before redistribution, and minimizing slopes and heterogeneity of the microtopography of the restored area."	11	0	0	0	6	0	12	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700010	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Plant communities were evaluated for four growing seasons, one before and three after management treatment implementation.ResultsGlyphosate reduced non-native grass cover for three growing seasons following application and non-native forbs for one growing season. Glyphosate led to significant increases in non-native forb cover, more than double pre-existing values 2 and 3yr after application. Native species abundance and diversity were more negatively impacted by glyphosate on sites with higher abundance and diversity prior to management treatments. Low frequency cutting over 2yr did not consistently control non-native species, steam reduced non-native grass cover at the most heavily invaded site.ConclusionsSite-specific conditions must be considered to develop effective control methods for non-native species. No treatment effectively re-established native grassland communities. Glyphosate application reduced non-native grasses, but not non-native forbs. When native forbs were abundant prior to management, glyphosate reduced them. Steam may have potential and should be further investigated.

How did species composition change after nearly five decades? Did ungulates facilitate the spread of ruderal species and supress endangered species? Did dispersal strategies play a role in these processes?Location: KrumlovWood, SE Czech Republic.Methods: In 2012, we resampled 58 quasi-permanent vegetation plots first surveyed in the 1960s. Between the surveys, 36 plots were enclosed in a game preserve with artificially high density of ungulates (mostly deer, mouflon and wild boar; ca. 55 animals. km(-2)). We analysed the differences in temporal changes between plots inside and outside the game preserve, focusing on species diversity and composition. We assessed species characteristics relevant to grazing to understand compositional changes.Results: Ungulates significantly increased alpha-and gamma-diversity and caused significant vegetation homogenization inside the game preserve. Vegetation homogenization and the increase in species richness resulted from massive enrichment with ruderal species. However, richness of endangered species decreased. Species dispersed by animals internally (endozoochory) increased, while species dispersed externally (epizoochory) or bywind (anemochory) decreased.Conclusions: Contrary to our expectations, our long-term data showed that artificially high ungulate densities substantially increased plant species richness. Apparently, the establishment of ruderal herbs was supported by frequent disturbances and ungulate-mediated dispersal. At the same time, species richness of non-ruderal plants did not change, probably because ungulates hindered the regeneration of woody species and maintained an open forest canopy. In conclusion, high ungulate density led to the spread of ruderal species, which in turn strongly contributed to the observed shift towards nutrient-richer conditions and taxonomicallymore homogenous communities."	24	0	0	0	23	0	27	2017-04-01	WOS:000398083700013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

However, most studies concern semi-arid areas, and the efficiency and importance of facilitation in arid grazed areas is still poorly understood. The goal of this study was to determine to what extent positive interactions among plants could be used as a restoration tool in an arid grazed region (southern Tunisia). In particular, we examined variations in plant interactions, along with water stress, grazing intensity and the type of nurse plant (grass vs chenopod shrub).LocationAcacia tortilis open woodland community of the National Park of Bou-Hedma, Tunisia (33 degrees 30N, 9 degrees 38E).MethodsSurvival of transplants of Acacia was monitored during two growing seasons, with and without herbivores, in the presence/absence of a chenopod shrub and a perennial grass, and in three communities of contrasting water availability. We quantified the importance of biotic interactions and their variation across the community, grazing and neighbour type treatments.ResultsCompetition was the only statistically significant interaction occurring between Acacia seedlings and both neighbours in all water and grazing conditions. The negative effect of neighbours was mostly for light and water. However, competition was important only at the start of the experiment during a relatively wet period, in the wettest community and in the absence of herbivores. Drought stress and disturbance were the most important drivers of target tree survival.ConclusionsFacilitation cannot be used as a tool for ecological restoration in this arid system, mainly because the only available target tree species is too shade-intolerant and drought-tolerant to benefit from neighbours. In addition, the importance of plant-plant interactions vanished due to the overwhelming importance of stress and disturbance. Our study highlights the fact that nurse-based ecological restoration should not be an automatic process, but must be tailored to the species and environment in question."	34	1	0	0	29	0	38	2015-07-01	WOS:000356007400005	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Is vegetation in recently thinned and burned stands more sensitive to changes in the grazing regime?Location: Northeast OR, USA.Methods: We evaluated changes in plant community composition, diversity, heterogeneity and dominance under herbivory by multiple ungulates (cattle, elk, deer) vs ungulate exclusion at sites where trees were recently thinned and a prescribed burn was applied (managed), and in sites that were not thinned or burned in over 40 yr (unmanaged). Plant species diversity was calculated with the Simpsons index and richness as the total number of plant species. We estimated changes in plant community heterogeneity using a measure of taxonomic dissimilarity. Plant dominance was measured as the relative evenness among different plant functional groups (annual and perennial forbs and graminoids, and shrubs, subshrubs and trees).Results: As expected, managed sites displayed more early succession species, such as annual forbs and annual graminoids, while unmanaged sites were dominated by late-succession species such as shrubs, subshrubs and trees. Species richness, particularly of annuals, was strongly reduced when ungulates were excluded from managed sites, and to a lesser extent from unmanaged sites for some perennial plant species. Species diversity decreased to a slightly greater extent with ungulate exclusion at managed sites. Species dominance was not influenced by ungulate exclusion. The effect of ungulate exclusion on plant heterogeneity also depended on forest management. Heterogeneity increased at managed sites and decreased in unmanaged sites with ungulate exclusion. Overall, the change in vegetation composition over time increased with the exclusion of ungulates, particularly at managed sites.Conclusions: The strength and direction of specific vegetation and diversity responses to ungulate exclusion vary with forest management, and the influence of ungulate exclusion on plant succession is more pronounced in recently thinned and burned sites. Management of wild and domestic ungulates thus needs to account for forest management activities that alter vegetation seral stage and increase the sensitivity of vegetation to the ungulate grazing regime."	15	0	0	0	15	0	16	2015-04-29	WOS:000352131500010	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

To compare the effects of sheep grazing and those of late-summer mowing, we asked: do different types of disturbance (grazing and mowing) affect FD; are FD and species diversity positively correlated in both grazed and mown grasslands; do FD and species diversity take different paths in the two disturbance regimes; and are different FD values related to changes in the composition of traits linked to competitive ability, resource acquisition and resistance strategies?LocationGrazed and mown sites in the Central Apennines (Italy).MethodsWe performed redundancy analysis and indicator species analysis to characterize the trait composition of the two disturbance regimes. We calculated FD for each selected trait and a compound FD for multiple traits, using Rao's quadratic entropy index. Differences in FD between disturbance regimes were tested with a nested ANOVA. We performed a regression analysis between FD and species diversity indices under the two disturbance types.ResultsSpecies and functional diversity were positively correlated in both disturbance types. FD was generally less correlated with species diversity variations in mown grasslands than in grazed ones, suggesting that late mowing leads to higher levels of functional redundancy (i.e. to a wider overlap of species functional composition). Late mowing promoted higher species and functional diversities and a wider variety of functional traits in the plant community. Grazing, besides negatively affecting the species diversity of grasslands, reduced their FD by favouring the dominance of traits related to avoidance and tolerance strategies.ConclusionThe continuation of late mowing is recommended to preserve the richness and variability of functional groups and the ecosystem functioning of sub-Mediterranean grasslands."	37	3	0	0	36	0	43	2014-11-05	WOS:000342839200007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Can NDVI be used to reliably assess seasonal changes in aboveground plant biomass? Location The south plain of Bylot Island, an Arctic tundra ecosystem north of Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada (73 degrees 08N, 80 degrees 00W). Methods Using plant data collected every 2wk throughout the summer in 1991, 19931996 and 20062008, we assessed the relationship between four NDVI indices (AVHRR satellite data at 1-km2 spatial resolution) and the date of peak nitrogen concentration in wetland graminoid plants, which represents seasonal variability in plant quality. We also examined the relationship between NDVI and the seasonal changes in aboveground live plant biomass. Results Three out of the four NDVI metrics that we tested were significantly related to date of peak nitrogen concentration. The strongest relationship was found with the date at which NDVI values reached 50% of their annual maximum (r2=0.87). We also found a positive exponential relationship between NDVI and aboveground biomass of plants (r2=0.58), though this relationship was strongest early in the growing season. Conclusions NDVI can be used as a proxy to determine date of peak nitrogen concentration in some tundra plants, and can thus be a reliable measure of the yearly changes in the timing of the availability of high quality food for herbivores. To a lesser extent, NDVI can also be used to assess seasonal change in plant biomass. This study provides additional support for the use of broad-scale satellite-derived NDVI to assess seasonal changes in habitat quality for herbivores."	36	2	0	0	28	0	42	2013-04-03	WOS:000315690500019	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Persistence increased with time since rehabilitation for five species with < 25% of individuals in three species surviving in the youngest stand. For equivalent crown size, average lignotuber circumferences were 50% smaller at restored sites and this probably accounted for their higher post-fire mortality. Apart from differences in the age of plants, restored sites had lower soil penetrability than natural sites, which may have restricted rootstock development. A tradeoff favoring a higher crown volume to lignotuber size ratio was apparent in nine of the ten species with greater crown volumes (by 37%) and smaller lignotubers (by 36%) in restored sites. Two resprouting species for which crown seed store was quantified had much higher fecundity in restored sites.ConclusionsFires reduced resprouter persistence in restored sites owing to poor development/insufficient size of lignotubers. Further management after fires is required, including application of resprouter seeds/seedlings on restored topsoil, transplanting adult resprouters (where viable) from natural areas ahead of the mining front. Low intensity/patchy fires are recommended on long unburnt sites. Resprouter survival would have likely been much greater in the first place if a deeper sandy soil profile was rehabilitated, thereby providing a more suitable medium for lignotuber development."	12	0	0	0	10	0	12	2009-10-01	WOS:000269455100006	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Individual dataloggers were positioned in areas spanning a range of vegetation structure; three calorimeters and three pyrometers were placed with each thermocouple. We also deployed individual calorimeter-pyrometer pairs. Sites were burned, after which we compared methods for characterizing fire, particularly the ability of pyrometers and calorimeters to predict values derived from thermocouples.Results: Pyrometers best predicted peak 1-minute mean temperatures and were least successful at estimating maximums. Calorimeters were associated with the number of minutes maximum temperatures exceeded 60 degrees C, but were damaged at high residence times and inconsistent at low temperatures. Both pyrometers and calorimeters detected site and treatment differences in fire intensities. These analyses and logistic considerations give pyrometers an edge over calorimeters in situations where dataloggers are impractical. Mechanical pre-treatments to fire altered fire parameters. Mowing reduced fire temperatures but had different effects on areas burned; this was related to the length of time elapsed between mowing and burning. Subcanopy felling increased both fire coverage and temperatures.Conclusion: Pyrometers outperformed calorimeters as a cheap method for describing relative temperature regimes that are a function of both temperature and residence time. Pyrometers were able to demonstrate how mechanical treatments applied prior to prescribed burning altered fire parameters.

Turfs were cut at three different depths, creating a gradient from organic to mineral soils. Germination and establishment of A. montana were negatively correlated with turf cutting depth. The removal of organic matter resulted in a major decrease in organic fraction of the soil and its nutrients. It also resulted in a considerable decrease in moisture content and humic acids. Additional liming after turf cutting increased germination and establishment in all plots and at all depths. Germination experiments under controlled conditions in a climate chamber revealed a significantly higher germination at low aluminium/calcium (Al:Ca) ratios. High Al:Ca ratios resulted in poor germination, suggesting Al toxicity. Addition of humic acids increased germination, even at high Al:Ca ratios, suggesting immobilization of Al by humic acids. It is concluded that turf cutting can have a marked effect on the success of heathland restoration. It results in the intended removal of the eutrophic layer but also in the unintentional removal of much of the buffering mechanisms and/or Al immobilizing compounds.

A coherent piece of turf and soil was transferred from 600 m to 170 m a.s.l., corresponding to an increase in temperature of ca. 2.8 K. The vegetation was monitored by recording cover and counting individuals one year before the translocation and continued for the subsequent seven years. For comparison, a control plot that had also been translocated but remained at 600 m was monitored. Four of eight species with a montane distribution in Europe showed a constant degree of cover during the investigation period (Nardus stricta, Poa chaixii, Polygonatum verticillatum, Potentilla erecta). In contrast, another four montane species declined in cover or died out (Arnica montana, Meum athamanticum, Hypericum maculatum, Galium harcynicum). None of these species declined on the control plot. It is argued that the species' responded individualistically to the site factors that had changed with the translocation to low altitude. A direct effect of enhanced temperature was probably the reason for the decline of only one species (Meum athamanticum). Reduced humidity might be the reason for the extinction of two moisture demanding species (Viola palustris, Succisa pratensis). The biomass of the plot increased by increased growth of one of the matrix species (Festuca rubra), probably due to elevated nutrient mineralization. Many low growing species responded indirectly to the reduced light availability; caused by an increased level of competition for light (e.g. Galium harcynicum). Increased slug herbivory at low altitude resulted in the extinction of Arnica montana. At the end of the investigation period, the similarity in species composition to the initial state was only 45%, indicating that the community had changed into a different plant association.

We analysed vegetation dynamics in Tierra del Fuego steppes using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data provided by advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar satellite. Our objective, at a regional scale, was to analyse the spatial variability of NDVI dynamics in relation to parent material and geographic location, representing the fertility and climate gradients respectively; at a local scale, it was to analyse the inter-annual variability associated with climate and its relation with sheep production indices. The general pattern of NDVI dynamics was analysed with Principal Component Analysis. We found that the geographic location was more important than landscape type in explaining NDVI dynamics despite the fact that the variation in landscape type reflects a fertility gradient strongly associated with floristic composition and secondary productivity. Discriminant Analysis was performed to identify the variables that better distinguish geographic units. The Northern region (with the lowest precipitation and the highest temperatures) had lower NDVI values over the year. In the Central region, NDVI reached the highest value of the season, surpassing both other regions. The Southern region (the coldest and moistest) had its growth pattern displaced towards the summer. For the Central region we analysed 10 years of monthly NDVI data with PCA. We found that precipitation from August to December and winter temperature are the most important determinants of overall NDVI values. Lamb production was correlated with spring and early summer NDVI values. Sheep mortality is affected by low NDVI values in late summer and high annual amplitude.

Two blocks of land, which were farmed commercially until 1990, have been bought in an attempt to link existing patches of heathland and acid grassland, thus creating a larger area for conservation. This paper discusses methods for the creation of acid grasslands. Previous studies of the arable soils in these fields identified three constraints -a depauperate seed bank, a high pH and vigorous growth of ruderal species after the fields were abandoned. Accordingly, experiments were set up to test the effects of (1) adding seed of species typical of acid grasslands and (2) adding amendments (elemental sulphur, litter of Pteridium aquilinum and pine chippings) to acidify the soil. The results confirmed that ruderal growth was high on unamended plots, but this could be reduced by addition of acidic amendments. Where the cover of ruderals was reduced, the cover of the sown species increased. The sown species colonized adjacent unsown subplots naturally and this was most pronounced where the acidity had been reduced by treatment. The most effective treatment was 21 S/ha, which gave the optimal reduction in soil pH, controlled ruderal growth and provided a reasonable cover of the sown species. The addition of Pteridium litter or pine chippings gave good establishment of sown species, but control of the ruderals was less effective."	9	0	0	0	7	0	10	2000-05-01	WOS:000208472200013	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The population dynamics and reproductive strategies of two rare wet heathland species, Gentiana pneumonanthe and Rhynchospora, were studied in experimental permanent plots in a wet heathland near Bremen, NW Germany, to assess how effective sod cutting and mowing are in promoting these species. In one experiment, small plots (0.25 m2 - 4 m2) were sod-cut or mown; in the second, one large plot 30 mx 50m) was sod-cut. The development of the vegetation and the number of shoots of the two target species were recorded annually. Sod cutting lead to the highest shoot numbers of Gentiana in the long run, whilst mowing was more effective at the beginning of the experiment. Seedlings and adult shoots slowly became more and more abundant after sod cutting. In contrast, Rhynchospora soon formed closed stands after sod-cutting, first through seed germination and then through fast clonal growth of the established individuals. Moist soil or short inundations promoted the germination and seedling establishment of Gentiana, whereas drought negatively affected seedling recruitment. Long periods of inundation severely reduced the population at first, but high numbers of seedlings were found in the following growing season. For the disturbance-dependent Gentiana and Rhynchospora, the availability of gaps within the vegetation is of crucial importance. To promote existing populations, we suggest small-scale sod cuttings which create gaps without disturbing existing flowering individuals too much. For degenerated stands of wet heathland we recommend large-scale sod cutting to activate the seed bank. Additionally, seed introduction may be helpful to encourage the development of a wet heathland with characteristic floristic composition."	14	0	0	0	12	0	16	1999-05-01	WOS:000208472000017	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Wetlands have always been of particular significance for mankind. While originally attractive as hunting grounds, they were later cultivated and modified from sinks into sources. Today, great efforts are being made to restore disturbed or destroyed wetland areas. Different models and goals for wetland restoration exist. From a global point of view, reduction of climatically relevant trace gas emissions is relevant, especially in the case of fens. Regionally and locally, the creation of retention basins for water and compounds or the establishment of characteristic fen species and communities may have high priority. In order to avoid goal conflicts, nature development plans are required which consider not just the wetland to be restored, but the entire catchment area. Such plans should include spatially and temporally differentiated recommendations for implementation of restoration measures and a proper land use system. When it comes to defining concrete aims, the participation of local people should be encouraged. Rewetting and oligotrophication are the most common approaches to boost biodiversity in fen ecosystems in Central and Western Europe. Rewetting includes both quantitative and qualitative aspects, requiring quantitative hydrological models and chemical analyses of the groundwater in the region. In addition, re-introduction of species is often necessary, at least in heavily fragmented cultural landscapes. Transfer of hay from donor areas to severely damaged, seed-depleted peatland to restore fen meadows, was successful. However, despite short-term successes, complete restoration of wetland areas requires a long period of time."	114	3	0	0	82	0	131	1999-05-01	WOS:000208472000012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	YES

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fire, cattle grazing, and their interaction on structural traits and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the tussock grass Saccharum angustifolium, and its temporal dynamics in a subhumid grassland.LocationGrasslands of the Eastern Hills, Uruguay.MethodsWe set three blocks (four plots of 300 m2 each) in a homogeneous grazed area dominated by S. angustifolium within a protected area. Each block presented the combinations that emerged from the two levels of cattle grazing (grazed/ungrazed) and burning (burned/unburned) factors. The experimental burning was carried out in the spring. Clump volume, number of flowering culms, NDVI of S. angustifolium, and soil variables were measured for 2 years.ResultsBurning efficiency (plant biomass burned of the total available) was 82%, burn intensity ranged from 178-610 kW m-1, and the soil temperature increased 40% compared with pre-fire measurements. The volume of S. angustifolium clumps decreased with fire, and the difference between burned-unburned plots decreased with time. The burned-ungrazed treatment increased the number of S. angustifolium flowering culms. NDVI of S. angustifolium clumps increased 50% with fire, and then decreased with time. Soil temperature was higher in burned treatments, and moisture was higher in unburned treatments on some dates. Bulk density, for the 0-5-cm depth, was 9% higher in burned than in unburned plots irrespective of grazing.ConclusionsOur results provide new data in favor of the management practice carried out by ranchers in Uruguayan grasslands dominated by S. angustifolium. Our data complement the evidence that a fire-grazing interaction can maintain grasslands in different phases of a stable state. Our results constitute a useful contribution for the managers/authorities of the protected area, and can be extrapolated to other tussock grass-dominated grassland areas.Dynamic scheme of alternative phases and states promoted by the fire x grazing interaction proposed for a Uruguayan grassland dominated by the clump-forming grass Saccharum angustifolium.image"	1	0	0	0	1	0	2	2024-07-24	WOS:001270858400001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Knowing under what environmental and management conditions direct seeding vs seedling planting benefit different species could improve restoration practice.MethodsWe compared seed emergence to planted-seedling survival among perennial herbaceous species commonly used in restoration across eight experimental restoration sites on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We used linear models to assess relationships between emergence and survival among species, and to assess the effects of site climate and seeding pre-treatments on those relationships.ResultsWe found that among species, emergence was positively correlated with survival in the cooler sites, meaning that species with high emergence also had high survival and vice versa, but had no relationship in the hottest sites. Furthermore, pre-treatments to enhance soil moisture in seeded plots, specifically microtopography (pits) and mulch, also resulted in positive relationships between emergence and survival among species, while seeding without additional soil pre-treatments did not. Seedling planting cost 14 times as much as direct seeding alone, dropping to nine times as much when pre-treatments were combined with seeding.ConclusionsTaken together, these results suggest that investments in seedling planting at hotter dryland sites, or in creating microtopography or mulching prior to seeding across sites, are likely to promote establishment success compared to simple seeding methods in degraded dryland ecosystems. These findings also identify opportunities for hybrid seeding and planting approaches that balance tradeoffs between risk and cost, respectively.Restoration practitioners face a tradeoff between low cost but risky seeding vs expensive but more reliable seedling planting to meet revegetation goals. We show that investment in seedling planting, rather than seeding, is most beneficial at hotter sites, and that creating microtopography or mulching prior to seeding is necessary to achieve similar outcomes to seedling planting in degraded dryland ecosystems.image"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2023-12-21	WOS:001119076800001	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Hiking trails are an extremely common feature in natural areas that enable recreational use, but trail construction and use can also facilitate the spread of non-native species by altering trailside conditions, creating disturbances, and acting as a conduit for non-native propagules to be carried into the backcountry.Location: Powdermill Nature Reserve, Southwestern Pennsylvania, USA.Methods: We tested how distance from trailhead and trailside affected the under story plant cover and abundance and light and soil environment by establishing study plots at varying distances from the trailhead along perpendicular transects from the trailside.Results: We found that non-native plant cover decreased with distance from the trail head, with the majority occurring within 1 km of the trailhead, while non-native cover increased by as much as 12% moving away from the trailside and toward the forest interior. Total species richness and diversity decreased with increasing distance from the trailhead and per-species mean cover increased. Total cover decreased in plots with higher light levels.Conclusions: Our results suggest that hiking trails could be acting as a conduit for the spread of non-native plants, with the greatest effect occurring near the trailhead where early detection and future management efforts could be concentrated. The measurable increase in non-native cover moving away from the trailside is potentially a result of trails being constructed in an already-invaded forest, with the effects of trail construction or active management reducing non-native cover at the immediate trailside."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2023-08-21	WOS:000948659200001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Our aim was to reveal how increased N availability altered plant composition in boreal permafrost peatlands with dense vascular plants (>50%). Location Greater Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. Methods A nitrogen addition experiment with four N addition levels (0, 3, 6, and 12 g N m(-2) year(-1)) was conducted in a poor fen in the continuous permafrost zone with vascular plant coverage above 60%. Plant diversity, community composition, and above-ground biomass were investigated after four, six, and eight years of N addition. Results Nitrogen addition decreased species richness and diversity but enhanced total above-ground biomass. Plant height determined the plants' responses to N addition, and the magnitudes increased with N addition level and experimental duration. The relative coverage of high-stature (>50 cm) species increased, but the relative coverage of low-stature (<50 cm) species decreased with elevating N addition levels. When N addition proceeded, the relative coverage and above-ground biomass of tall deciduous shrubs and nitrophilous grasses increased, whereas the relative coverage and above-ground biomass of dwarf evergreen shrubs, mosses, and lichens declined. Regardless of N addition levels, cryptogams (i.e., mosses and lichens) and a dwarf evergreen shrub (Chamaedaphne calyculata) disappeared after eight-year N addition. Conclusions Cryptogams and dwarf evergreen shrubs are highly vulnerable to increased N availability, and N enrichment-induced biodiversity loss, especially the disappearance of cryptogams, will deteriorate ecosystem structure and function in boreal permafrost peatlands."	6	1	0	0	4	0	7	2022-11-13	WOS:000878008000001	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Do these parameters operate predominantly on a fine or a community scale? Location White Carpathian Mountains, SE Czech Republic. Methods We compared 16 grasslands restored on former arable land with 9 well-preserved reference grasslands. We sampled cover of plant species in plots of 2 m x 2 m (community scale) in which four 20 cm x 20 cm subplots (fine scale) were nested. We quantified fine-scale heterogeneity as the mean Sorensen dissimilarity index among the species composition of the subplots. To characterize site conditions, we analyzed soil properties, above-ground plant biomass and its nutrient content. Results Restored grasslands had a lower number of plant species at both the community and fine scales. Species number at the community scale was positively associated with the species number at the fine scale (irrespective of grassland type), but was not associated with fine-scale heterogeneity. This indicates the importance of fine-scale biotic interactions for overall species diversity. In support of this, in both grassland types, the species number was negatively associated with the cover of grasses, but only at the fine scale. Total cover (but not the biomass) was lower in restored grasslands, and was positively related with species number, particularly in restored grasslands. This indicates that the lower species number in the restored grasslands mainly resulted from deteriorated abiotic conditions. Such deterioration of the plant environment can be attributed particularly to the soil of the restored, formerly plowed grasslands. They had a lower soil organic matter content and a higher proportion of fine soil particles (silt and clay), indicating reduced soil water availability. The lower soil N content of restored grasslands was also reflected in the nutrient content of plant biomass, where lower N:P and N:K ratios indicated a limitation of plant growth by N-supply. Conclusion The species number was generally driven by fine-scale biotic interactions, which operated similarly in both grassland types. The reduced number of plant species in restored grasslands is the result of several factors among which altered soil conditions in the former arable land appears to be highly important."	4	0	0	0	3	0	4	2022-06-01	WOS:000799977800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We asked: (a) does past land use alter composition in riparian vs upland areas in wet tropical forest; (b) which vegetation life forms characterize riparian zones; and (c) what is the composition and quantity of leaf litter in riparian zones compared to uplands? Location Riparian and upland locations in tropical wet forest, Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP), Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Methods Stratified random sampling was conducted in riparian and upland areas of LFDP with high and low past land use. Understorey vegetation life form composition and cover were sampled in plots. Leaf-litter species composition and components were estimated with collecting baskets placed throughout riparian zones and uplands. Results Ferns and lianas were more abundant in riparian areas than uplands. Ordination of species composition groups was distinct for riparian and upland areas with different past land use when based on leaf litter, but this ordination pattern was not as clear in plot vegetation. Conclusion Characterized by greater presence of ferns and lianas, riparian zones had higher species richness values and greater leaf litter biomass. Distinct leaf-litter species composition within riparian and upland areas may result from a combination of different land-use histories, various plant types, and environmental conditions.

Biomass production is driven by the temporal and spatial variability in precipitation, but our understanding of how precipitation variability mediates grazing effects on biomass production is still fragmented. Along a 600-km precipitation gradient we extracted biomass data to ask the questions: (a) what are the effects of grazing intensity on biomass production; (b) does grazing intensity interact with plant species richness to affect biomass production; and (c) how do plant functional groups respond to grazing and precipitation? Location Mongolia. Methods Biomass was sampled along 15 grazing intensity transects within the precipitation gradient over two consecutive years. We modeled spatial variability in above-ground plant biomass using mixed-effects models. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were combined with field-sampled biomass data to correct for inter-annual precipitation variation. The effects of species richness were modeled with respect to possible interactions with grazing intensity, and the composition of plant functional groups was modeled with respect to possible interactions between grazing intensity and precipitation. Results Biomass was negatively correlated with grazing intensity and this effect increased as precipitation increased. Biomass was positively correlated with species richness in both years, but the strength of this effect and the interaction between species richness and grazing intensity differed between 2014 and 2015 in line with highly variable precipitation between both years. The plant functional groups grasses, sedges, legumes, wormwood and forbs had contrasting responses to grazing and precipitation. Conclusion Biomass production in drylands is more vulnerable to changes in precipitation variability and grazing intensities in relatively moist and productive rangelands than in dry and unproductive ones.

They are common in coastal environments and may thus threaten island biodiversity. While their effects are well known on soils, plant communities and associated fauna, the effects ofCarpobrotuscontrol on vegetation recovery are poorly documented. The aim of the paper is to describe plant community trajectories afterCarpobrotusremoval. Location Bagaud: a 58-ha Mediterranean island, southern France. Methods Carpobrotusand its litter were removed in 2011-2012. Follow-up controls of germinations and resprouts were carried out from then on. Plant communities were surveyed every year two years before and seven years afterCarpobrotusremoval: on two ca. 0.5-ha sites (one coastal and one inland) and in three native plant communities used as potential references. Differences in resprouts, vegetation parameters, and Bray-Curtis similarity indices between years were tested. Plant community dynamics was studied through a non-metric multidimensional scaling and two recovery indices. Results The removal ofCarpobrotusand its litter led to the recovery of diverse native plant communities. To preventCarpobrotusreturn and ensure success, follow-up controls were necessary for a period of at least seven years, but the amount of work decreased with time. The plant community recovering on the coastal site quickly reached a composition and structure similar to that of non-invaded coastal vegetation, although some slow-growing native species remain underrepresented (e.g.,Crithmum maritimumandLimonium pseudominutum). The plant community recovering on the inland site was still very different from the surrounding matorral vegetation because of its slow colonization dynamics, particularly in the presence of competitive herbaceous species.

However, positive correlations between native and alien plant diversity observed in recent studies could mask the displacement of particular native species and functional groups or the negative effects of particular alien species. We asked: do alien species alter the species composition or proportions of growth forms in grasslands? Do particular alien species decrease native plant diversity? Location South Australian grasslands. Methods We performed RDA ordination on growth form abundances or Hellinger-transformed species abundances obtained from plot-based surveys, constrained by alien species richness and cumulative cover. Control variables (climate, soil, land use and geographic space) were partialled out. We related individual alien species abundances to native richness, diversity and cover. We tested for functional differences between coexisting growth forms using trait hypervolumes. Results While alien richness and cover explained just 2% of variance in native species composition (control variables 17%), aliens explained 18% of variance in native growth form abundance (control variables 33%), and were associated with increased herb and grass cover. Few individual alien species were associated with strong negative or positive differences in native richness, diversity or cover: correlations followed a Gaussian distribution with near-zero mean. Trait hypervolumes differed between native and alien herbs with an overlap of 0.44, indicating substantial, but not complete, functional differences. Conclusions Given environmental context, alien cover was a good predictor of native herb and grass abundance relative to woody growth forms, but not of species composition per se. While the direction of causality is equivocal, aliens may facilitate native grasses and herbs, and niche complementarity may be involved. Due to functional redundancy across the species pool, the resulting species composition appears to be spatially contingent. Importantly for management, we identify alien species associated with reduced native diversity."	8	0	0	0	7	0	8	2019-08-04	WOS:000479694100001	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location La Crau, southeastern France. Methods We set up a split-plot experiment testing the effects of fire season (winter, summer) and grazing on plant cover, inflorescence number, seed set and germination of Brachypodium retusum in traditionally grazed grasslands. We further analyzed plant species composition and diversity in vegetation releves. The same fire treatments were tested in a second experiment in long-term grazing exclosures. Results Brachypodium retusum showed a rapid post-fire recovery, but other species of the associated plant community, in particular annuals, recovered as fast or even faster. Fire increased Brachypodium retusum inflorescence production and seed set per inflorescence and this effect was stronger in the summer fire treatment. At the community level, fire significantly increased species richness, evenness and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in the second post-fire season and again, the summer fire effect was stronger. Grazing exclusion for two seasons had only a small effect on Brachypodium retusum and the associated plant community. The effect of both fire treatments on Brachypodium retusum was similar in long-term exclosures. In these exclosures, fire resulted in a community shift towards the species composition of traditionally grazed steppes. Conclusions The concomitant positive effects of experimental burning on Brachypodium retusum reproduction and on plant diversity of Mediterranean steppe vegetation suggest that the system is adapted to fire as an important driver of community composition. Annual species surviving as seeds are as successful in post-fire recovery as perennial resprouters. Prescribed burning may be an alternative strategy to restore community structure in abandoned (ungrazed) steppes showing a decline in typical grassland species after several years of grazing abandonment."	25	0	0	0	21	0	25	2019-01-01	WOS:000459825800013	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Each plot was matched to nearby plots that were either intact bog or remained afforested. Principal Response Curves were used to highlight the main axes of vegetation variation and test whether plant community trajectories in the restoration area differed from intact bog. The following restoration outcomes were assessed: floristic similarity to bog vegetation; and moisture, fertility and acidity, as inferred from vegetation using Ellenberg indicator values.Results: In the 6 years after restoration began, vegetation developed towards bog-like conditions. In the subsequent 8 years, overall vegetation change stalled, and spatial variability increased, reflecting diverging trajectories in wetter and drier parts of the site. Ellenberg's F-values implied significant re-wetting in the restoration area, reaching moisture levels similar to intact bog. Other restoration outcomes progressed in wetter microsites and areas (furrows and flat ground), but stalled in drier locations (plough-ridges and steeper slopes).Conclusions: Overall moisture conditions, as indicated by plants, have recovered. However, restoration progress has stalled in drier areas, where additional management may be needed. Long-term vegetation monitoring has helped clarify barriers to recovery and the management needed to overcome them. The value of such monitoring schemes in guiding restoration should be reflected in their wider implementation, within an adaptive management framework."	56	0	0	0	44	0	59	2018-04-01	WOS:000430912500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

What recommendations regarding the sustainable management of Baltic Sea beaches can be proposed?Location: Southern Baltic Sea beaches in Germany.Methods: In this study, the species composition of vascular plants on beaches with differing accessibility to tourists was analysed at the southwest Baltic Sea coast. In total, 894 vegetation plots were evaluated in order to determine vegetation changes along the sea-inland gradient due to different levels of human accessibility at beaches. Releves were conducted as repeated transects from the beach ridge to the shore. Shifts in vegetation characteristics due to different levels of tourism access were analysed at the level of plant communities and plant species traits.Results: Species richness did not differ significantly between the levels of accessibility. Vegetation cover significantly increased with distance to the shore and was highest in the upper shore area of closed beaches (52.0 +/- 2.7%). Corresponding to the increase in beach access, we observed an increase in ruderal species and a decrease in typical beach species of the vegetation class Honckenyo-Elymetea. Tourism access and distance to the shoreline had a decisive influence on the distribution of plants with selected plant traits. In particular, at accessible sites, a loss of plants with leaves having high scleromorphy was recorded.Conclusions: Increased beach access results in a loss of typical beach plant species. Changes in vegetation characteristics are considered to alter the function of the beach ecosystem. Based on these results, we derived spatially differentiated management measures for excluding the most sensitive beach areas from tourism."	9	1	0	0	5	0	12	2016-04-01	WOS:000374545600007	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Assembling productive communities of native grass and legume species: finding the right mix	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE	NA	19	1	NA	NA	111	121	NA	10.1111/avsc.12200	Article	JAN 2016	2016	"Question: Native species have the potential to provide productive, drought-resistant communities for seeded rangelands and ecological restoration. Little is known, however, about how to identify multispecies mixtures with optimal levels of productivity and stress resistance from the thousands of possible community configurations. Here we examine if empirical models can be used to predict highly productive community configurations of seven native grasses and legumes in controlled conditions from the very large pool of possible communities, and which basic measure of community structure best predicts function.Location: Greenhouses in Saskatchewan, Canada.Methods: We used a greenhouse experiment, where established communities varied in species and functional group richness, evenness, species and functional group identity, following a response surface design. We measured community productivity and evaluated the predictive power of a range of empirical models linking diversity and productivity.Results: Productivity increased with increased functional dispersion, relative growth rate and decreased competitive effect. Selection effects were evident, with the abundance and occurrence of particular species or functional groups and plant traits also linked to increased productivity. Among the strongest predictors of productivity were the presence and abundance of perennial C-3 grasses (particularly Pascopyrum smithii), likely because of the high early relative growth rate and strong competitive effect of those species.Conclusions: We compiled and compared the ability of a range of empirical models to predict high-productivity community configurations, and tested the accuracy of the best models in a confirmatory experiment. The relationship between predicted and observed productivity was significantly correlated in the confirmatory experiment, and demonstrates that under controlled conditions, basic measures of community structure can predict community function. This approach has potential, but variability within treatments may limit the accuracy of results. The models developed can be used as a screening tool, narrowing the search window for high functioning seed mixtures for use in ecological restoration."	10	0	0	0	7	0	11	2016-02-03	WOS:000368074600013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Are landscape composition and landscape heterogeneity important determinants of plant diversity in these meadows?Location: Southwestern Switzerland.Methods: We surveyed vascular plant species in six traditionally and six sprinkler-irrigated hay meadows. Plant species were divided into grassland specialists and generalists. Individual landscape traits were assessed in circular areas with radii of 50 and 100 m around each meadow in a field survey. Aerial photographs were used to measure the percentage area covered by different habitat types in the present and prior to the installation of sprinklers at the same spatial scale as in the field surveys. The potential effects of irrigation technique and present-day landscape features on the plant diversity and species composition of hay meadows were examined with GLM and NMDS.Results: Landscape composition was more diverse for traditionally than for sprinkler-irrigated meadows, but did not differ prior to the installation of sprinklers. Total plant species richness and the number of specialists were negatively affected by the distance to the closest haystack. Generalists were positively influenced by a variety of different small-scale landscape traits in the surroundings, whereas the percentage area covered by woodland had a negative effect. Finally, hay meadows irrigated with sprinklers had an increased number of generalist plant species.Conclusions: This study showed that the small-scale surroundings, and to some extent the type of irrigation, are important for the conservation of plant diversity of these meadows. Furthermore, the study suggests that the installation of sprinklers was associated with a homogenization of the landscape, which facilitates land use. Extensive management should be promoted by compensation payments for farmers to prevent intensification."	2	0	0	0	3	0	3	2015-04-29	WOS:000352131500009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Location Upper Galilee, northern Israel. Methods Experimental treatments involved two levels of grazing intensity and protection from grazing for different time periods. Sampling methods included a quantitative method, involving harvesting of vegetative biomass from small (25x25cm) quadrats within 10x10m exclosures, and a qualitative method, involving recording presence only of plant species within the same exclosures. Results Both sampling methods revealed differences between protected vegetation and grazed vegetation; however they were not comparable in the way they described differences in species composition between grazed and ungrazed vegetation, and neither method could discriminate between the two levels of grazing intensity. The discrepancy between the two methods in the number and identity of species recorded ranged from 37% to 51% per plot for species recorded by both methods. Conclusions Qualitative sampling highlighted species that are indicative of protection from grazing; however it did not satisfactorily describe alteration in community composition, since the studied grassland is characterized by changing dominance of common species among treatments, instead of major species turnover. Suitable methods of data collection and monitoring will depend primarily on manpower and the specific characteristics of the studied community."	4	0	0	0	2	0	6	2013-07-10	WOS:000319885000015	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Anaga Rural Park, Tenerife Island, Canary Islands (Spain). Methods We evaluated plant species composition, diversity and structure (frequencies of functional groups based on growth form and bare ground) for three goat grazing regimes using 63 permanent point-quadrat transects. The effect of orientation (N vs S slope) was also analysed. Data were collected in the spring during each year from 2001 to 2005. Results Grazing regime affected the studied functional groups differently. The frequency of annual grasses was higher in the heavily grazed areas, shrubs decreased sharply from abandoned to heavily grazed areas, and shrub legumes appeared less abundant in the lightly grazed transects. An interaction between grazing regime and orientation affected some functional groups. Grazing led to higher plant diversity, and did not affect the frequency of bare ground or native and endemic species. There were no strong differences in species composition among the three grazing regimes. However, species composition in abandoned areas was characterized by a higher abundance of late-successional and endemic shrub species, while herbaceous species typical of pastures were more common in the grazed areas. Conclusions Grazing regimes noticeably affect the composition and structure of the vegetation of semi-natural ecosystems but do not result in a complete turnover in species composition. Goat grazing is beneficial for maintaining traditional open agroecosystems; however, controlling the grazing intensity can avoid negative effects on the vegetation, particularly the sharp reduction in shrub and palatable species. Some abandoned areas should be maintained to preserve grazing-sensitive endemic shrub species in these Canarian semi-natural ecosystems."	21	1	0	0	15	2	21	2013-01-01	WOS:000312159400009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Location Northwestern Switzerland. Methods We quantified the amount of illegally dumped garden waste at 20 sites over 1 yr and compared the soil conditions, species richness and abundance of plants in the ground vegetation at disposal sites with those at 20 control sites in urban deciduous forests. Results We found that illegal garden waste dumping frequently occurs in urban forests. At single sites, 0.112.5 m3 (mean: 2.6 m3) garden waste was dumped per month, resulting in a total annual amount of 2.235.8 m3 (mean: 17.8 m3) waste deposited. Thirty-seven of the 163 plant species recorded were not native to Switzerland. All 37 non-native species were recorded in waste disposal sites, but only three of them in control sites. Thus, garden waste dumping sites harboured a larger number of non-native species than control sites, but the two groups of sites did not differ in number of native species. The species composition also differed between disposal and control sites: larger proportions of species typical of disturbed habitats, more therophytes and species with autochorous seed dispersal were recorded in disposal sites than in control sites. Conclusions We provide evidence that numerous non-native horticultural plant species escape from dumping sites and colonize forests. There is an urgent need to increase awareness of garden owners concerning problems associated with illegal garden waste dumping."	40	0	0	0	32	0	42	2012-07-25	WOS:000305936800004	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Plant biomass was collected in five 0.25-m 2 plots per wetland and sorted to species. Soil cores were collected to analyse soil total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). An information-theoretic approach was used to compare mixed effects models considering the association of non-native richness, relative frequency, and biomass with native richness, relative frequency, biomass, C-3 grass relative frequency (a dominant native group), N, P and wetland-type.Results: Non-native richness was negatively correlated with native richness in semi-natural wetlands, but there was no evidence of an association between these variables in highly managed wetlands. Non-native richness increased with increasing soil N in semi-natural wetlands, but not in the highly managed wetlands. Soil P was positively related to non-native frequency in semi-natural wetlands but negatively related in highly managed wetlands. Non-native frequency and biomass were negatively related to relative frequency of C-3 grasses in both management types.Conclusions: Our results indicate that management intensity influences relationships between native and non-native richness.

Is there any adaptive approach to promote revegetation in the shortest time possible and at a low cost?Location: Northeast China.Methods: Considering the climate, soil saline-alkalization and available seed sources, a new approach was adopted to restore vegetation in BSAP, which were formed by the degradation of typical Leymus chinensis grasslands owing to long-term overgrazing. The experimental treatments included no treatment (CK), fencing (F), fencing+inserting cornstalks (FS), fencing+inserting cornstalks+sowing L. chinensis (FSL) and fencing+inserting cornstalks+sowing Puccinellia chinampoensis (FSP). The assumptions behind inserting cornstalks were not only that they would create safe sites for initial revegetation but also that they would enhance seed input by trapping and containing the seeds from seed movement on the BSAP surface.Results: Seed bank shortage was an important factor limiting initial revegetation in BSAP; seed movement on the BSAP surface could provide the necessary seed source if it were contained by effective measures. Vegetation at the sites FS, FSL and FSP was restored well in terms of the above-ground biomass and coverage. Inserted cornstalks acted as safe sites that enhanced the plant survival rate in BSAP; they also enhanced the ability to contain seed movement, thus providing a seed source for initial revegetation. Along with initial revegetation, tussocks around cornstalks can provide better safe sites, which in turn can accelerate subsequent vegetation restoration in BSAP.Conclusions: The approach entails the strategic use of diverse seed sources and the construction of safe sites with agricultural byproducts (cornstalks); therefore, it is a low-cost method and can be used on a widespread scale. The results provide vigorous support in favor of vegetation restoration in BSAP and severely degraded grasslands in the region. In practice, this approach can be used in degraded ecosystems with compacted soil surfaces (including arid and salt-affected soils) to promote revegetation in various regions."	28	7	0	0	20	0	33	2010-02-01	WOS:000273601700005	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Changes in community variables (species richness, Ellenberg values, upland hay meadow community coefficients) were analysed in species-rich, modified species-rich and degraded grassland types. Redundancy Analysis and Generalised Linear Models were used to show the relationship between management practices and soil properties and change in species composition and community variables.Results: Few sites contained the species-rich grassland type, and here forb richness declined. In the modified species-rich type, total and grass species richness increased but Ellenberg N-values also increased. Total and grass species richness increased in the degraded type and the community coefficient increased. Management was weakly related to change in species composition but showed clear relationships with the community variables. Re-establishment of the target species-rich community was more likely with late cutting, in the absence of cattle or prolonged spring grazing, and at lower soil nutrient status.Conclusion: The species-rich community was not maintained but some reversion occurred in degraded grassland.

Are vulnerable plant species able to withstand competition with the surrounding vegetation and maintain viable populations under these circumstances? How do they respond to reinstatement of traditional mowing regimes?Location: Oedelem, northwestern Belgium.Methods: To investigate the effect of reinstatement of the rare perennial Primula vulgaris, demography and adult plant performance were monitored in a grassland verge between 1999 and 2003 under different mowing regimes. Year transitions between life stages were analysed with matrix population models. To disentangle the contributions of the deviations in different life stage transitions to the variation in overall population growth rate, life table response experiments were used.Results: Both management and year had a strong impact on demographic traits of P. vulgaris. If plots were left unmanaged, lower plant performance and declining population growth rates were observed. While population growth rates differed significantly between mowing regimes, mowing of plots only in July did not differ from mowing in July and October in terms of vegetative and reproductive output of adults. Mowing twice a year appeared to be most efficient in increasing population growth rate both by raising recruitment and growth of individuals into large reproductive adults.Conclusions: Large P. vulgaris populations show a good ability to recover from recent abandonment of traditional management regimes. By mowing twice a year, managers are able to target vital rates that are most infuential growth and flowering of adult individuals."	21	0	0	0	19	0	23	2007-12-01	WOS:000250089300007	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Paired grazed and ungrazed plots from central and peripheral locations were compared over 14 yr. Vegetation data from 34 mires in Kielder Forest provided an ordination framework within which vegetation trends were investigated. A gradient from dry moorland/hummock to wet mire/hollow vegetation dominated this framework and may reflect hydrological variability and structural vegetation differences between the mires.Some species were significantly affected by change in grazing intensity and there were differences between the edge and the centre of the mire. Overall vegetation change depended upon the grazing management and the position of the plots such that the removal of sheep grazing decreased the cover of species typical of wet ombrotrophic conditions, but only at the periphery of the mire. The vegetation in one plot became very similar to that of mires elsewhere in Kielder Forest where sheep were removed several decades ago.Cessation of grazing on upland mires is likely to lead to slow structural and species change in vegetation at the mire edge with a long-term loss of ombrotrophic species. The nature conservation significance of these changes will depend upon whether or not management objectives target natural conditions or wish to maximize ombrotrophic vegetation. The context of external factors such as climate and pollution may, however, be more important in determining site condition on the wettest mires."	10	0	0	0	7	0	10	2003-12-01	WOS:000220133300019	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Today, nearly all of these meadows have been abandoned and became rapidly overgrown by deciduous shrub and tree species forming a closed canopy which resulted in a rapid and strong decrease in species numbers of the herb layer. Recent efforts aim to restore overgrown wooded meadows by cutting single shrubs and trees to open the canopy. However, the effects of abandonment as well as of any restoration management in wooded meadows have rarely been documented until now. Mechanisms driving succession after restoration such as the dispersal potential of the respective species over time and space have not been analysed yet. Therefore, a chronosequence was studied which included a traditionally managed wooded meadow, an overgrown meadow which has been abandoned for more than 100 yr and a meadow which was restored 36 yr ago by cutting and is now grazed. We analysed the soil seed bank of the 3 meadows in comparison with the established vegetation and endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep. After abandonment 87% of the typical grassland species vanished from the established vegetation and were replaced by species characteristic of woodland and disturbed grassland communities. The mean number of species decreased from 52 species per plot (4 m2) to 18 species. Mean species number and number of seeds in the seed bank declined significantly from the traditionally managed to the overgrown meadow. Most of the grassland species were assigned to a transient seed bank type while only 1/3 could be classified as having a short-term persistent seed bank. Thus, restoration of wooded meadows cannot rely on the soil seed bank.

The vegetation at each site was subjected to three management treatments (continuous grazing, deferred grazing simulating rotational grazing, and grazing exclusion) in 0.5-ha experimental plots. In spring-summer of 2021-2022, we estimated the species cover composition for each experimental plot, classifying them according to life-forms, and recorded other variables such as vegetation height. The effects of grazing management on life-form and species cover were examined using multivariate analysis of variance, redundancy analysis (RDA), Renyi curve, and diversity through Hill Numbers.Results The results indicate significant effects of grazing treatments on species composition, with grazing exclusion associated with greater average height of vegetation. Additionally, grazing impacts diversity profiles and life-form abundance, with notable differences between PG and HG. Overall, continuous and deferred grazing exhibited higher diversity compared to grazing exclusion, with significant variations in diversity among treatments.Conclusion Grazing exclusion leads to a loss of grassland diversity, while diversity may not fundamentally differ between sites under continuous or deferred grazing.

Financial data of restoration projects are rarely published. To close this gap, we report the cost-benefit analysis of different landscaping methods used in the greening of the outskirts of a factory industrial area. Location: The study area is located in a factory area in Nyiregyhaza, Nyirseg, Hungary. Methods: In this study, we compare the costs of the implementation and maintenance of three different types of grasslands (intensively and extensively managed park lawns and semi-natural grassland, called eco area) and the ecological benefits in terms of vegetation and potential for pollinators. Results: The implementation and maintenance costs of the extensively managed park lawn were more than ten-fold higher than that of the eco area, despite the higher price of native plant material. The construction of the extensive park lawn is the cheapest, but the eco area pays off in ca. 1.5 years compared to it, taking into account the lower maintenance costs. Seven years after implementation, the eco area is the most species-rich, hosting the highest number of natural constituent species, but with similar vegetation cover as in the intensively managed park lawn without costly maintenance. The cover and species richness of legumes and forbs are also higher in the eco area, ensuring a food source for pollinators. Conclusions: Our results support that introducing species-rich and diverse grasslands with native, habitat specialist species as an alternative to traditional landscaping in urban-industrial areas can be economically and ecologically rewarding. The higher costs of planning, plant material, and implementation pay off in a short time due to low maintenance costs and can lead to a win-win situation for nature as well as for the local economy."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2023-12-01	WOS:001105712400001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Plants are adapted to particular fire regimes, made up of components including fire frequency and seasonality. However, burning outside historical regime parameters may impact species recovery and subsequent community assembly. We asked (i) do shrub species respond differently to spring and autumn fires, the primary times for prescribed burns in many temperate regions and (ii) does the use of novel functional groups, based on seed and seed bank traits, allow more robust predictions of response to shifting fire season?Location: Mediterranean-climate southern Australia.Methods: We surveyed 10 common shrub species to examine the impact of fire season on mortality, resprout vigour and seedling recruitment, using three functional groups: fire response (obligate seeder vs resprouter), seed storage (soil- vs canopy-stored), and seed dormancy class [physical (PY) vs morphophysiological (MPD)]. We also analysed individual species to assess species-specific responses.Results: Obligate seeding and canopy seed-storing functional groups were negatively impacted by spring burns, with recruitment levels one third of that observed after autumn burns. For species with soil-stored seed banks, impacts of burn season were mediated by seed dormancy class, with PY species performing worse than their seasonally emerging MPD counterparts. Some individual species responded in stark contrast to others within their functional group.Conclusion: Functional groups widely used to predict recovery, usually based on resprouting response and fire frequency, may not robustly predict responses to some fire factors, such as fire season. Our results highlight the importance that fire seasonality has on species response and potentially subsequent community assembly. We propose utilising multiple functional groups when assessing risk from shifting fire seasonality or when exploring impacts of multiple fire regime elements, and species-focused studies when managing species at high risk of extinction."	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	2023-12-17	WOS:001103051500001	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The aim of this study was to evaluate the plant species composition and vegetation structure of Sphagnum cultivation sites in comparison with near-natural donor sites and rewetted sites without Sphagnum introduction.Location: Central Europe, northwest Germany close to the Dutch-German border.Methods: The treatments (rewetting with and without Sphagnum introduction) and a near-natural donor as a reference were each studied at three different sites. At each site, bryophyte and vascular plant species composition as well as parameters of vegetation structure were sampled in 40 randomly positioned plots of 25 cm x 25 cm.Results: In addition to the highly frequent Sphagnum, several further plant species typical of bogs were introduced. At two cultivation sites, the species composition showed a high degree of similarity to the near-natural donor sites, whereas the third site was more similar to the rewetted sites without the introduction of Sphagnum biomass. Rewetted sites were species-poor in comparison with all other sites. Apart from a high cover of Sphagnum, the vegetation structure at the cultivation sites differed significantly from the near-natural donor sites.Conclusions: Sphagnum cultivation sites can be used to grow donor material for peatland restoration and contribute to species conservation by providing substitute habitat for bog-typical and threatened plant species."	3	0	0	0	3	0	3	2023-08-23	WOS:001045099100001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Improving the management of degraded native temperate grasslands that are grazed by livestock is important to the conservation of this critically endangered ecosystem. Questions remain about the role of grazing in the management of such grasslands, particularly in the face of climate change and given the sensitivity of these systems to inter-annual rainfall variability. Here, we investigate the effect of livestock exclusion on grassland composition.Location: Temperate grassland, Victoria, Australia.Methods: Over 9 years (2009-2017), we monitored plant functional groups in plots open-to-grazing or ungrazed exclusion plots within five fields of degraded native temperate grassland on private land.Results: In the years after grazing had been excluded, we found significant differences in cover between grazed and ungrazed plots for some functional groups (e.g. native perennial graminoids) in some years, but we did not observe long-term divergence in cover or composition of the treatments. At the final monitoring point there were no significant differences in native or exotic species richness between the grazed and ungrazed plots. We show that the years in which differences were observed correspond with the 2010-2011 La Nina high-rainfall event, suggesting that grazing exclusion effects are mediated by rainfall, and are likely to be evident only under certain conditions.Conclusion: In grassy ecosystems already degraded by long-term grazing, excluding grazing has limited potential to shift plant species composition in favour of native dominance. Such grasslands may persist in the medium term in a stable but degraded state with or without continued light to moderate livestock grazing pressure. Hence, managed livestock grazing need not be incompatible with the conservation of degraded temperate grasslands particularly where biomass management is important for the maintenance of faunal habitat. However, improving the function and diversity of these degraded grasslands will seemingly require additional management, including seed addition and experimentation with alternative disturbance regimes."	5	0	0	0	4	0	5	2023-09-25	WOS:001000361800001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

Yet, dispersal is often overlooked as a driving factor, especially on expanding vacant land. Does overcoming dispersal limitation by seeding native species in urban environments and increasing the functional or phylogenetic diversity of the seeding pool increase native plant species diversity and abundance in urban vacant land? Location Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Methods We took an experimental approach to learn how different dimensions of plant biodiversity within a regional species pool augmented via seed additions, can explain variation in community structure over a three-year period. Vacant lots were cleared and manipulated with seeding treatments of high or low phylogenetic and functional diversities from a pool of 28 native species. Establishment success, total native cover and native-species richness were followed and compared to cleared, unseeded control lots as well as unmanipulated lots. Results Seeding increased native plant abundance and richness over uncleared plots, as well as cleared and unseeded control plots. Phylogenetically diverse seed mixtures had greater establishment success than mixtures composed of closely related species. Diversifying seed mixtures increased the likelihood of including species that are better able to establish on vacant land. However, there were no differences in varying levels of either functional or phylogenetic diversity. Conclusions Augmenting the regional species pool via diverse seed mixtures can enhance native plant cover and richness under the harsh environmental conditions conferred by land abandonment."	2	0	0	0	1	0	2	2022-11-13	WOS:000878029300001	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

To warrant their inclusion in conservation management and policy, we question under which conditions they may exhibit the largest conservation value. Location Nine landscapes spread across the counties of Stockholm and Sodermanland, Sweden. Methods Per landscape, plant communities were surveyed in 6 and 12 1 x 1 m(2) plots across large, intact semi-natural grasslands and small remnant grasslands, respectively. These two contrasting grassland types served as a model system. A topsoil sample was taken in each plot to determine habitat quality in terms of soil pH, plant-available P, and C:N ratio. We used a joint species distribution model to analyse the extent to which grassland type and habitat quality define and predict resident community diversity and composition, including whether they support grassland specialists. Results At the landscape scale, the combined remnant grasslands sustained diverse plant communities which did include a significant subset of habitat specialists. Yet, the contribution of individual remnants clearly varied with local-scale habitat quality; soil phosphorus availability lowered plot-level species richness, mostly by constraining the occurrence of grassland specialists. Semi-natural grassland communities were comparatively insensitive to variation in soil phosphorus availability. Conclusions The combined habitat amount and the significant number of habitat specialists sustained by remnant grasslands with high habitat quality, shows they can represent a valuable resource to support landscape-scale biodiversity conservation. This offers no wildcard to neglect the continued biotic and abiotic threats on semi-natural grassland plant diversity such as chronic and accumulating P eutrophication, discontinuation of management or poor matrix permeability, as semi-natural grasslands harbour the majority of habitat specialists, while sourcing surrounding remnant grassland communities."	10	1	0	0	9	0	11	2021-07-14	WOS:000667075000013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

We addressed the following questions: (a) which are the floristic groups among NEF and how are they correlated with environmental variables; (b) how many species, genera and families are shared between these floristic groups and which species are unique and indicative of each one; and (c) how does species richness vary between NEF groups? Location Neotropical region. Methods We used cluster and ordination analyses based on 518,004 tree occurrence data available in the NeoTropTree database to identify floristic groups throughout NEF. From the floristic groups identified here, we (a) verified correlations between floristic composition and precipitation, temperature, altitude, and latitude; (b) calculated the number of shared species, genera and families, and identified taxa unique to each group; and (c) obtained indicator species and estimated species richness for these floristic groups. Results We recorded 172 families, 1,276 genera and 15,134 species in 1,885 sites of NEF. The families most rich in species were Fabaceae, Rubiaceae and Myrtaceae. We identified nine groups among the NEF, which broadly correspond to floristic provinces reported in the literature. Altitude and annual mean temperature were associated with a species turnover gradient from Amazon to Andean Cloud Forest. Atlantic Forest (south) and Mesoamerica plus Caribbean (north) represented the extremes of a latitudinal gradient. The Atlantic Forest presented the largest number of exclusive and indicator species (2,477 and 265, respectively), while the Amazon showed the highest species richness (6,167 species). Conclusions Although it was possible to separate NEF into distinct floristic groups, this floristic dissociation seems to be recent, since it found support only in species data. The floristic groups identified in this study are largely congruent with their geographic distribution and spatial/ecological isolation, and seem to reflect historical, geological and climatic events that occurred in the Neotropics."	6	0	0	0	4	0	6	2020-09-21	WOS:000566840500001	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

How do historic land use, biotic and environmental factors influence plant community composition, particularly in terms of non-native species abundance and dominance? Location Zumwalt Prairie Preserve, Wallowa County, Oregon, USA. Methods We sampled 123 plots using point-intercept methods within a stratified random sampling approach. We analyzed community variation using cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling, and related composition and non-native plant abundance to historical land use, biotic and environmental variables using joint plots, linear regression, and non-parametric multiplicative regression. Results While native perennial grasses were the most abundant species, non-native species accounted for 27% of species encountered and four of the ten most abundant species were non-native annual grasses (e.g., Ventenata dubia) or non-native perennial grasses (e.g., Poa pratensis). Abundance patterns of non-native perennial grasses differed markedly from those of non-native annual grasses; non-native perennial grasses were concentrated in old fields, while non-native annual grasses were abundant in moisture-limited uncultivated sites. Conclusions Despite its protected status, non-native plant species pose a serious threat to the biotic integrity of the Preserve, with unknown consequences to ecosystem dynamics and function. Moreover, patterns of non-native abundance vary considerably, with different species responding individually to land-use, environmental, and biotic gradients.

Is it possible to use prescribed burning to reduce fire hazard and simultaneously maintain conservation status in such habitat types? Location Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, Portugal. Methods We assessed differences in plant species composition, plant diversity, vegetation structure and above-ground plant biomass between plots treated with prescribed burning (two, four and six years after fire) and untreated plots in a mosaic of Natura 2000 dry shrub-grasslands, and assessed potential fire behaviour differences between treatments. Results Plant species richness and diversity were higher two and four years after prescribed burning, in comparison with untreated plots. Cover of herbaceous species and non-resprouters was higher, and cover of shrubs was lower, but only two years after fire. Habitat structure and phytovolume of the indicator species Ulex jussiaei was affected negatively up to six years after prescribed burning, indicating changes in conservation status from Favourable to Unfavourable. Prescribed burning reduced above-ground biomass and fire simulations showed that potential fire hazard was also reduced, particularly in two-year-old plots. Conclusions Prescribed burning increased plant diversity in the short term, reduced fuel loads and fire hazard, but negatively affected habitat conservation status.

Therefore, we investigate how germination and early development are affected by soil conditions from different restoration phases and how this relates to their specific plant strategies.LocationGrasslands and experiments in northern Belgium.MethodsWe selected three grassland restoration phases (Lolium perenne grasslands, grass-herb mix grasslands and species-rich Nardus grasslands), which were characterized by a distinct plant community and soils with contrasting abiotic and biotic properties (respectively, eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic soils). In a first germination experiment we investigated the species-specific responses (germination, lag time and emergence rate) of 70 grassland species (that typically occur along the restoration gradient) in each of the selected soils. Second, a mesocosm experiment was set-up in which a mixture of 19 species (representative of the distinct grassland restoration phases) was grown together in the respective soils. Here, we analysed the intraspecific variation of plant growth, SLA and identified changes in community assembly.ResultsIrrespective of soil influences, Nardus grassland species had significantly lower germination potentials and longer germination lag times than L. perenne grassland species. Germination (and its lag time) of grass-herb mix grassland species were negatively affected by the oligotrophic soils. Soil factors determined early growth patterns during the emergence and establishment phase. L. perenne grassland species exhibited a more plastic growth response and were highly dependent on soil type. Nardus grassland species exhibited large intraspecific variation in SLA, which was found to be significantly lower in the oligotrophic soils. Even though the difference in bio-available P between mesotrophic and oligotrophic soils was minor, Nardus grassland species were only able to compete in the oligotrophic soils (no significant difference in biomass between communities). Mesotrophic mesocosms exhibited the highest species richness after 200d of growth.ConclusionPlant species from the three grassland restoration phases display distinct germination strategies, irrespective of soil type. Interactions between growth strategies and soil factors determine competitive asymmetry and therefore shape community assembly in the distinct grassland phases."	7	0	0	0	8	0	8	2017-10-20	WOS:000412077700007	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In recent decades, however, agricultural intensification for hay production has led to dramatic declines in their biodiversity. This study asks: which management practices can contribute to maintaining the biodiversity value of mountain hay meadows without jeopardizing agricultural revenue?LocationEleven semi-natural meadows, canton of Valais, inner Alps, southwest Switzerland.MethodsWe experimentally measured the effects of various intensities of fertilization (slurry) and aerial irrigation (sprinklers) on the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity of plants. The experiment consisted of six different treatments, each randomly applied to one of six plots within a meadow. A plot therefore was (1) not irrigated and only fertilized with slurry, (2) not fertilized and only irrigated with a sprinkler, (3-5) receiving low, medium or high amounts of both fertilizer and water, respectively, or (6) receiving no input of irrigation or fertilizer (control plots).ResultsAfter 4yr, all biodiversity metrics were negatively impacted under the highest management intensity (irrigation combined with fertilization at concentrations corresponding to the input necessary to achieve maximum local hay yield, i.e. three-thirds of inputs). In contrast, at low- and mid-intensity management levels (irrigation combined with fertilization at one-third and two-thirds of the maximum concentration, respectively) most diversity metrics did not differ from the controls, except for forb species richness, which was already reduced under mid-intensity management compared to low-intensity and control plots. Neither irrigation nor fertilization alone had a negative impact on plant biodiversity.ConclusionsLow to moderate agricultural intensification of hay production does not appear to be detrimental to plant biodiversity among mountain meadows. These results suggest that sustainable management would be obtained via irrigation and fertilization corresponding to one-third to two-thirds of the quantity necessary to achieve maximum local hay yield."	10	0	0	0	8	0	11	2017-07-04	WOS:000403676000005	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	YES

After 3yr, mean cover of F. ovina was 1.4 times higher than mean P. alpina cover and more than three times higher than mean L. multiflora cover for single species treatments, and four (P. alpina) and 15 (L. multiflora) times higher when the species were seeded together. L. multiflora germinated slowly in the greenhouse experiment, which could partly explain its poor field performance. In the field experiment, establishment was faster in organic soils than mineral soils for all seeding treatments. The largest difference between F. ovina and L. multiflora performance in the mixture treatment was found in the organic soil types, where overall cover was larger than in the mineral soils. In the organic soils, F. ovina was slightly facilitated in the mixture treatment, while the opposite was found for L. multiflora.ConclusionWhen the restoration goal is to quickly establish a vegetation cover, seeding monocultures of rapidly establishing species may be more effective than seeding mixtures, even in alpine sites, where interspecific facilitation may prevail."	7	0	0	0	6	0	7	2017-07-04	WOS:000403676000002	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Have temporal changes led to a further differentiation between communities?Location: Ancient, beech-dominated forest region on limestone in central Germany.Methods: We compared vegetation releves sampled between 1955 and 1960 and resurveyed between 2009 and 2012 on quasi-permanent plots in the CariciFagetum primuletosum (n = 26) on dry, nutrient-poor and sun-exposed slopes, and in the Hordelymo-Fagetum allietosum ( n = 25) on nutrient-rich plateau sites with mesic soils in spring. We concentrated on changes in species richness, vegetation structure and vegetation composition, identified winner and loser species and calculated pair-wise dissimilarity indices within and between communities to test for differentiation or homogenization over time.Results: Our results show a more pronounced change in community composition in the Carici-Fagetum primuletosum within 50 yr compared to the Hordelymo-Fagetum allietosum. Despite no significant increase in total canopy cover, shade-tolerant, mesophilous, nutrient-demanding species expanded, whereas light-demanding, drought-tolerant, oligotrophic, often Red List species decreased. Changes in the Hordelymo-Fagetum allietosum were more random. Overall, vegetation dynamics led to a homogenization between the two contrasting communities caused by a loss of specialized species from the CariciFagetum community and a gain in generalist species in both communities.Conclusion: The drastic changes in the Carici-Fagetum community indicate the higher susceptibility of marginal sites - that often have a high conservation value - to local environmental changes. In particular, N deposition and the abandonment of former ( more traditional) forestmanagement, such as coppicewith- standards and wood pasture, are responsible for this development. On the other hand, the increasing temperatures from climate change are not sufficient to secure the survival of the once frequent thermophilous species. Therefore, adequate forest management and conservation measures, such as the removal of competitive or exotic tree species or the re-establishment of coppice-withstandards management, are necessary to counteract the on- going biotic homogenization of beech forest communities and should focus onmarginal sites."	48	0	0	0	42	0	50	2017-04-01	WOS:000398083700012	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	YES

As most trees were planted and non-tree species (sub-shrub, shrub, herbs, epiphytes, climbers and hemi-parasitic plants) were mostly naturally established, we analysed them in separate analyses. We compared species richness, functional diversity, redundancy and originality among sites. Moreover, we identified optimal subsets of flower traits to describe vegetation succession trends.Results(1) Flower functional diversity of tree species could be achieved after two decades of restoration, but remained far from reference values for non-tree species. The same gap regarding reference values occurred with species richness, which increased over restoration periods, although were far from the reference values. Redundancy and functional diversity are not related to restoration age. (2) Red/burgundy colour, gullet and bell-funnel shape and large size were identified as indicators of the reference forest flowers. Different indicator traits were found for each restoration sites. (3) Sites were similar regarding originality for tree and for non-tree species.ConclusionA highly diverse species pool seems to promise to increase richness and functional diversity of tree species, but not of non-tree species. Trait analyses have important implications for restoration projects and can be used instead of species taxonomic identity, especially for highly diverse tropical forests. Such functional diversity may be advanced through a priori definition of which species from the regional pool can be used in plantings for forest restoration, with special attention to functional traits of non-tree species. Otherwise, restoration sites in highly fragmented landscapes will not reach functional diversity of reference sites, even after a five-decade period."	26	1	0	0	26	1	31	2015-07-01	WOS:000356007400006	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We investigated the extent of these losses at the level of plant community types.LocationTen areas in central Germany with different soil/climate conditions and various arable plant communities.MethodsWe compiled historical surveys of arable fields in the 1950s/early 1960s before the onset of pervasive agricultural industrialization, and in 2009 revisited 392 arable fields. Historical and recent data were compared with supervised manual classification, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and ANOVA.ResultsTen out of 16 plant communities at association rank observed in fields in the 1950s/1960s were not recorded again. The proportion of releves assignable at association level decreased from 75% to 5%, while the proportion of releves assignable only at higher syntaxon level or not assignable at all had increased from 2% to 75%. The impoverishment of vegetation was slightly less pronounced at field margins, where around one quarter of the recent releves could be assigned to associations. Present arable plant communities in the region are species-poor and consist chiefly of common, often herbicide-tolerant, generalist species, with no clear preference for cereal vs root crops, autumn- vs spring-sown crops or base-rich vs base-poor soils.ConclusionOur new approach using phytosociological syntaxa and a semi-permanent plot design enabled us to quantify biodiversity losses at the community type level. The currently used set of phytosociological associations is inadequate to represent present-day arable plant assemblages.

What are the environmental determinants for the distribution of Chinese beech forests? What is the interspecific relationship among the Fagus species and with Quercus in the communities?Location: The natural range of four Chinese Fagus species, including subtropical mainland China and Taiwan Island.Methods: Beech forests were sampled in 28 mountains. Community clustering and canonical correspondence analysis was applied to visualize species composition differences of the community types, and divergent environmental requirements of different Fagus species. The niche overlap among different Fagus species and with different subgroups of Quercus was measured. Based on generalized linear models, hierarchical variation partitioning was applied to estimate the contributions of climatic and topographic variables to the spatial variation in the abundance of different Fagus and Quercus species.Results: (1) Among the Chinese beech forests dominated by four Fagus species, F.engleriana communities and F.hayatae communities are closer in species composition, as are the F.lucida communities and F.longipetiolata communities. (2) F.longipetiolata has the weakest and F.engleriana the strongest tolerance to freezing. The mainland F.hayatae, F.lucida and the island F.hayatae communities differ prominently along a humidity gradient from dry to wet. The spatial variation of abundance of all Fagus species is primarily related to precipitation seasonality, while the distributions of Quercus species are more sensitive to topographic feature at local scale. (3) The niche overlaps among the Fagus species are low at community level. F.engleriana and F.lucida have higher dominances in the communities than F.hayatae and F.longipetiolata. Quercus species are common components of beech forests in mainland China, but only Quercus subgenus Cyclobalanopsis species occur in F.hayatae communities in Taiwan Island. Different Fagus species have different associations with Quercus species in subgenus Quercus or Cyclobalanopsis.Conclusions: The distribution of beech forests in China is primarily related to the precipitation seasonality of the monsoon climate, and differentiated on both temperature and moisture gradients.

Is their germination and establishment affected by seeding density?Location Limestone quarry spoil, SW Portugal.Methods A glasshouse experiment simulating usual hydroseeding procedures (substrate, time of the year, slurry composition, seed mixture) was performed to evaluate the suitability of six native species (Origanum vulgare, Piptatherum miliaceum, Phagnalon saxatile, Sedum album, S.sediforme, Thymus mastichina) to re-vegetate a Mediterranean quarry. Other native species were added to create the seed mixtures. Three treatments were assayed for each target species sown: (1) alone (T), (2) in a low-density seed mixture (ca. 15gm(-2)), and (3) in a high-density seed mixture (ca. 30gm(-2)). Plants were monitored for 8months.Results The target species were able to germinate, establish and grow when sown alone, but their performance was drastically impaired when included in seed mixtures. This was related to plant morphologies, as some co-seeded species rapidly developed large leaves, which presumably reduced resource availability for the small-leaved seedlings of most target species. Almost no seedlings of the latter survived in the mixture treatments. Low- and high-seeding densities yielded similar plant covers and heights.Conclusions Even when apparently suitable to restore a given site, candidate native species cannot simply be included in current re-vegetation recipes', because their success largely depends on the density and seedling characteristics of the co-seeded species (even if these are also native). The early performance and morphology of the latter must be taken into account in the design of seed mixtures used in restoration actions."	15	0	0	0	10	0	17	2014-10-01	WOS:000342839200013	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Does Brachypodium pinnatum, an expanding native grass, take better advantage of the most dynamic nutrient pulse, that of N, than other dominant native grasses?Location: Aezkoa commons, western Pyrenees.Methods: We scheduled experimental winter burnings in three semi-natural grasslands with incipient shrub encroachment and tracked the short-term physical-chemical changes produced in the soil. During the peak biomass period, we performed a stable isotope field experiment in order to follow the fate of three different chemical forms of labelled N ((NO3-)-N-15, (NH4+)-N-15 and C-13(2)-N-15-glycine) in 48 undisturbed stands of B. pinnatum and Festuca gr. rubra.Results: The soil pools of available phosphorus, potassium and ammonium significantly increased after the fire. Four months later, a pulse of nitrate was also recorded. The isotopic labelling experiment revealed that, although the three forms of N were absorbed by the grasses, significant differences in 15 N tissue enrichment appeared after 48 h. Altogether, the results indicated a higher response of B. pinnatum to the NH4+ pulse than F. rubra, although the latter was able to absorb intact glycine, unlike B. pinnatum.Conclusions: Controlled winter burnings, despite being low intensity, cause a significant release of the main nutrients associated with plant growth. This makes the plant community more susceptible to floristic changes. The field experiment suggests that B. pinnatum may make better use of the post-fire NH4+ pulse than F. rubra. This preferential uptake, together with other competing mechanisms of the species, may trigger the expansion of B. pinnatum in burned areas."	21	0	0	0	16	0	21	2014-07-01	WOS:000337725300006	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

(5) Are spontaneously developed successional stages acceptable from the point of view of ecosystem restoration?LocationExtracted peatlands, bulldozed sites in forests destroyed by air pollution, an emerged bottom of a water reservoir, corridors of former Iron Curtain, artificial fishpond islands and barriers, sedimentary basins, spoil heaps from mining, stone quarries, forest clearings, road verges, sand and gravel-sand pits, ruderal urban sites, river gravel bars and abandoned arable fields, located in various parts of the Czech Republic in Central Europe.MethodsPhytosociological releves were recorded in 10-25m(2) plots located in the centre of representative successional stages defined by their age, ranging from 1 to 100yrs. In total, we obtained 2392 vegetation samples containing 951 species. We performed DCA ordination to compare 19 seres. Desirable target species were considered as those representing (semi)-natural vegetation and all Red List species.ResultsThe seres studied are more similar in their species composition in the initial and early stages, in which synathropic species prevail, than in the later stages when the vegetation differentiates. This divergence is driven mainly by local moisture conditions. In most cases, succession led to woodland, which usually established after ca. 20yrs. In very dry or wet places (with limited presence of woody species) open vegetation developed, often highly valuable from the restoration and conservation point of view. The total number of species and the number of target species increased in the majority of seres with successional age.ConclusionsThe vegetation in the sites studied formed a continuum along a moisture gradient and by successional age. The individual seres largely overlapped in their species composition; the sere identity was not significant. Spontaneous succession usually proceeded towards woodland, except at very dry or wet sites, and generally appeared to be an ecologically suitable way of ecosystem restoration of disturbed sites because target species became dominant over time."	120	1	0	0	96	0	128	2014-04-01	WOS:000332774800002	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We re-visited each old P.ponderosa located on permanent 0.1-ha plots installed across the landscape prior to treatment implementation and recorded tree status, diameter, aspect, slope and competition from neighbouring trees. Growth was analysed from shallow increment cores taken from each tree at breast height (1.37m). Comparisons of growth between the treated and untreated areas were carried out using regional proxy and instrumental Palmer drought severity index values and instrument precipitation data.ResultsWe found significant differences in precipitation and temperature between the treated and untreated areas, indicating a drier, less advantageous climate in the untreated area. Old trees in the treated area responded less negatively in diameter growth to treatments; both treatment and abiotic site factors were important in predicting post-treatment growth. All old trees grew slowly during drought years; however, old trees in the treated area grew better after three recent drought years than old trees in the untreated area.ConclusionsOld P.ponderosa diameter growth increased following restoration, though not immediately. Old trees in the treated area also grew better in the years after drought than old trees in the untreated area.

These analyses provide no ecological explanation to why certain species change in abundance. One solution may be a functional trait analysis. We asked whether shifts in functional traits could explain vegetation changes in fens restored through tree cutting and rewetting, and how the functional traits in the restored sites compare to those of the reference site?Location: Three former rich fens in east-central Sweden.Methods: Tree cutting and rewetting were applied in a factorial design, and species and abundance data were recorded for 8yrs. Abundance data and trait data of canopy height, specific leaf area (SLA) and diaspore mass were used to calculate functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), functional dispersion (FDis) and community-weighted mean (CWM) of functional traits. Data were analysed in a linear mixed effect model for vascular plants and bryophytes jointly, and for vascular plants separately. Results of restoration treatments were compared to data from a reference site.Results: Among vascular plants, tree cutting caused a decrease in SLA, as shade-sensitive species increased. In accordance with the change in SLA, FDis increased. In the joint analysis, tree cutting led to increased FDis, FDiv and FRic, indicating reduced filtering caused by the removal of the shading canopy, which allowed shade-sensitive species to establish. The comparison to the reference site shows that even after 8yrs, the restoration treatments have higher trait diversity than the reference site, indicating that the restoration sites have a too relaxed trait filter compared to conditions in an undisturbed fen. Our interpretation is that this is primarily caused by insufficient rewetting (and increased nutrient availability) that allow species of both natural and degraded fen conditions to co-exist, and which failed to suppress the regrowth of trees.Conclusions: Analysis of functional diversity improves our understanding of the ecological mechanisms affecting restoration results, and allows comparison among regions and communities with different species composition."	26	1	0	0	22	0	31	2013-10-01	WOS:000324090800012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location The Bighorn River, the Yellowstone River and the Fort Peck Reservoir, Montana, western USA. Methods Soil was collected from paired subsites where Tamarix was either present or absent along three water bodies. To evaluate chemical and biological soil effects on plant growth, eight plant species (Achnatherum hymenoides, Astragalus cicer, Dalea candida, Elymus lanceolatus, Leymus cinereus, Pascopyrum smithii, Ratibida columnifera and Trifolium pratense) commonly used in restoration projects at Tamarix-invaded sites were grown in the collected soil. Plant-soil feedbacks were evaluated by growing two species (D.candida and P.smithii) in greenhouse soils inoculated with small amounts of the field soils. Germination, emergence and growth characteristics were compared between Tamarix-invaded and un-invaded subsites and across water bodies. Results Seedling emergence and plant relative growth rate, total biomass production and allocation of resources to roots and shoots were not negatively affected in field soils or in greenhouse soil inoculated with soil from areas where Tamarix was present. In fact, overall, plants emerged earlier and produced more biomass in soils affected by Tamarix than in soils from where Tamarix was not present. These results indicate that for sites in the northern range of Tamarix, restoration would not be inhibited by Tamarix-induced soil changes. Conclusions Tamarix is a relatively new invader in the northern USA, and little is known about its impacts in this area or the potential implications for restoration. However, our results indicate that neither altered soil chemistry nor plant-soil feedbacks negatively impact native plant growth, and restoration efforts would not be hindered by Tamarix-induced changes to soil chemistry or microbiota."	2	0	0	0	2	0	3	2013-07-10	WOS:000319885000009	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Location Abandoned cattle pasture, in the humid tropics of SE Mexico (18 degrees 2518 degrees 45N, 95 degrees 0095 degrees 18W). Methods The establishment of four native fast-growing tree species in a tropical abandoned pasture was evaluated. Saplings of Cecropia obtusifolia, Hampea nutricia, Omphalea oleifera and Erythrina folkersii were transplanted using a split-plot design. Plant survival and growth were evaluated over 12mo under two experimental treatments: presence and absence of grasses. Light incidence at ground level was used to evaluate microclimate conditions under the grass matrix, compared to light incidence under saplings established in the pasture. Results Saplings had high survival (4988%) regardless of the presence of grasses. In the presence of grasses, growth of surviving saplings either increased or was not impacted, and in only one out of eight comparisons did grasses negatively affect growth. The impact of saplings on light incidence in abandoned pastures depended on sapling species architecture: species with large total leaf area and canopy area ( H.nutricia and E.folkersii) significantly reduced light incidence (1229% of total incidence), while narrow-canopy species ( C.obtusifolia and O.oleifera) generated less intense shade (3789% of total incidence). Conclusions Grasses did not seem to represent a crucial limiting factor in sapling establishment of fast-growing native species in the short term. In addition, shading by recruited saplings of some native species could be important to out-compete grasses in the future, as well as for facilitating' regeneration of more shade-tolerant species. Transplantation of fast-growing native saplings into abandoned pastures, even without manipulation of the grasses, could be a useful practice for landscape-scale restoration programmes in tropical areas. Evaluation of the longer-term consequences (beyond the 1-yr span of this study) warrants further research."	19	0	0	0	13	3	20	2013-04-03	WOS:000315690500014	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

We found that forest and shrubland loss on one side and regeneration on the other often displayed opposite patterns in relation to the different explanatory variables. Deforestation was positively related to distance to primary roads and to distance within forest edges and was favoured by a low insolation and a low slope. In turn, forest regeneration was negatively related to the distance to primary roads and positively to the distance to the nearest forest patch, insolation and slope. Shrubland loss was positively influenced by slope and distance to cities and primary roads and negatively influenced by distance to rivers. Conversely, shrubland regeneration was negatively related to slope, distance to cities and distance to primary roads and positively related to distance from existing forest patches and distance to rivers.Conclusions: This article reveals how biophysical and socioeconomic factors influence vegetation cover change and the underlying social, political and economical drivers.

Restoration and management of degraded pine savanna ecosystems is critical. Identification of ecological processes that determine the structure and function of the intact system are important because successful restoration efforts should be based on sound scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce this special issue on the ecology, conservation, and restoration of the Pinus palustris ecosystem.

What effects does prescribed burning have on nutrient balances, particularly as regards the limiting nutrients N and P?Location: Lueneburg Heath, NW Germany.Methods: In two burning experiments (in 10115 year old Calluna-stands) nutrient balances (for N, Ca, K, Mg, P) were calculated by analysing nutrient inputs (atmospheric deposition, ash deposition), nutrient stores (above-ground biomass, organic horizon) and nutrient outputs (biomass combustion, leaching).Results: Atmospheric nutrient deposition amounted to 22.8 kg.ha(-1).a(-1) for N and < 0.5 kg.ha(-1).a(-1) for P. Nutrient stores in the above-ground biomass were 95/197 kg.ha(-1) for N and 5/13 kg.ha(-1) for P (first/second experiment, respectively). From these stores 90/53% (for N) and 25/14% (for P) were removed by burning. Effects of leaching on nutrient balances were low. In the first two years after burning, leaching rates of N increased by about 4/6 kg.ha(-1), whereas leaching rates of P did not change significantly. Input/output-ratios showed that prescribed burning leads to positive nutrient balances for N, Ca and Mg in the long term. For example, the amounts of N removed by prescribed burning are equivalent to ca. five years of atmospheric inputs. Applied in ten-year cycles, this measure alone cannot prevent N accumulation in the long term.Conclusion: Regarding 10/15 year old Ca/luna-heaths, we assume that prescribed burning cannot compensate for atmospheric N inputs, thus making long-term changes in the nutritional state inevitable. Therefore, prescribed burning should be applied in combination with high-intensity management measures."	55	1	0	0	45	0	60	2005-11-01	WOS:000235079600009	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

Gradient analysis was carried out by means of Canonical Correspondence Analysis.Results: Sod-cutting. in combination with re-wetting measures (infilling of ditches and drains), led to restoration of communities of soft-water pools and small sedge marshes within five years. This rapid recovery is probably related to the presence of persistent seed banks of the component species of these communities. Complete restoration of fen meadows took longer (10-15 yr). Apparently, many species of fen meadows have short-lived seed banks. Sod-cutting of a degraded wet heathland and a soft-water pool was only successful temporarily. probably as a consequence of low water tables.Conclusions: To prevent depletion of (persistent) soil seed banks. sod-cutting in nutrient-poor wetlands is not recommended in areas where the groundwater regime and the base status of the soil can not be restored to levels required by plant communities of wet heathlands."	20	0	0	0	18	0	23	2004-11-01	WOS:000225645800012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

If a member state reclaims an area that is protected by these directives, it has to take compensational measures. When such an area includes saline grasslands that require very specific abiotic conditions, a place with similar conditions must be available to re-establish those grasslands at another location in a sustainable way. This will limit the number and extent of possible sites for compensation.In the conflict between economy and ecology in the Schelde polders, Flanders has chosen to expand the port of Antwerp in the polders at the left Schelde bank and destroy a protected saline grassland site. As a consequence, it has to compensate for this loss. Therefore, we made a detailed study of the hydrology, geology and soil conditions of the endangered saline grassland site. The same was done in four possible compensation sites, all situated in nearby polders. We found that the presence of upwelling groundwater flowing through a saline peat layer is necessary for the occurrence of saline grasslands. Only in one of the four possible compensation sites, called Muggenhoek, we found such conditions. So, we indicate this place as a possible site for the re-creation of saline grasslands and give some recommendations for their development."	3	0	0	0	2	0	3	2003-12-01	WOS:000220133300007	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

This paper aims to identify colonizing key species among the pioneer vegetation of limestone quarries in Lebanon, to identify potential restoration strategies in terms of reconstitution of the pre-mining vegetation cover. Characteristics of the major ground colonizers after disturbance were identified in a representative quarry in the thermo-Mediterranean biozone. The floristic inventories resulted in a matrix of cover values of 107 species x 14 plots. Correspondence analyses were used to pinpoint similarities in the distribution of key species among the different environmental characteristics of sites. The main results reveal a heterogeneous floristic composition along the regeneration gradient, where annual R-strategy taxa such as Inula viscosa and Ainsworthia cordata dominate on very perturbed and degraded sites. Less degraded areas within the quarry were rich in herbaceous perennial or shrub species such as Geranium dissection, Stachys distans, Salvia triloba and Ptilostemon chamaepeuce. On relatively non-degraded areas woody and shrub perennials such as Pinus brutia, Pistacia palaestina and Quercus calliprinos dominate, along with less stress tolerant taxa such as Arbutus andrachne and Cistus creticus. Species to be used in restoration projects should be chosen from among the local vegetation, according to frequency of occurrence during the whole succession process which will reflect their adaptability to local conditions and their relevance to restoration objectives."	46	11	0	0	37	0	64	2003-12-01	WOS:000220133300012	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

In this study we aimed to find out how successfully the local species richness of an overgrown semi-natural mesic meadow could be restored by sheep grazing after a long period of abandonment. The cover of vascular plant species in grazed plots and ungrazed exclosures was studied for five years and the responses of different functional plant groups were followed (herbs vs grasses, tall vs short species, species differing in flowering time, species representing different Grime's CSR strategies and species indicative of rich vs poor soil). Grazing increased species number by nearly 30%. On grazed plots the litter cover practically disappeared, favouring small herbs such as Rhinanthus minor, Ranunculus acris, Trifolium pratense and the grass Agrostis capillaris. Grazing decreased the cover of the late flowering tall herb Epilobium angustifolium but had no effect on the abundance of the early flowering tall herbs Anthriscus sylvestris or Geranium sylvaticum. We suggest that to succeed in restoration it is useful to determine the responses of different functional plant groups to grazing. Grassland managers need this information to optimize the methods and timing of management used in restoration. Additional management practices, such as mowing, may be needed in mesic meadows to decrease the dominance of tall species.

Applied Vegetation Science	NA	28	e70026	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/avsc.70026	Journal article	2025	2025	"Background: Seed banks play a crucial role in population replenishment, community succession, and ecosystem resilience. In floodplain wetlands, seed banks may display seasonal dynamics that are influenced by seasonal flooding and temperature; however, seasonal dynamics remain poorly understood. Location: Two dominant macrophyte communities in the Dongting Lake wetlands, China. Methods: We investigated seed-bank densities, vertical distributions, and species richness of two dominant macrophyte communities in the Dongting Lake wetlands during November 2017 (after flooding), January (winter), March (spring), and May 2018 (before flooding). Results:CarexandMiscanthuscommunity seed-bank densities peaked in May (15,307 and 17,330 individuals/m2, respectively), decreased from November to March, and were the lowest in January (440 and 627 individuals/m2, respectively).CarexandMiscanthuscommunity seed-bank densities declined rapidly with soil depth during May from 13,414 and 16,535 individuals/m2in the 0-5 cm soil layer to 254 and 42 individuals/m2in the 10-20 cm soil layer, respectively. The species richness ofCarexandMiscanthuscommunity seed banks peaked during May (7 and 8 species, respectively). However, species similarity with extant communities was low (0.23 and 0.27, respectively). Conclusions: The results of this study emphasize the significance of seasons and stratification in the utilization of soil seed banks for floodplain wetland restoration. Supplementary measures such as bud banks and introduced seedlings should be adopted for the successful restoration of macrophyte communities because of the low density and richness of perennial species in seed banks."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2025-08-21	CABI:20250230281	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	YES

The aims of this paper are to (1) critically examine the model of environmental variability employed in their analysis, (2) evaluate the appropriateness of the statistical methods used in their analyses, and (3) demonstrate that despite the limitations in their approach the models actually worked well and refute the conclusions reached by Kusbach, Shaw & Long.LocationInterior western USA including Utah, SE Idaho, W Wyoming and Colorado, N Arizona, NW New Mexico and E Nevada.MethodsI examined the methods and results presented in Kusbach, Shaw & Long with respect to (1) the suitability of the model of environmental biophysics, (2) the appropriateness of the statistical methods employed, (3) the significance of the results obtained, and (4) the logical validity of the interpretations presented by the authors. I estimated the statistical significance of their predictive model results using a cumulative binomial probability based on the number of sample plots/type and the observed number of correct predictions obtained in their analyses. I estimated the probability of obtaining within-type dispersions in PCA using a Monte Carlo randomization technique.ResultsThe models of environmental biophysics employed in Kusbach, Shaw & Long are poorly developed and inadequate in representing the primary ecological factors structuring the distribution of vegetation in the study region. The statistical model employed assumes that potential natural vegetation types are simply categorical, when in fact they are instances of a multidimensional ordinal variable. The failure to weight errors resulting from the model presents a vastly exaggerated error distribution. However, despite the shortcomings in the model of environmental biophysics and the inappropriate statistical tests, their results are in fact highly significant and argue for conclusions diametrically opposed to those presented by the authors."	6	0	0	0	6	0	6	2015-09-30	WOS:000361181500019	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NO

By employing extensive and traditional grazing and browsing regimes, conservation actions support biodiversity and recovery in natural and degraded areas. However, grazing also plays other important ecological roles, for example, in the maintenance and/or recovery of important ecosystem services, such as biomass production and carbon sequestration. Understanding herbivore effects on plant composition and functional diversity, and ecosystem functioning and services, is essential for informing ecological theory and practice. The current Special Issue highlights that the effects of grazing on vegetation are strongly context-dependent. The articles identify at least three major factors acting in concert, which are responsible for contrasting diversity and functional patterns of vegetation subjected to herbivores: (i) herbivore identity; (ii) grazing intensity; and (iii) vegetation type. Insights from this Special Issue imply that long-term experiments across different habitat types and in underrepresented regions are needed to provide valuable information for grazing planning and management. They also demonstrate that integrating indigenous and traditional ecological knowledge, and considering socio-economic contexts, can provide opportunities for improving sustainable grazing management."	15	0	0	0	7	0	15	2024-07-18	WOS:001266845000001	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NO

Although reliance on primary botanical data seems to be decreasing in favor of database records, field- and laboratory-based identification remains essential for producing high-quality scientific outcomes. Nevertheless, this expertise is often undervalued in terms of scientific authorship and academic recognition. This forum article highlights the historical and contemporary importance of plant identification, examines the factors contributing to its decline, and advocates for the explicit inclusion of identification work in author contribution statements in journals affiliated with the International Association for Vegetation Science (IAVS) and beyond. Where feasible, it also recommends linking deposited herbarium specimens of a specific paper to a DOI through dedicated platforms.

Understanding human disturbances and human effects on natural disturbance regimes is a key to establishing restoration goals and initiating restoration projects. However, as this literature has developed, the picture has become both more interesting and more complex: Disturbances interact; each disturbance leaves behind a patch work of effects; and particular disturbances have different effects in different seasons and from one year to another. In addition, different species respond differently to the same disturbance. We are left with questions such as: Can we predict vegetation response to fire in restoration projects? Clearly, we must understand the mechanisms of species response to disturbance in order to answer these questions and achieve a predictive science. The Editor's Award for 2005 goes to a paper that treats interactions of fire and mowing in a long-term experiment: Long-term composition responses of a South African mesic grassland to burning and mowing by Fynn, Morris & Edwards (2005). The authors report on the 50+ year Ukulinga burning and mowing experiment at the research farm of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. This experiment, initiated in 1950, is remarkable: three replicates in a randomized split-plot, full-factorial design with four whole-plot and I I subplot treatments. Mowing treatments included none to early season, late season, and early-plus-late season. Fire treatments were none, annual, biennial, and triannual in winter, spring or autumn. In sum, plot disturbance ranged from protection over 50 years to twice summer mowing plus mowing or fire in the dormant season each year. The authors found that grasses responded to type of disturbance and fire frequency, but forbs were less sensitive to disturbance type. The disturbance combinations controlled vegetation structure and composition, with some combinations producing a short-grass community and others a tall-grass community. Tillering strategy (below or above ground) for grasses and habit (erect or creeping) for forbs explained many responses and are a means to predict differing responses of grasses and herbs and different responses of species within each group to disturbance combinations. The conclusion of the study suggests that the highest diversity and greatest number of species (as well as benefits for wildlife species) can be achieved by applying results at the landscape scale to create patches of diverse structures from simple combinations of disturbance type and season. The authors also found transient responses and compensatory changes among species, thus demonstrating the importance of long-term and experimental research."	2	1	0	0	2	0	4	2006-05-01	WOS:000242292500001	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NO

The current Special Feature contains eight vegetation survey studies from North America, New Zealand, Europe and Asia. Most of these studies describe diversity of important vegetation types across large areas and some are also innovative from the methodological viewpoint.
